Artist's handyman is convicted of hiding stolen works,,,"Link to Image LONDON - One September day in 2010, a man who said he was the former electrician of Pablo Picasso entered the Paris office of the Picasso estate, wheeling a suitcase filled with 271 of the Spaniard's works. The electrician, Pierre Le Guennec, had traveled from his home in southern France with his wife, Danielle. He said he wanted to authenticate 180 watercolor paintings, lithographs, and Cubist collages, as well as two notebooks with 91 drawings.","FULL TEXT The treasure trove had been in their garage for almost 40 years, he said, gifts from Picasso decades earlier. Thus began a nearly 10-year saga in which a lawsuit claimed that the works were ""stolen goods""; police began an investigation; courts heard contradictory testimony; and multiple appeals and hearings took the defendants and Picasso's heirs all the way to France's top appeals court. It culminated this past week in a decision by a top French court confirming the convictions of Le Guennec and his wife for receiving and concealing stolen artwork. It was the third time they were found guilty, but Pierre and Danielle Le Guennec, 80 and 76, are not going to jail. The court handed the couple two-year suspended sentences. They were not present for the final verdict. Pierre Le Guennec said in a telephone interview Saturday that the couple had learned of the ruling through neighbors and a newspaper article. The couple have always denied stealing the artwork. He had been employed as an electrician and handyman in various homes of the artist in southern France in the early 1970s, fixing an oven and setting up an alarm system in at least one property, among other duties. His wife told The New York Times in 2010 that ""my husband was getting ready to leave"" one day when Picasso gave him ""a box."" The artist, she added, ""never explained anything."" Among the works are nine rare Cubist collages, a painting from Picasso's iconic Blue Period, watercolors, lithographs, and dozens of drawings in notebooks. They are estimated to be worth several dozens of millions of dollars, although no precise valuation has been done, according to Jean-Jacques Neuer, a lawyer for Picasso's son. They are now housed at the Banque de France. Le Guennec said that he went to the Paris office in 2010 because he had recently learned that he had cancer, and he wanted to secure the provenance of the artwork for his two children. The artist's son, Claude Ruiz-Picasso, and the administrator of the Picasso estate were startled and intrigued, Neuer told news media at the time. Gazing at the unsigned cache and realizing that it was from the famed Spanish artist, they quickly grew suspicious. Ruiz-Picasso knew that his father, a temperamental genius who died in 1973, had been an inveterate collector who gave away only artwork that he had recently made - and he would have signed them. ""If you go see the Picasso estate and tell them, 'These 271 works from Picasso fell from the ceiling,' or, 'I found them at a bric-a-brac market,' no one will believe you,"" Neuer said in a telephone interview Saturday. He said the court ruling this past week marked ""the end of a coverup."" The artwork that Le Guennec hauled in was estimated to have been painted between 1900 and 1932. Anne Baldassari, a former president of the Pablo Picasso Museum in Paris, said at the couple's first trial in 2015, ""The Picasso I know wouldn't let his artworks go. It would be like ripping up one's own skin."" Le Guennec later changed his story, claiming that Jacqueline Roque, Picasso's last wife, and not the artist himself, had given him the artwork. Le Guennec's wife added in the interview that the couple initially said that Picasso had given them the artwork at Roque's instructions. They also said that the works had sat untouched in their garage for more than four decades. But Neuer argued that because the works were in a greatly preserved state, they could not have been stored for so long in a garage in southern France, where they would probably have deteriorated. More contradictions followed, Neuer said. Le Guennec claimed to have cataloged all the artwork on his own. But Baldassari said that the descriptions and comparisons were of ""an academic level."" For one drawing, for example, Le Guennec had drawn a parallel with ""Harlequin,"" an oil painting by Picasso that is now at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But when Neuer asked Le Guennec at the couple's 2015 trial to name Picasso's most famous artwork at MoMA, the former electrician did not know what the New York museum was. He and his wife were convicted that year. A higher court upheld that verdict in 2016, but the ruling was later quashed by the Court of Cassation, France's highest court. The Le Guennecs cannot appeal the final verdict, which was handed down Tuesday by the Lyon Court of Appeal. Neuer speculated that art merchants, probably based in Switzerland, had used Pierre Le Guennec in the same way that traffickers would a drug mule. Le Guennec called such a scenario ""ridiculous.""",['ENGLISH'],865,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-47ZGLYAOGAI6VNI5JO7YRLZ35U,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000104', 'className': 'APPEALS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000CFSU', 'className': 'ART THEFT'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTVENDU3Q0RGQjI0NEM1REEyOUUyRjI5OURFRjQ5MTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEUzMkE2MTZCMThENDAwNDhCM0I4RDA2OURFRDAwNDI', 'className': 'Verdicts'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JU', 'className': 'CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009UKP', 'className': 'PAINTING'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DM0B', 'className': 'PRINTMAKING & ENGRAVING'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg4RkVGMUQ2NDA1NDFGMjk5MUM2RkI2RjdEQjM3RDc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkQxNjZDNzE1NDc3NDIyNDhFNjM0MDNERERCNUVCM0M', 'className': 'Stolen Property'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001932', 'className': 'CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUIzQ0NGRDZERUU3NERCODg2MEZFMDI2RTI0RTA3RTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk', 'className': 'Sentencing'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjdFQTZCOEY3MkQ1NDc3Qzk1OTg3RDAyQjY4OEI3N0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM5QzgwQzJDRkFDNDUwM0IxQTdBRjUyODFDN0U0Q0Y', 'className': 'Testimony'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N922110GJ', 'className': 'APPEALS COURTS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N922110CC', 'className': 'LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX000105', 'className': 'APPELLATE DECISIONS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX001648', 'className': 'SUITS & CLAIMS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'ST000D4JV', 'className': 'CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001544', 'className': 'SECURITY & ALARM SYSTEMS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '68', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001544', 'className': 'SECURITY & ALARM SYSTEMS'}], 'city': [{'score': '71', 'classCode': 'GX115', 'className': 'PARIS, FRANCE'}], 'country': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GC317', 'className': 'FRANCE'}]}"
1,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,"AP source: NBA, teams, union discuss shortening season",,,"Link to Image Link to Image The NBA may be closer to a shorter season, a new postseason format and the in-season tournament Commissioner Adam Silver has long wanted as well.","A person familiar with the negotiations said Saturday the NBA is working with the players' union and its teams on a plan to shorten the regular season, possibly to 78 games. They also are considering a change to the playoff seeding and the addition of a midyear tournament for all 30 clubs in time for the 2021-22 season. The tournament would likely be a way for teams to mitigate the loss of revenue from the shorter regular season and fewer home dates. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no update on the plan has been publicly given by the league. ESPN first reported the progression of the plan on Saturday. The proposal could be sent to the league's board of governors in April for discussion and possibly ratification. NBA broadcast partners ESPN and Turner Sports also are involved in the talks. ESPN also reported the proposal includes a plan to reseed the playoffs after early rounds, potentially creating an NBA Finals between teams from the same conference. The notion of adding a midseason tournament has been something Silver has batted around since at least 2016, drawing the parallel to how such events are customary in European soccer. ""It would need to be negotiated with the Players Association,"" Silver said this year. ""I've had very general discussions with (union executive director) Michele Roberts about the notion that these are the kinds of things we're looking at. I think she, of course, is supportive of looking at any ideas we have to build the business over time."" The same applies to having a play-in playoff round, which Silver has said he supports. That idea has even reached the proposal stage, reviewed by the league's competition committee and others. The possibility of changing the playoff seeding has been talked about for some time as well. But the drawback to any shortening of the schedule - and perhaps fewer home games - is a decrease in revenue, which everyone would want to avoid. That's where the tournament comes into play, especially since it would involve all teams. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and            https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",['ENGLISH'],383,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-4L6JI6IWWJFWZC6YZGTE42RVFM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001615', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000171', 'className': 'BASKETBALL'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001407', 'className': 'PROFESSIONAL SPORTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000A0TH', 'className': 'BASKETBALL TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001587', 'className': 'SOCCER'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'STX000194', 'className': 'BOARDS OF DIRECTORS'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DMC5', 'className': 'ADAM SILVER'}]}"

(AP) England 2 sentenced for hiding treasure LONDON - Two men from Wales were sentenced Friday for failing to follow Britain's rules on reporting discoveries of treasure. George Powell, 38, and Layton Davies, 51, dug up a Viking hoard of gold and silver in 2015 in a field in Eye in western England. Instead of reporting it, as required by law, the two hid some of the items, estimated to be worth millions of pounds, and sold others to dealers. Powell received a total term of 10 years, and Davies was sentenced to 8½ years. The judge told Powell and Davies that the ""irony in the case"" was that if they had followed the correct procedure, they might have been in line to receive up to half the value between them, the BBC reported.

5,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,Mike Pence makes unannounced visit to Iraq,,,"BAGHDAD - Vice President Mike Pence made an unexpected visit to Iraq Saturday, arriving as protests aimed at toppling the Iraqi leadership and changing the political system continued to roil the country.","FULL TEXT Pence made two stops: He landed with the permission of the Iraqi government at Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq's western desert, where many of the American troops are billeted while they train and assist the Iraqi forces fighting the remains of the Islamic State. He then flew to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Pence received a classified briefing at the air base, from where American Special Forces had launched the operation in Syria last month that led to the death of the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He then spoke by phone with Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mehdi but did not meet with him, according to Abdul-Mehdi's office. The US Embassy in Iraq declined to comment on Pence's visit. But Abdul-Mehdi's office said in a statement that the two men ""discussed the latest developments in Iraq and the Iraqi government efforts at reform in response to the demonstrators demands."" In Erbil, Pence met with two powerful Kurdish politicians who are cousins: Nechirvan Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan region, and Masrour Barzani, the prime minister. Pence and his wife, Karen, later served Thanksgiving lunch to approximately 150 troops, and the vice president then delivered remarks to about 200 troops. The vice president thanked the troops for their service. The United States has about 6,000 troops in Iraq. The trip came 11 months after President Trump made a similar unannounced visit to Al-Asad, just days after announcing that he was pulling American troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. It caused a major shake-up in the White House defense and foreign policy team. Trump's plans to meet with Abdul-Mehdi were canceled. The timing of the trip by Pence - the second-most-senior member of the American government - was significant. It underscored the United States' continued engagement in Iraq and was an implicit riposte to Iran, which has often tried to present itself to Iraqi leaders as a more consistent partner than the Americans. Iran has dispatched General Qasem Soleimani, leader of its Quds Force, the most elite arm of the Revolutionary Guard, to help the Iraqis plot a response. The visit also occurred as Iraqi government leaders have struggled to deal with the protests, which have galvanized many in the south of the country as well as in the capital, Baghdad. On Saturday, Iraqi officials said one person had been shot dead and dozens of others wounded as protests continued in the capital. Iran, which sees the uprising in Iraq as a threat that has encouraged a similar movement at home, has advocated a tough response. The United States has lobbied against that approach, encouraging Iraq to work with the nonviolent protesters, but has taken the same view as Iran toward the prime minister. Unlike Iran, the United States wants to see reforms made in the Iraqi system to root out corruption and create an electoral system that is less dominated by sectarian apolitical parties that tend to divide up the spoils and do little to represent the people.

He managed to complete a pass on the play but stayed down and came off the field walking gingerly but without assistance. Penn State coach James Franklin said Clifford could have come back in, but his mobility would have been limited. He chose to stick with Levis and the sophomore provided a spark with his legs - at least for a little while. Levis helped Penn State complete a 75-yard touchdown drive, capped by Journey Brown's 18-yard run, to make it Ohio State 21-7 with 8:19 left in the third quarter. A fumble by Ohio State on its next offensive play set up Penn State in the red zone, and Levis ran for a 1-yard score to make it 21-14 moments later. Another Ohio State fumble led to a Penn State field goal that cut the lead to 21-17, but that was a close as it got. With Levis, the Nittany Lions leaned heavy on the run, and eventually they couldn't make enough plays. Levis finished with 34 yards rushing on 19 carries that included five sacks. He was 6 for 11 for 57 yards passing and threw an interception in the fourth quarter that ended Penn State's last trip into Buckeyes' territory on the day. The Nittany Lions lost 28-17. They finish the regular season next week against Rutgers at home with a chance to finish 10-2 and be in consideration for a major bowl game. ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and            https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",['ENGLISH'],285,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-DSRI5QNOTRFPXPEV3VAXHM2NGI,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000081', 'className': 'AMERICAN FOOTBALL'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000C47H', 'className': 'WOUNDS & INJURIES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000126', 'className': 'ATHLETES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX001615', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001452', 'className': 'RANKINGS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}], 'city': [{'score': '57', 'classCode': 'GX582', 'className': 'COLUMBUS, OH, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '95', 'classCode': 'GS151', 'className': 'OHIO, USA'}, {'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GS154', 'className': 'PENNSYLVANIA, USA'}]}"
7,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",METRO,,Governor Charlie Baker says he doesn't need to ride the T. He's wrong.,,,"""I'm not a virtue signaler."" So said Governor Charlie Baker, batting back the notion that he should ride the MBTA from time to time. When Boston Public Radio host Jim Braude - prompted by last week's Spotlight series on our traffic woes - asked him about it on Thursday, Baker indicated plainly that he thinks hopping on the commuter rail near his home in Swampscott to get to work would be a purely symbolic, and empty, public gesture: virtue signaling. In an interview for the series, the Globe's Andrew Ryan asked Baker if he'd ridden the Tube on a recent trip to London, and Baker got prickly: ""I did. So what?"" he replied.","FULL TEXT Baker, who appears to have taken the T only once in five years as governor, and the commuter rail not at all, told Braude he rode it plenty before he was sworn in. But that's not good enough. And it reflects a view of our transit woes that simply isn't expansive enough. ""Using the system your voters take every day is not virtue signaling, it's doing your homework,"" said Stacy Thompson, head of LivableStreets Alliance, a transportation advocacy group. Besides, isn't it kind of a governor's job to send virtuous signals from time to time? As the series vividly demonstrated, our soul-destroying traffic congestion is not like the weather - beyond our control, immutable. It is not the cruel act of some capricious God. We did this to ourselves. We've all made choices that ensure the car is still king. Baker and other leaders, including a majority of legislators, take cars to work each day. That insulates them from the daily indignities of the public transit system over which they preside. Corporations that have helped grow the region's economy (and traffic)            incentivize car commuting with perks like free or cheap parking. And, thanks to the fact that we now feel entitled to on-demand everything,            drivers are plowing through traffic more clogged by Uber and Lyft rides, and delivery drivers for Amazon, DoorDash, and umpteen other vendors. All of this before the scourge of self-driving cars is upon us. You don't change a car-first culture without considerable effort and, it must be said, some discomfort. Baker believes the answer to our traffic woes lies in improving the public transit system, making it so attractive that even the most inveterate car commuters will be coaxed away from the wheel. That is a big part of the solution. But it's not sufficient to make the T irresistible or (let's not get crazy here) less awful. We also have to make driving less attractive for those who have choices. Yet Baker and others have consistently resisted measures that would do that: congestion pricing, for example, which would make it more expensive to drive into the center of the city at certain times; raising the gas tax; charging residents for parking stickers; upping fees on ride-sharing services. Meanwhile, T fares have been raised twice since Baker took office in 2015. Why, it's almost as if the votes of drivers matter more to our politicians than those of other commuters. When Braude asked why Baker hadn't asked more of motorists, the governor responded, ""keep in mind that everybody in Massachusetts who never uses the T spends a billion dollars a year on it, or more."" But that kind of binary thinking - drivers vs. T-riders - is how we got into this mess in the first place. Having great public transit isn't just good for T riders. It's good for drivers, too, who enjoy less clogged roads if those who can take the T do so. And a better MBTA helps propel our entire economy, which benefits every resident -- even those who never set foot on a trolley. Raising costs for drivers isn't just about raising much-needed revenue to help fund transit: It's also about shifting behavior. Because the forces that keep drivers in their cars are formidable. To be fair, Baker does sometimes talk in terms of moving people, rather than cars, which is exactly the right way to look at it. And obviously, it's not practical for him to take the T every day, or even frequently. But his dismissiveness does signal something: that Baker, at heart, remains as mired in car culture as the rest of us.

(AP) - Auburn police have arrested a second man in the disappearance of a UFC heavyweight fighter's stepdaughter.","Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes told The Associated Press by email Saturday that 35-year-old Antwain Shamar Fisher of Montgomery has been charged with first-degree kidnapping in the disappearance last month of 19-year-old Aniah Blanchard. Fisher was arrested Friday and booked Saturday into the Lee County Jail, Hughes told the Opelika-Auburn News and WRBL-TV.

Mixon testified that convenience store video footage showed a man buying a beverage look over at Blanchard. He said tipsters later identified the man as Ibraheem Yazeed, 29, and a man at the store told investigators he saw Yazeed force Blanchard into her car and drive away. Prosecutors told a Lee County judge that a male's DNA was found in Blanchard's car, and the judge ordered Yazeed on Wednesday to submit a DNA sample.

9,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,"Jones, No. 5 Alabama rout Western Carolina, 66-3 without Tua",,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) - Tua Tagovailoa watched from a cart as his Alabama teammates treated him to a dominant performance against a badly outclassed opponent. Mac Jones passed for 275 yards and three touchdowns in little more than a half and No. 5 Alabama began life without Tagovailoa with a 66-3 romp Saturday over Western Carolina of the Football Championship Subdivision.","With Tagovailoa watching much of the game from behind the bench, the Crimson Tide (10-1) put on a one-sided show against the Catamounts (3-9). The star quarterback, who had hip surgery on Monday, was cheered as he was driven toward the sideline before the game. He didn't have to give much of a pep talk. ""Just his presence,"" Tide wide receiver Jaylen Waddle said. ""Just knowing what he meant to the team. That was enough. He didn't have to say much."" Alabama is fifth in the College Football Playoff rankings and hoping to somehow make the field despite failing to win the SEC West - and losing its biggest star. But this one was about taking care of business after an emotional week, not impressing the selection committee. ""It's not easy to overcome something like that, losing a great leader,"" said Jones, who completed 10 of 12 passes in his second career start. ""But I think we're built for that. We train every day for the whole year mentally and physically. It's really mental toughness and learning how to rebound and respond to adversity."" Alabama forced five turnovers, including Xavier McKinney's 81-yard interception return for a touchdown, and got big plays from Jones and wide receivers DeVonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle. Jones only threw one pass after halftime. Smith had four catches for 94 yards and two touchdowns, including a 57-yarder when he juked a defender before sprinting to the end zone. Waddle produced 101 yards and took a screen 54 yards for a touchdown, then returned a punt 49 yards to near the goal line on his next touch. ""I thought he threw the ball well and he was accurate on the deep ball,"" Alabama coach Nick Saban said of Jones. ""I know he missed one, but we just want to keep building on his confidence and our confidence in him that he's going to go out there and do his job well."" THE TAKEAWAY Western Carolina fell to 0-57 against FBS teams. The Catamounts came up empty after making it into Tide territory on each of their first four drives, including three turnovers. ""We had five turnovers on the day, and you can't do that against anybody, but especially the University of Alabama,"" Catamounts coach Mark Speir said. ""I wish them the best of luck in their quest for the playoffs."" Alabama did what it was supposed to and showed no signs of an emotional hangover after Tagovailoa's injury. The defense had some shaky moments but was missing several players nursing injuries, including linemen Raekwon Davis and D.J. Dale. Najee Harris ran for a touchdown and caught a scoring pass. TAULIA'S TURN Tagovailoa's absence gave his younger brother, Taulia, a chance for his most extended action. The freshman came into the game with 12:12 left in the third quarter and threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Smith on his first attempt. He completed 2 of 3 passes for 35 yards. Alabama scrapped plans to redshirt the four-star recruit, who already had played in four games. Fellow freshman quarterback Paul Tyson, great-grandson of coaching icon Bear Bryant, saw his first action. CARE TO DANCE? When Saban recruited safety Jared Mayden, he took part in a dancing contest. Mayden's mother, Katrina Salles, reminded him of that during the pre-game ceremony honoring the seniors on the field. ""She reminded me of that today and actually said, 'Do you want to dance?' I said, 'Not today,"" said Saban, laughing. PICKS IN PAIRS McKinney ended Western Carolina's first two drives with interceptions, including the pick-six, after coming in with just one. Mayden got his third and fourth interceptions. UP NEXT Western Carolina finished its regular season and must replace senior quarterback Adams. Alabama ends the regular season at No. 16 Auburn in its final chance to make a statement for the playoffs. ___ More AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and            http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25",['ENGLISH'],712,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-2FLUA7L6AZAXFFAOI6AUPO776A,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000126', 'className': 'ATHLETES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000081', 'className': 'AMERICAN FOOTBALL'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX001615', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001452', 'className': 'RANKINGS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DMYZ', 'className': 'EMOTIONS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST000D1MM', 'className': 'TUSCALOOSA, AL, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GS116', 'className': 'ALABAMA, USA'}]}"

11,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",PATRIOTS,,Breaking down Tom Brady's 'bad' season,,,"Link to Image Welcome to Tom Brady's terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year. This is not how the iconic quarterback envisioned his 20th season going. He's on a short contract, short of weapons, and short on patience for an offense that's just trying to stay out of the way instead of marching into the end zone. Instead of basking in the warm glow of a 9-1 start, Brady has been enveloped by a black hole of disappointment, culminating in last Sunday's perturbed presser following an anemic 17-10 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. The Patriots' lone touchdown came not from Brady's gilded arm but from Julian Edelman's - another indignity in a season that hasn't gone Brady's way. When you're used to the football universe bending to your will and your six Super Bowl rings it can be challenging to accept the alternative. Brady is 10 games into the season with an offense that isn't showing improvement. Rather, it seems to be regressing, failing to generate more than 20 points on its side of the ball in its last three games and generating fewer than 343 total yards in four straight games.","FULL TEXT On pace for his fewest TD passes in a full season as a starter, Brady has been relegated to the role of caretaker QB on a team riding a dominant defense. It might not get any easier on Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys with wide receivers Mohamed Sanu (ankle) and Phillip Dorsett (concussion) missing practice time and uncertain for the game. The good news is left tackle Isaiah Wynn should return to restore security to Brady's blindside. Still, at an age, 42, when Brady needs more assistance to play at an elite level - whether he'll admit it or not - he's getting less. The frustration of the GOAT is visible and palpable. ""I think the frustration that they see is that Tom knows what he has and what he doesn't have,"" said a source close to Brady. Brady is also reeling from the revolving door at wide receiver. He envisioned a receiving corps with Demaryius Thomas, Josh Gordon, and Antonio Brown. That never actually materialized. Thomas was traded to the Jets to make room for Brown. But now all three wideouts have run out routes from Foxborough, leaving Brady with an emptier nest than anticipated. The team acquired Sanu, but he's still trying to assimilate. Having Brown for one game was like getting a bite of Kobe beef and then having it yanked away and replaced with ground chuck named Jakobi Meyers and N'Keal Harry. It's tough for TBQB to swallow. To recap Brady's season of discontent: Aug. 5 - Brady discussed the revamped contract he received, which added $8 million to his 2019 salary but not any additional years: ""It is what it is. That's a good line. Whoever said it, it's very pertinent. Like I said, there's a lot of guys who have one year left on their contract. I've got one year to go, and we'll see what happens."" Sept. 20 - The Patriots release Brown after 11 tumultuous days, multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, and threatening text messages to one of his accusers. Sept. 29 - After a 16-10 win over the Buffalo Bills in which Brady threw the most passes in his career without reaching 200 yards or tossing a touchdown, going 18 for 39 for 150 yards and an interception, he is noticeably dejected. He opens his postgame presser with a sarcastic remark about ""that riveting performance."" Oct. 4 - Brady is asked about young players traditionally having a difficult time acclimating to the offense. He hardly offers a ringing endorsement. ""Like I said, I've got to do the best that I can do,"" said Brady. ""So, yeah, those guys are trying. They're young. I was young; I was trying once, too. I just didn't have to play my first year, so it's a little different."" Oct. 8 - Brady is asked in the wake of tight end Benjamin Watson's release - Watson would return to the team on Oct. 15 - about relying on tight ends Ryan Izzo and Matt LaCosse. ""I'm the quarterback, so I don't make those decisions,"" he said. ""Whoever is out there, that's who I've got to play with."" Oct. 19 -- Brady is hounded with questions about a cameo he had on the Netflix show ""Living with Yourself"" starring Paul Rudd. Some interpret Brady's scene coming out of a strip-mall spa that's central to the cloning premise of the show as trolling Patriots owner Robert Kraft. The Patriots patriarch was caught up in a sting operation at a seedy South Florida day spa and charged with two counts of misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution. ""That's not what that was about,"" Brady said. ""I think that was taken out of context, just like you're taking it out of context and trying to make a story for yourself which has a negative connotation to it, which I don't appreciate."" Nov. 17 - An irked Brady gives a truncated press conference in Philadelphia where he is visibly agitated by the state of the offense, which punted on eight of 13 possessions. If Brady has been striking more sour notes than usual this season, it echoes the unit he leads. The Patriots rank 16th out of 32 teams in yards per game (359.9). They sit 17th in third-down conversions (38.8 percent). They're 30th in rushing yards per attempt at 3.31 and 25th in red-zone touchdown percentage 48.8 percent, the latter two areas the team has struggled in all season. It's that lack of improvement, not a lack of statistics, that bugs Brady. He has proven time and time again he'll do whatever it takes to win, whether that's handing it off or airing it out. He was happy to do the former last season when the offense found its identity as a run-to-pass attack. But the inefficiency and constrictions of the offense are grating for the GOAT. The Patriots struggle to throw the ball consistently outside the numbers, allowing defenses to make the middle of the field claustrophobic. Harry can help there, but the rookie has to secure Brady's trust, and the football in practice, first. Forced to resort to game manager mode, Brady has faced unappetizing choices. He can either hold the ball and risk sacks or throw it away, damage his passer rating, and live to fight another play. According to pro-football-reference.com, Brady leads the NFL in throwaways with 26. Brady also leads the NFL in intentional grounding penalties with four. It's natural to ask if part of the offense's struggles have to do with slippage in Brady's game. The NFL average passer rating is 91.5 for 2019. Brady is at 90.1. But he's still throwing the ball with zip and placing it where he wants to, mostly. His play is a symptom of the offense's infirmity, not the cause. Brady's 2019 mien is incongruous with his career.

12,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,Morgan's 4 TD passes lead No. 11 Gophers past Wildcats 38-22,,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) - Tanner Morgan led No. 11 Minnesota to scores on its first three possessions and finished with four touchdown passes, and the Gophers bounced back from their first loss of the season with a 38-22 win over Northwestern on Saturday. The Gophers (10-1, 7-1 Big Ten, No. 10 CFP), who lost at Iowa last week, clinched a share of the West Division title and clinched their sixth season with 10 or more wins.","""The word of the week was respond,"" Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck said. ""We needed to and they responded. That was a clear message from the beginning, that we had to start fast. ""That's what championship football looks like - come out of the gate and put 21 points on the board like that."" Morgan, the Big Ten's leading passer, came out firing following a week in the concussion protocol after absorbing back-to-back sacks by the Hawkeyes. The redshirt sophomore, listed as questionable until Saturday morning, has thrown 26 touchdowns this season to set a school record. ""We knew we had to come out fast, come out firing,"" Morgan said. ""We always talk about starting fast, accelerating in the middle and finishing strong."" Fleck said Morgan was almost his old self, despite an abbreviated week of practice. ""Got to give him credit with the limited amount of reps he had to be able to play like he did,"" Fleck said. ""There were some things he was just a little off on today."" Morgan threw three TD passes to Rashod Bateman and one to Tyler Johnson against Northwestern (2-9, 0-8). Bateman finished with 78 receiving yards and Johnson had 125, giving Minnesota its first pair of 1,000-yard receivers in season. Rodney Smith finished with 77 rushing yards to give him 1,063 for the season. Morgan zipped a 19-yard TD pass to Bateman in the corner of the end zone to end a 10-play, 56-yard drive on Minnesota's first possession. After Shannon Brooks ran in from 9 yards, Morgan hit Bateman for a 10-yard TD and 21-0 lead. Bateman's other TD catch was a 7-yarder in the third quarter. With quarterback Aidan Smith sidelined (hand), Northwestern turned to Hunter Johnson, who hadn't started since the season opener. Andrew Marty entered early in the second quarter after Johnson went 0 for 2 and was sacked three times. Marty threw a TD pass to Jace James and ran for two scores. ""(Johnson) was the most healthy quarterback we had to start the game who had experience,"" Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said. ""When Hunter went down, it was Andrew's opportunity. ""He was pretty efficient, I'm just happy for him."" Joe Gaziano sacked Morgan for a safety early in the second quarter to get Northwestern on the board. Gaziano added another sack to give him 29 for his career, a school record. LUCKY 7? Minnesota has seven wins in Big Ten play for the first time, TAKEAWAY Minnesota: Morgan seems primed to lead Minnesota into the postseason. His third touchdown pass in the game eclipsed Adam Weber's season mark of 24 set in 2007. The Gophers have their first 10-plus win season since 2003. Minnesota's previous four seasons with 10 wins or more were in 1900, 1903, 1904 and 1905. This is Minnesota's first 10-win year in regular-season play since 1905. Northwestern: Since the Big Ten started playing a championship game in 2011, no team until 2019 Northwestern finished last in its division after playing in the title game the previous year. The Wildcats are in danger of going winless in conference play for the first time since the 1998 team went 0-8 in Gary Barnett's final season.

14,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",POLITICS,,New Hampshire may test durability of Sanders' popularity,,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image FRANKLIN, N.H. (AP) - Bernie Sanders has consistently remained among the front-runners in the Democratic primary with polling that has stayed strong despite his campaign-trail heart attack last month and the rise of top rivals Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg. But perhaps no state will test the Vermont senator's durability more than New Hampshire, where he trounced Hillary Clinton by 22 points in 2016 and now may find himself a victim of that success since repeating such a dominate performance seems unthinkable.","Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, is trying to erode Sanders' support among ardent progressives, while former Vice President Joe Biden continues to woo the Democratic establishment, declaring during a recent stop in the state capital, Concord: ""I plan on winning New Hampshire."" Yet another New Englander, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, could raise the state's stakes since he's already relatively well known here, despite  just joining the race. And, with none of those candidates from nearby states running away with New Hampshire, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has moved among the front-runners - similar to his rise in Iowa. ""I like what Bernie stands for,"" said Jessica Pine, 42, who attended a Sanders event Saturday in Franklin and is considering voting for him, Warren or Biden. ""I'm not sure about the electability for him."" Polls in late October and early November show Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg all bunched together for the New Hampshire lead, with each seeing about the same level of support from likely primary voters. Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in August he expected Sanders to win New Hampshire - which is expected to hold its primary on Feb. 11, eight days after Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses - while insisting that falling short wouldn't spell catastrophe. ""It gets harder if we don't win New Hampshire for sure,"" Shakir said. Still, in September, Sanders ousted his New Hampshire state director, and a top adviser to the campaign in the state also left. On Oct. 1, Sanders had a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada. Since then, the Sanders campaign has shown more of a New Hampshire presence and announced earlier this month that it had 90 staffers here. Warren has more than 55 staffers statewide, according to a campaign aide. And, though voters at their respective events often name Sanders or Warren as among their top choices, the senators' campaign styles are far different. Warren prides herself on the number of ""selfies"" she takes with attendees, with lines snaking throughout venues well after she's finished speaking. Sanders sometimes moves on quickly enough that staffers begin breaking down the site moments after his event concludes - though he held a photo line of his own in Franklin on Saturday. Warren takes questions from the audience via a lottery system. Sanders - when he does opt to take questions - is likely to pepper crowds with more questions even as he provides answers. Sarah Gellert, a 40-year-old teacher, said she voted for Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary but now is undecided between him and Warren. ""I feel for both candidates very deeply and I would love - of course in this la la land world - I'd love to see them on the same ticket,"" Gellert said. ""I'm really scared for them because they have so much overlap in terms of their voter pool."" As he has elsewhere, Buttigieg has relied on his New Hampshire popularity rising even while still introducing himself to many voters and building out campaign infrastructure. Patrick makes the field even more crowded, but potentially helping to ease some of the logjam is California Sen. Kamala Harris, who spent weeks attracting large New Hampshire crowds only to recently close down her operations here to focus on Iowa. In Franklin, 75-year-old Sanders supporter Lana Kangas asked the senator if in the future he would take more time to show the differences between himself and the other candidates, including Warren. Sanders noted his age, 78 compared to Warren's 70, experience and consistency, but answered, ""I will say without hesitancy that every single Democratic candidate on his or her worst day will be 10 times better"" than President Donald Trump. After waiting to get her photo taken with Sanders, Kangas said she's worried the other Democrats couldn't beat Trump. ""I believe that Bernie is the only one that can galvanize the people, that will rally the people,"" Kangas said. ""Sen. Warren, I believe, will end up like (former President Barack) Obama. He said all the right things, he was for change, he was going to galvanize people to fight for change and when he came into office, he didn't. It was like the whole thing got dropped.""",['ENGLISH'],794,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-OX444FK5XJFHZKRKQ5RHCXPOEY,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001812', 'className': 'VOTERS & VOTING'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000265', 'className': 'CAUCUSES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009TRZ', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001377', 'className': 'PRIMARY ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'STX001970', 'className': 'TRENDS & EVENTS'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009UB9', 'className': 'BERNIE SANDERS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DNV1', 'className': 'PETE BUTTIGIEG'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DANS', 'className': 'ELIZABETH WARREN'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJO', 'className': 'HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJK', 'className': 'JOE BIDEN'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'PE0009U67', 'className': 'DEVAL PATRICK'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX576', 'className': 'CONCORD, NH, USA'}, {'score': '54', 'classCode': 'ST000D24T', 'className': 'SOUTH BEND, IN, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'GS145', 'className': 'NEW HAMPSHIRE, USA'}, {'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GR214', 'className': 'NORTHEAST USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS130', 'className': 'INDIANA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS144', 'className': 'NEVADA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS161', 'className': 'VERMONT, USA'}]}"
15,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,Harvard-Yale game delayed at halftime by student protest,,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Protesters wearing the colors of both Harvard and Yale staged a sit-in at midfield of Yale Bowl during halftime of the 136th edition of the annual football rivalry known as The Game. Most left after about an hour when they were escorted off by police; about two dozen who remained were told by police they were under arrest. A few dozen protesters initially trickled onto the field as the Yale band finished performing its halftime routine. They held up banners asking the schools' presidents to divest from the fossil fuel industry, while other signs raised issues of Puerto Rican debt and the treatment of the Uighurs.","Largely of college age but with a few older protesters mixed in, the group chanted: ""Hey Hey! Ho Ho! Fossil fuels have got to go!"" One banner read ""This is an emergency."" In a statement distributed to reporters in the press box during the fourth quarter, Yale said it ""stands firmly for the right to free expression."" ""While I respect the rights of Harvard and Yale students to protest, their efforts should not impact their fellow students' ability to pursue their passions as athletes on the field of play, and those who support them,"" Yale athletic director Vicky Chun said. ""We are proud of our student-athletes and coaches for their resilience today in an extremely difficult situation."" Police in yellow vests lined up alongside the sit-in but did not intervene. When the 15-minute halftime expired and the protest continued, hundreds more fans streamed onto the field to join in. Fans remaining in the stands began to boo, but only briefly. Players tried to remain warm on the sideline in the mid-40 temperatures, but then returned to their locker rooms. Harvard coach Tim Murphy was given an update from the game officials and public safety officers as the protest continued. The public address announcer implored the group to leave, repeating, ""As a courtesy to both teams, the game must resume."" Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins spoke to the protesters over a megaphone, trying to convince them that they had made their point, but it would be lost if the situation escalated. After about an hour, police formed a line and moved forward, from the Yale sideline toward the Harvard sideline. A protest leader encouraged all ""internationals"" to leave. An agreement was reached to escort the remainders off, with one police officer to every two protesters. Those who did not leave then were informed by Higgins that they would be arrested. Asked how many people were taken into custody, Higgins referred questions to the police public information officer. Messages left with Yale and New Haven police were not immediately returned. Between 20 and 30 protesters were arrested, according to organizers of the event. Rachel Sadoff, a junior at Harvard, said about 150 students from the two universities planned to participate in the protest. She said about 100 more students who had been sitting in the stands joined in. ""Our goal was to spread the word,"" Sadoff said. ""If more people speak up, our colleges will have to listen."" She said those arrested were released and given a court date. With Yale hoping to clinch an Ivy League title, Harvard led 15-3 at halftime and opened a 29-19 lead after three quarters. The Crimson led 36-22 with about seven minutes left in the game, and most of the 44,989 in the announced crowd had left. Yale rallied with two touchdowns in the final 88 seconds to force overtime in the game, which started at noon and was still going when the sun set in New Haven at 4:26 p.m. The Yale Bowl does not have lights. ___ More AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and            http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25",['ENGLISH'],628,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-LNLNWIGPZJAOVASOWJOGHHD6YU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001615', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'N922120QM', 'className': 'POLICE FORCES'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzBBQzFGOUQ2NzlGNDMzMUEwQ0IxNTdDOTNFQ0Y2QjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Intercollegiate & Interscholastic Athletics'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000DHVB', 'className': 'SPORTS OFFICIATING'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000126', 'className': 'ATHLETES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000644', 'className': 'COACHES & TRAINERS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg', 'className': 'Freedom of Speech'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODVCRjhDNURBRDYzNDAzNjlFMDA3ODgyMUQ0ODhDRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkzMEJFRkNCRUQwNEIyOEE3QTBDOEFFM0ZDRDg0NzU', 'className': 'Arrests'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001066', 'className': 'MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001963', 'className': 'SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEM2NUFFNTAyOTEwNDdBQkE4MTJFMDM1QTdCNzBCNTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE', 'className': 'Expressive Conduct'}], 'city': [{'score': '57', 'classCode': 'ST000D1KC', 'className': 'NEW HAVEN, CT, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '72', 'classCode': 'GS122', 'className': 'CONNECTICUT, USA'}]}"

She was 95. She died Saturday in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The cause was dementia, her family said. Long beat three competitors with 56% of the vote in 1985, with a 2-1 margin over the second-place finisher for the seat held for a total of 16 years by Gillis Long. The district covered 15 central Louisiana parishes, including Baton Rouge, the state capital.","""It was a challenging time. She had two weeks to decide whether or not to run for his seat,"" her son George Long, who was 30 at the time, said in a phone interview Saturday. ""Our dad had just died, and people were giving her campaign contributions,"" said his sister, Janis Long. She said U.S. Rep. Lindy Boggs, D-La, who had won her husband's seat after his plane disappeared in Alaska in 1972, encouraged Cathy Long to run. Gillis Long was first elected to Congress in 1962 and then lost in the next election before being voted back into office in 1972, holding the seat for seven straight terms. Cathy Long already had experience in politics, working early on for a U.S. senator from Oregon and a U.S. representative from Ohio, and later campaigning and giving speeches for her husband, as well as advising him. ""I don't have to start from scratch. I already know how Congress works,"" she told The Associated Press in 1985. George Long described her as one of the last moderates elected from the area. ""I was glad she decided not to run for re-election,"" he said. ""The tide was turning."" Mary Catherine Small was born in Dayton, Ohio. She joined the Navy at age 20 during World War II, serving at a Navy hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas. The Longs met at Louisiana State University, where both enrolled after the war. They married in 1947. George Long noted that one of their mother's early campaign experiences was riding around the state with former Gov. Earl K. Long - her husband's cousin - while he was running for Congress. Earl Long won a Democratic primary runoff and was preparing to run unopposed in the general election when he died in 1960. His death prompted Gillis Long to move the family back to Louisiana to establish residency so he could run for the seat in 1962, George Long said. Cathy Long also campaigned for the Equal Rights Amendment, her children said. The siblings recalled their mother as an adventurous spirit who loved scuba diving, fishing trips and even tried parasailing when she was about 60. She also was a giving person who worked in the 1960s to promote the Special Olympics and more recently fed homeless people and tutored reading at a Washington, D.C., neighborhood organization called Miriam's Kitchen, they said. Janis Long said her mother asked for 90th birthday gifts of donations to Miriam's Kitchen, which received about $12,000. The family said in their obituary that they plan to ""cast ashes into the Potomac River on Easter, in the Mississippi River on Mardi Gras, and in the Caribbean Sea near San Pedro, Belize where she loved to fish and scuba dive.""

But a second-half goal by Maggie Fitzgerald was the difference. The senior forward scored in the 63rd minute for a two-goal cushion and the Panthers held on to defeat defending champion Winchester, 3-2, at Worcester State, for the program's first championship, the capper to a 19-0-3 season.","FULL TEXT It was fitting that Fitzgerald netted the winner. After playing on the junior varsity as a freshman, and playing in just a couple of varsity games in the past two seasons, she was voted a captain this year for ""how she puts the team first, and what a great leader she is,"" said Holliston coach Brielle Chadsey. With the expanded role and playing time, Fitzgerald's four years of commitment to the team paid off with a 10-goal season and a championship medal. ""To come out as a captain my senior year and be a contributor to the team is amazing because I feel like I proved myself,"" Fitzgerald said. ""I can put my soccer career aside and show that I could have done it any year."" Holliston opened the scoring in the 15th minute when junior forward Megan Putvinski beat the Winchester defense down the right flank. The Panthers took a commanding 2-0 lead to halftime thanks to a shot from in close by sophomore midfielder Mia Luisi. Winchester (17-2-3) pushed back in the second half, though, with junior Ally Murphy scoring in the first 10 minutes on a header. Fitzgerald made her mark in the 63rd minute. After a header by Putvinski bounced off the post, she was in the right spot to knock it in with her left foot. ""I just stuck my leg out and sometimes that's all you have to do,"" Fitzgerald said.

18,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",WORLD,,"Who needs canvas? In Dakar, street artists express their visions on sides of homes",,,"Link to Image DAKAR, Senegal - On one wall, the painting of a marabout, a Muslim holy man, peers out from behind a line hung with laundry. Nearby, a poster of an African woman in a bustle has been pasted to a house. Still further along, women socialize in front of a wall covered in an intricate black-and-white abstract pattern. These are the painted houses of the Médina, a poor and working-class neighborhood near downtown Dakar. The neighborhood has welcomed street artists from all over the world to practice their craft in what the founder of the project calls the open sky museum. Dozens of wall paintings dot the neighborhood, bringing color to usually drab cement walls and adding to the flourishing international art scene in Dakar.","FULL TEXT Artists from not just Senegal but Burkina Faso, Algeria, Morocco, Congo, France, and Italy have come to paint on these walls. They in turn have brought art lovers and tourists into a neighborhood where they otherwise might not go, to mingle with people they otherwise might not meet. The wall art of the Médina ""can bring together people who normally don't even see each other,"" said Mauro Petroni, a ceramist who has lived in Dakar for many years. Street art seems to come naturally to Senegal, where many small shops are adorned with images of what they sell. Paintings of scissors signify tailors; heads with fancy hairstyles advertise barbers; images of cows and bowls of milk herald the ubiquitous sweet milk shops; a drawing of a sheep broadcasts the presence of a vendor serving grilled meat. Shop art is commissioned by shop owners and sometimes painted by them, too. But to paint on a house in the Médina neighborhood, it helps to go through Mamadou Boye Diallo, known as Modboye. Diallo, 31, was born and raised in the Médina, the son of an elevator operator. He dropped out of school at 15 to become a break dancer and rollerblader. He got to know the art scene by working as a messenger, delivering fliers on roller blades for art galleries. In 2010, he created Yataal Art, a nonprofit arts collective, and painted the first wall in the Médina with friends. The beauty of it is that ""you don't have to take a nice shower and wear perfume"" to see the art, Diallo said. Among street artists seeking a wall to paint on, Diallo became the man to see. ""You have to pass by him in order to work in the Médina,"" said one of the street artists, Doline Legrand Diop. ""He functions a bit like a curator."" Legrand Diop lived in Dakar for many years and has two children with a Senegalese man, though she now lives in France. Her pictures of black people dressed as aristocrats, her #remakehistory project, can be seen on the walls of the Médina. In the beginning, it was not always easy to convince homeowners to let people paint on their walls. ""They wanted money,"" Diallo said. But as the project caught on, they wanted to keep up with their neighbors. ""It's for the community,"" said Tonton Kaba, a retired chauffeur who has a Legrand Diop collage on his house. Abdoulaye Camara, known as Père Djim, allowed an artist to paint the word ""suba,"" Wolof for tomorrow, on his house. He makes furniture of wood and animal horns on the street in the Médina, home to many artisans, so he could relate. Still, what residents expect and what artists deliver are not always the same thing. Giacomo Bufarini, an Italian artist who goes by the art name Run, painted the wall of a house with a giant silhouette of the woman who lived there. He incorporated a window into her head, like a window into her mind. Rather than being impressed by the concept, she complained that he had left the peeling paint on the window frame. ""I told her I'm not like a decorator,"" Bufarini recalled, sounding both peeved and guilty. Another artist, Ernesto Novo, had to tiptoe around a large bull while he painted a row of African statuettes onto a wall last March. The animal is still there (as is the art). The spirit of the open sky gallery is improvisational, just like the lives of many of the artists. Traveling through West Africa from France, an artist called the Wa, who would not give his real name, wound up in Senegal by accident after his visa expired in Mauritania, and he and his friends drove to Senegal ""for a beer."" Bufarini recalled that after finishing his painting, he, Diallo, and friends celebrated by going for a fish barbecue on the beach. Having no barbecue, they cooked on refrigerator racks scavenged from the trash, after burning off the plastic coating. The painted-houses project has gotten so big that this year, Delphine Buysse, a Belgian curator, has arranged for artists in residence to live at a luxury hotel in Dakar, the Pullman, for a week, while painting in the Médina. One of the most recent wall paintings was a collaboration between Kouka Ntadi, a Congolese-French artist, and Barkinado Bocoum, a Senegalese artist. Ntadi painted abstract portraits in black and white, and Bocoum added folksier portraits in bright colors. Ntadi loved sharing the neighborhood with the commercial artists of the barbershops and milk stores. ""I would say there is not really a border between the two in Africa,"" he said. ""It's not like in France or the US where there is a snobbism about art, and you can't be in marketing. So for sure, we can still be an artist and make a design for a bottle of milk or a side of beef.""",['ENGLISH'],919,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-E5W5UFQOHII6VK2QUEAUNBWRKU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001366', 'className': 'PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000CZUT', 'className': 'STREET ART'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009UKP', 'className': 'PAINTING'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0008XAA', 'className': 'VISUAL ARTISTS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000D8ZU', 'className': 'DANCERS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001220', 'className': 'NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001449', 'className': 'ROLLERBLADING & ROLLERSKATING'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'ST00099LR', 'className': 'MUSLIMS & ISLAM'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009VC0', 'className': 'ARTISTS & PERFORMERS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA2Q0M0NzJERDUwNDE0OEE2QjYzQTc0NUFFRDJFMjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Museums'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0008XAA', 'className': 'VISUAL ARTISTS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000D8ZU', 'className': 'DANCERS'}], 'city': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GX286', 'className': 'DAKAR, SENEGAL'}], 'country': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GC555', 'className': 'SENEGAL'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GC521', 'className': 'BURKINA FASO'}, {'score': '57', 'classCode': 'GC360', 'className': 'MOROCCO'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'GC317', 'className': 'FRANCE'}]}"
19,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,5 states resisting creation of panels to promote the census,,,"Link to Image ORLANDO - With billions in federal aid and seats in Congress at stake, some states are dragging their feet in carrying out one of the Census Bureau's chief recommendations for making sure everyone is counted during the 2020 census. Five states - Florida, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Texas - have not set up ""complete count committees"" that would create public awareness campaigns to encourage people to fill out the questionnaires.","FULL TEXT In some of those states, politicians argued that a statewide body would be unnecessary, since local committees, cities, and nonprofit organizations are already working to publicize the census. In others, state leaders didn't see any urgency to act. The once-a-decade count of the US population starts in January in a remote area of Alaska. The rest of the nation takes part starting in the spring. ""We are encouraging others to join in,"" Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham said this month. ""The clock is ticking, and the time to join is now."" Six states - Iowa, Maine, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin - only got on board in the past several weeks. Officials say the committees can separate census winners from losers. ""Complete count committees are extremely effective,"" said Albert Fontenot, an associate director at the Census Bureau. ""It's in the states' interests in that they get a funding flow and congressional seats."" Of the holdout states, all but Louisiana have Republican governors. In Texas, a measure to create a committee died in the GOP-dominated Legislature earlier this year even though the second most populous state has the most to gain from the census - up to three congressional seats. Some Texas lawmakers were worried about losing their seats during redistricting if population surges favoring Democrats were found in urban and suburban areas, said Luis Figueroa, legislative and policy director at the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin. Also, at the time, the Trump administration was pushing to add a citizenship question to the form, and some lawmakers didn't want to take a stand on the issue by promoting the census, he said. The US Supreme Court later blocked the question. Twenty-six state governments are appropriating nearly $350 million to reach people and get them to respond to the census. The amounts range from California's record $187 million to Montana's $100,000, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. New York City is committing $40 million. States led by Democrats have spent more per capita. Of the 11 states spending at least $1 per resident, all but North Dakota have Democratic governors, according to an Associated Press analysis. California, which stands to lose a seat in Congress, is spending $4.73 per person, using the money to target certain ethnic communities, provide educational materials to schools, and identify community leaders who can personally encourage participation in the most populous state. Spending on outreach offers a great return on investment, said Ditas Katague, director of the California Complete Count-Census 2020 Office. ""You have to look at how many programs will suffer and how much money we will lose,"" Katague said. In 2000, when California spent $24 million, 76 percent of residents returned the questionnaires by mail, outstripping the national average. In 2010, in the aftermath of the recession and budget cuts, California spent only $2 million, and the mail response rate dropped to 73 percent, below the national average. In Florida, the third most populous state, bills establishing a statewide committee died in the GOP-controlled legislature. With an influx from such places as Puerto Rico and Venezuela, Florida has gained about 2.5 million people since 2010 and could pick up two more congressional seats. A spokeswoman for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said he is still reviewing what action should be taken to help get a full head count. ""The governor takes the census seriously,"" spokeswoman Helen Ferre said. In Nebraska, Republican Governor Pete Ricketts vetoed a bill to create a complete count committee, saying that local committees are already doing the work and that the legislation would have given a University of Nebraska program authority to create the panel without guidance from the state. The number of congressional seats for Nebraska is expected to remain unchanged. Still, ""ultimately I think this will be a loss for Nebraska, especially in terms of receiving federal funds,"" said state Senator Matt Hansen, a Democrat from Lincoln who sponsored the legislation. ""Specifically, I am concerned children, racial and ethnic minority populations, homeless persons, and those who live in rural and isolated areas will be undercounted.""",['ENGLISH'],828,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-TB2OKNQOEMI6VK2QUEAUNBWRKU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MURBRjc1MUQxNkZENDVBREFCRTZGMTQxRUNENzMyNkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDEwQTI5QTZCNDQ4NEM2MUI3NTM4MUYzMDgyRDQwQzE', 'className': 'Census'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0009TD5', 'className': 'US REPUBLICAN PARTY'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DMVR', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT STATISTICS AGENCIES'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001960', 'className': 'PUBLIC POLICY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001220', 'className': 'NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001459', 'className': 'REDISTRICTING'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000971D', 'className': 'POPULATION SIZE'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000A7IS', 'className': 'ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCX', 'className': 'US DEMOCRATIC PARTY'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9C', 'className': 'GOVERNORS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST0009ZVD', 'className': 'SUPREME COURTS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001645', 'className': 'SUBURBS'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX590', 'className': 'AUSTIN, TX, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GS159', 'className': 'TEXAS, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS135', 'className': 'MAINE, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS143', 'className': 'NEBRASKA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS117', 'className': 'ALASKA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS125', 'className': 'FLORIDA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
20,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,NFL This Week: 49ers-Packers square off to highlight Week 12,,,"Link to Image Link to Image Jimmy Garoppolo and the San Francisco 49ers refuse to look too far ahead on their schedule. Especially this week while staring at a showdown with Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers. The thing is, though, this matchup could go a long way in helping determine the teams' seeding when the playoffs start. So, this one Sunday night at Levi's Stadium will have a bit of a postseason feel for both the 49ers (9-1) and Packers (8-2). ""With the (49ers) faithful and everything, having them helping out the defense and just getting the place rocking will be huge,"" Garoppolo said. ""The louder they can be, the better. But, yeah, it'll be a big game Sunday. ""This is a great opportunity, great challenge for us.""","It's also the highlight of a Week 12 slate of games on the NFL schedule. San Francisco begins a three-game stretch against teams currently in first place - and all with 8-2 records - including Green Bay, Baltimore and New Orleans. ""I don't even think about playoff seeding right now,"" 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. ""Our goal is to get in the playoffs. We're all right there. There's still a lot of football left. Each game we win, we've got a better chance at getting in there. You don't think about seeds, at least I don't, until you can narrow it down to one or two games. I think we're far from that right now."" The 49ers showed some resilience last week, rallying from 16 points down to beat Arizona for the team's biggest regular-season comeback since 2011. Meanwhile, the Packers are coming off a 24-16 victory over Carolina at home, giving them five wins in their past six games. ""We've been finding a way to win, different ways,"" Rodgers said. ""I think great teams understand their roles and embrace them and make it more about the team."" And, Green Bay is no stranger to playing in front of big TV audiences: The Packers are 3-1 in prime-time games this season. Week 12 started with Houston's 20-17 home victory over Indianapolis. Deshaun Watson threw two touchdown passes to DeAndre Hopkins and finished with 298 yards to help the Texans take the AFC South lead. Houston (7-4) rebounded from a 41-7 loss to Baltimore on Sunday. The Colts dropped to 6-5. Arizona (3-7-1), Minnesota (8-3), Kansas City (7-4) and the Los Angeles Chargers (4-7) are the final teams this season to take their bye-week breaks. BALTIMORE (8-2) at LOS ANGELES RAMS (6-4) Lamar Jackson and the Ravens play in LA on Monday night on a six-game winning streak, the longest active run in the NFL and the team's best since 2000 - when they won Super Bowl. Baltimore has done it mostly in dominant fashion, too, having won four in a row by 14 points or more. Jared Goff and the Rams have won three of four to stay in the NFC playoff race. Los Angeles will also see a familiar face: Ravens cornerback Marcus Peters was acquired in a trade with the Rams on Oct. 15 and has returned two interceptions for touchdowns while with Baltimore. DALLAS (6-4) at NEW ENGLAND (9-1) The Cowboys have the NFL's top-ranked offense, and the Patriots are ranked No. 1 in defense. So, something's got to give, right? Dallas' Dak Prescott leads the league with 322.1 passing yards per game and is on pace to be the first Cowboys QB to top the NFL in yards passing for a full season. He also has 38 wins since entering the NFL in 2016, second most in the league during that span behind - yep, you guessed it: the Patriots' Tom Brady. With a win Sunday, New England would extend its streak to 17 consecutive seasons with at least 10 wins - which would be an NFL record. SEATTLE (8-2) at PHILADELPHIA (5-5) This matchup is highlighted by streaking quarterbacks, with the Seahawks' Russell Wilson and Eagles' Carson Wentz each having thrown at least one touchdown pass in 13 consecutive regular-season games, the longest active run in the NFL. Wilson is looking to improve to 4-0 in his career against the Eagles. And, Seattle has been terrific on the road, going 5-0 so far away from home. Wentz and the Eagles are struggling on offense right now and are coming off a 17-10 loss to New England last week. CAROLINA (5-5) at NEW ORLEANS (8-2) Christian McCaffrey has been a huge bright spot in what has been an up-and-down season in Carolina. The Panthers running back is the first NFL player with at least 1,000 yards rushing and 500 yards receiving in his team's first 10 games of season. He has also eclipsed 140 scrimmage yards in each of past four games - although Carolina is 1-3 in those. New Orleans also has a record-breaking star on offense in wide receiver Michael Thomas, who leads the league with 94 receptions, the most by a player in the first 10 games of a season in NFL history. He's also the first player with 90-plus receptions in each of his first four seasons. JACKSONVILLE (4-6) at TENNESSEE (5-5) The Jaguars are looking to sweep the Titans for the first time since 2005 after Jacksonville made things miserable for then-Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota, who was sacked nine times in the 20-7 loss in Week 3. Ryan Tannehill is under center this time around for the Titans and has three-game winning drives in four starts. He has also been solid at home, where he has a 100 or higher passer rating in three games. Nick Foles is Jacksonville's quarterback for this meeting after Gardner Minshew played in his place while he sat out because of injury. Foles threw for 296 yards and two TDs with one interception in a 33-13 loss to Indianapolis, his first start since the opener. DENVER (3-7) at BUFFALO (7-3) The Bills are off to their best start after 10 games in 20 years, and the play of Josh Allen has been a big reason. Buffalo's second-year quarterback earned AFC offensive player of week honors after going 21 of 33 for 256 yards and three touchdowns passing and one rushing in a 37-20 win over Miami. Allen also has 163 pass attempts without an interception, dating to a 14-7 win at Tennessee in Week 6. The Broncos have been deadly - to themselves - late in games, having squandered four fourth-quarter leads. The latest was a doozy as Denver became the first team in five years to blow a 20-point first-half lead in a 27-23 loss to Minnesota last Sunday. It all has John Elway's Broncos in jeopardy of a second 3-8 record in three years. TAMPA BAY (3-7) at ATLANTA (3-7) The Falcons have won the past five meetings between the NFC South rivals, with the Buccaneers' previous victory coming over three years ago. Atlanta enters this matchup having won two in a row overall after starting the season 1-7. Meanwhile, Tampa Bay has lost five of its past six. What does it all mean? Well, the loser in this one will fall into sole possession of last place in the division. Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston leads the NFL with 22 turnovers, including a league-high 18 interceptions. He'll face a Falcons defense that had four interceptions in a win over Carolina. OAKLAND (6-4) at NEW YORK JETS (3-7) The Raiders are coming off having swept a three-game homestand for the first time since 1980. Now, they hit the road, where they're 1-3 this season. Oakland rookie running back Josh Jacobs has three 100-yard performances and ranks fourth in the NFL in rushing with 923 yards. He'll face a tough test in this one against a Jets defense that is allowing a league-low 79.1 yards rushing per game. Sam Darnold and the Jets have won two in a row, coming against the lowly Giants and Redskins. Now, New York looks to win three straight for the first time since Weeks 3-5 of the 2017 season - yes, over two years ago. MIAMI (2-8) at CLEVELAND (4-6) Both teams welcome playing a game after a turbulent week for each. The Dolphins released suspended running back Mark Walton after his arrest on charges of punching his pregnant girlfriend. Meanwhile, the Browns are dealing with the fallout from Myles Garrett's suspension for clobbering Pittsburgh's Mason Rudolph with the quarterback's helmet. Miami had its two-game winning streak end last week against Buffalo, and has been outscored by a league-worst 166 points while ranking last in turnover differential (minus-13) and takeaways (seven). Cleveland is creeping back toward the playoff picture after a slow start with two straight home wins. The Browns have helped themselves by not committing a turnover in their past three games. NEW YORK GIANTS (2-8) at CHICAGO (4-6) The Giants come off their bye-week break having dropped six straight and would clinch a third losing season in row with a loss. Saquon Barkley has struggled since returning from a high ankle sprain more than a month ago. Barkley has carried 64 times for 165 yards, an average of 2.57 yards, in four games against Arizona, Detroit, Dallas and the Jets - against whom he gained a career-worst 1 yard on 13 carries. Chicago has lost five of six, despite holding opponents under 20 points in three of the past four games. The problem has been on offense as the Bears rank 28th in scoring and 27th in touchdowns. DETROIT (3-6-1) at WASHINGTON (1-9) The Lions have dropped three in row for the third time under second-year coach Matt Patricia. It appears Detroit might have to try to snap the skid without quarterback Matthew Stafford, who's expected to miss his third consecutive game with a back injury. So, it's up to Jeff Driskel, who has three touchdowns and one interception this season in Stafford's place. The Redskins have lost four in a row overall, and nine straight at home, dating to last season. Rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins, sacked six times last week against the Jets, is expected to make his third NFL start. PITTSBURGH (5-5) at CINCINNATI (0-10) The Steelers will be short-handed in this one as they'll be without center Maurkice Pouncey, who's serving a suspension for his role in the brawl at the end of Pittsburgh's loss to Cleveland last week. Injured running back James Conner (shoulder) and wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster (concussion/knee) are also expected to miss the game. The Steelers have this going for them: They've won nine straight in the series, 12 of 13 and 17 of 20. Oh, and there's also the fact the Bengals are the only winless team in the NFL and have matched the worst start in club history and its longest losing streak. ___ More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and            https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",['ENGLISH'],1703,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-ECYFVEBYOJAFBAQWNXFHSXCOXI,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Business & Corporate Compliance', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000081', 'className': 'AMERICAN FOOTBALL'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001615', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST0009SE3', 'className': 'STADIUMS & ARENAS'}], 'person': [{'score': '77', 'classCode': 'PE000DJSY', 'className': 'AARON RODGERS'}]}"
21,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,Kim clings to 1-shot lead with $1.5 million on the line,,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image NAPLES, Fla. (AP) - Sei Young Kim was on the verge of taking all the drama out of the chase for the richest payoff in women's golf history. She opened with three birdies in seven holes Saturday in the CME Group Tour Championship as her challengers either stalled or faded. She led by five shots before making the turn.","Kim hit the brakes. Nelly Korda hit the gas. When the third round ended at Tiburon Golf Club, Kim had to settle for a 4-under 68 and a one-shot lead over Korda with one round remaining to see who wins the $1.5 million. Both made it sound as though it will be just another round of golf. Then again, no one in LPGA Tour history has ever played for this much cash. It's more than either of them has made all year. ""I had a pretty solid round front nine,"" Kim said. ""But back nine was little tough to focus. I kept thinking about future, so I was like, 'Nope, Sei Young. Stop thinking. Focus on it.' I had a lot of chances back nine. Going to practice and ready for tomorrow."" Korda, who has a chance to reach No. 2 in the women's world ranking with a victory, fell back early with a double bogey by going long of the green on the par-3 fourth. She recovered with three birdies over the next five holes, and then really turned it on. ""Kind of hit the brakes every single day on the back nine,"" Korda said. ""I told myself to be really aggressive on the back nine, and it worked out today."" She opened with three straight birdies, holing out from a greenside bunker on No. 11, and she was back in the game. Korda shot a 31 on the back nine for a 66. Kim was at 16-under 200 and will be in the final group with Korda. Caroline Masson of Germany, who will join them in the final pairing, had a 70 and was four shots behind, with Charley Hull of England another shot behind after a 66. For so many others, an ideal day for scoring at Tiburon turned out to be a lost opportunity. Brooke Henderson of Canada, who attracted the biggest gallery playing with Korda and with a horde of Canadians in Florida for the winter, had bogeys on three of the par 5s and never got anything going for a 71. She was six shots behind. Defending champion Lexi Thompson made an early charge, only to be slowed by a pair of bogeys on the back - all her bogeys this week have been on the back nine - that gave her a 70 and put her seven shots behind. Kim has shown few signs of coming back to the field. She has made only one bogey through 54 holes, and with her strong start it looked as though the 26-year-old Korean might run away from the field. The back nine changed everything. Korda appeared to be in trouble on No. 11 when she fanned a shot from the waste area into a bunker. She blasted it out and watched the ball crash into the pin and drop for birdie. She made another at the par-3 12th and took advantage at the end with a 4-hybrid on the green at the par-5 17th for at two-putt birdie. Kim gave herself plenty of reasonable looks at birdie on the back nine. She couldn't get any to fall except for a 25-footer on the 15th hole that restored her lead to two shots, but only briefly. Kim's second shot into the 17th was well short and to the right into a bunker, and she blasted out to some 30 feet away. She played away from the flag on the 18th and two-putted for par from about 40 feet. Still, she was in the lead after the third straight day, one step closer to a massive payoff. The format changed this year from a points-based system in which only the top 12 players had a shot at a $1 million bonus to any of the 60 players who made it to the Tour Championship getting $1.5 million in official money by winning the tournament. Jin Young Ko, celebrated Thursday night as LPGA player of the year, tried to get back into the game with a 66. She still was six shots behind along with Jessica Korda (69), the older sister of Nelly Korda. Ko is virtually a lock to win the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average and needs a 65 to become only the second woman to finish with a sub-69 average score for the year. ___ For more AP golf coverage: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and            https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",['ENGLISH'],693,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-36UB6OKPBNAA5CH6KN6XZIOPJM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000800', 'className': 'GOLF'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX001407', 'className': 'PROFESSIONAL SPORTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000A2IA', 'className': 'GOLF TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX001452', 'className': 'RANKINGS'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST000D2C2', 'className': 'NAPLES, FL, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GS125', 'className': 'FLORIDA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '84', 'classCode': 'GC339', 'className': 'CANADA'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GC318', 'className': 'GERMANY'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'GC628', 'className': 'ENGLAND'}]}"
22,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",WORLD,,Prince Andrew's friendship with Epstein joins a list of royal scandals,,,"LONDON - The British monarchy has survived public crises before - religious schisms, revolutions, murderous kings - but this week the royal family scrambled to confront a relatively new opponent: the embarrassing televised interview. The Duke of York, better known as Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, struggled to defend himself during a 50-minute interview with the BBC as he talked about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier accused of sex trafficking. His interview, widely criticized in the British press as disastrous after it was broadcast last weekend, catapulted a long-simmering controversy into a full-blown scandal for the royal family, among the worst in its modern history.","FULL TEXT Reacting to the backlash, the prince announced Wednesday that he was indefinitely stepping away from public life, with permission from the queen. But over the past century, a number of scandals have rattled the British royal family. Andrew's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein The prince's relationship with Epstein, whom he met in 1999, has been under scrutiny for years. In the BBC interview, the prince said he had attended dinner parties in which Epstein hosted ""cosmopolitan"" figures from politics, academia, and business, and the men visited each other's homes several times. But Andrew said he had seen ""no indication"" of wrongdoing by Epstein at the time. In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution, and served 13 months in a Florida county jail under a widely criticized plea deal. After his release in 2010, Andrew stayed at Epstein's Manhattan mansion and was widely criticized for continuing the relationship. This summer, after the financier was arrested on federal charges and details of allegations against him began to emerge, attention again turned to Andrew's friendship. In August, Epstein killed himself in a New York jail. One of his accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, said that Epstein had trafficked her to Andrew, and that the prince had sex with her three times, an accusation that he denies. As pressure mounted, the prince agreed to the BBC interview. But the response to the broadcast was immediate and vocal, especially around what appeared to be the prince's lack of sympathy for Epstein's victims. Businesses and organizations associated with the prince quickly distanced themselves from him. Charles and Diana's failed marriage Andrew was not the first royal of his generation to find himself under fire after a televised interview. His older brother, Prince Charles, in an effort to win back popularity after separating from his first wife, Diana, agreed to appear in a 1994 documentary. But when the prince confessed to adultery, he immediately lost the good will he had been desperately trying to rebuild. Their father, Prince Philip, said at the time that he did not understand why his son would air his troubles in public, but the interview had been approved in advance by the queen. A year later, Princess Diana said in an interview that ""there were three of us in this marriage,"" referring to Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles, who later became his second wife. Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after years of separation. The next year, after Diana died in a car accident in Paris while being followed by the paparazzi, the royal family came under fire for appearing to be ""indifferent to the country's sorrow."" Princess Margaret's love life Two decades before Charles's divorce, the divorce of his aunt, Princess Margaret, from the Earl of Snowdon scandalized the royal family. For decades, Margaret had found herself at the center of scrutiny from within the royal family and from the public, mostly centered on her love life, at times drawing sympathy and at others attracting admonishment. Her fun-loving nature and glamorous lifestyle - with parties, extravagant clothes, and celebrity friends - became a staple of the British press. But her romance in the 1950s with Group Captain Peter Townsend, a divorced royal aide, was a tipping point. Her sister, Elizabeth, was head of the Church of England, which forbade divorce. And with memories of the uproar surrounding the abdication of King Edward VIII to marry a twice-divorced American still fresh, there was intense pressure on Margaret to end the affair. The princess chose not to step away from royal life and marry him. Nearly a decade later, she fell for a photographer, Antony Armstrong-Jones, who became the Earl of Snowdon after they married. But their tumultuous relationship ended in divorce in 1976. Margaret's love life became a major plot point in the Netflix period series ""The Crown,"" which explores the inner world of the royal family. A gaffe-prone Philip Elizabeth's 98-year-old husband, Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, has found himself in hot water over offhand comments to the press. Unlike his wife, who maintains a measured public persona, he can be blunt and prone to gaffes. Some of his comments have been offensive or outright racist. ""If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed,"" he told British students in China during a 1986 visit. ""It looks as if it was put in by an Indian,"" he said in 1999, pointing to an old-fashioned fuse box in a factory in Scotland. ""Everybody was saying we must have more leisure. Now they are complaining they are unemployed,"" he said during the 1981 recession. Early this year, he gave up his driver's license after a collision on a rural road north of London raised questions about his abilities behind the wheel. Two days after the crash, he was photographed driving without his seat belt fastened and was reprimanded by a police officer. The brief reign of Edward VIII In the 1920s, Prince Edward, Elizabeth's uncle, was so well known for his indulgences that he was the subject of a song: ""I danced with a man who danced with a girl who danced with the Prince of Wales."" But it was a relationship with one particular woman that ultimately shook the royal family. In 1930, he met Wallis Simpson, a married woman from Baltimore who traveled in the same high-society circles. After the death of his father, King George V, Edward pursued her despite the opposition of his mother, Queen Mary, and the prime minister at the time, Stanley Baldwin. When the prince succeeded his father to the throne in 1936, a standoff ensued. Simpson sought a divorce from her husband, and the British government advised the new king against marrying her. The government tried to keep the story out of the British press, but US newspapers broke the news.",['ENGLISH'],1127,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-37S3KRQMSEI6VAYBDQ2CCYGPI4,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009XG5', 'className': 'BRITISH MONARCHS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000CVO6', 'className': 'BRITISH ROYALTY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DM43', 'className': 'ROYALTY, NOBILITY & GENTRY'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000CTIZ', 'className': 'SCANDALS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODVCRjhDNURBRDYzNDAzNjlFMDA3ODgyMUQ0ODhDRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkzMEJFRkNCRUQwNEIyOEE3QTBDOEFFM0ZDRDg0NzU', 'className': 'Arrests'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DL5Q', 'className': 'TYPES OF GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000D92S', 'className': 'SEX TRAFFICKING'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX000875', 'className': 'HUMAN TRAFFICKING'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001418', 'className': 'PROSTITUTION'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Sex Crimes'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST0009U58', 'className': 'HISTORY'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000DLCL', 'className': 'MONARCHIES'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001335', 'className': 'PLEA AGREEMENTS'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX000394', 'className': 'COOKING & ENTERTAINING'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFCRjAwOERDM0JGNDQ4QjhEODU0MDYxOUE3QUY2RjM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc1MDBENkU0ODJCNDQ5MzkxNEFERjkzQTYwODQzRDA', 'className': 'Guilty Pleas'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'STX001930', 'className': 'CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODIxRjg3RUI0RENGNEM5OEFFNUU0RTY1MUZBMTVGOEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc', 'className': 'Prostitution'}], 'person': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'PE000DO0X', 'className': 'JEFFREY EPSTEIN'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'PE000D0JF', 'className': 'PRINCE ANDREW, DUKE OF YORK'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009UHO', 'className': 'ELIZABETH II, QUEEN OF THE UNITED KINGDOM'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX106', 'className': 'LONDON, ENGLAND'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'GX601', 'className': 'NEW YORK, NY, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '67', 'classCode': 'GS148', 'className': 'NEW YORK, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GC329', 'className': 'UNITED KINGDOM'}]}"

The No. 19 Hawkeyes forced three turnovers in Saturday's 19-10 win over Illinois, another stout performance from a defense that has been shutting teams down all season.","Iowa (8-3, 5-3 Big Ten), which came into the game allowing just 12.4 points per game, held Illinois to its lowest point total of the season one week after doing the same thing to Minnesota in a 23-19 win. ""There's no quit in those guys,"" Iowa quarterback Nate Stanley said. ""They kept us in a lot of games this year. And quite frankly, they've won a lot of games for this year with the way they've played."" This win was punctuated by the turnovers. Illinois quarterback Brandon Peters threw an interception to Michael Ojemudia on the Fighting Illini's first possession of the game, then threw an interception to Matt Hankins in the end zone in the third quarter. Peters also lost a fumble in the fourth quarter. ""That was big-time,"" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. ""We did a great job of getting takeaways."" The Illini (6-5, 4-4) saw their four-game winning streak come to an end. ""It definitely was big,"" Ojemudia said of getting the takeaways. ""We knew going into this game they were going to give us their best shot. They're a hot team. Just tightening down (on defense) was what we wanted to do in this game."" Iowa had forced just 13 turnovers in the first 10 games. ""We felt like we haven't been getting that many turnovers this year,"" safety Geno Stone said. ""I definitely feel like we got them this game."" The Illini, who had outscored opponents 79-22 in the second half in their winning streak, got into Iowa territory on three consecutive possessions in the second half, but only got a field goal. ""We had the opportunities,"" Illinois coach Lovie Smith said. ""But we didn't make the plays today."" Stanley threw for 308 yards and Keith Duncan kicked four field goals to set a new Big Ten single-season mark. Iowa opened the game with a touchdown for the second consecutive week when Tyler Goodson scored on a 2-yard run for a 7-0 lead. Illinois tied the game when Peters threw a 31-yard pass to Donny Navarro later in the first quarter. From that point, it was all field goals. Duncan had field goals of 23, 45, 24 and 29 yards to make it 27 this season for the conference record. Illinois' James McCourt kicked a 28-yarder in the fourth quarter. THE TAKEAWAY Iowa has won six consecutive games in this rivalry, but this was a competitive game. The Hawkeyes had won the last three games by a combined score of 137-16, including last season's 63-0 game. POLL IMPLICATIONS Iowa could move up a spot or two with the win. Illinois had received a vote in last week's poll. Both teams were already bowl eligible. KICKING GAME Duncan had his third game of the season with four field goals. He also missed two field goals in the game. Duncan is 27 of 32 in field goals this season. ""Of course, we would like to get touchdowns on every single drive,"" Duncan said. ""But our goal is to get points. We did that four out of the six times today on field goals, and we're happy to do that."" UP NEXT Iowa plays at Nebraska on Friday.

24,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",WORLD,,"Bolivian Senate OKs new election, bars ex-president",,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) - Bolivia's Senate on Saturday unanimously approved a measure calling for new presidential elections that would exclude ousted leader Evo Morales - a key step toward pacifying a nation since an Oct. 20 marred by reported irregularities.","The measure forbids reelection of anyone who has served the last two terms consecutively as president, effectively ruling out Morales, whose refusal to accept such term limits was a key issue in protests against him. The bill now goes to the lower house, which like the Senate is dominated by Morales' Movement Toward Socialism party. The measure did not set a date for the vote. Morales' claim of victory and a fourth term in the Oct. 20 election prompted massive protests that led him to resign on Nov. 10 at the army's suggestion. An audit by a team from the Organization of American States found widespread irregularities in that election. After Morales left for asylum in Mexico, his own supporters took to the streets in protest. Officials say at least 32 people have died in demonstrations since the presidential election, which would be annulled by Saturday's vote. An agreement on elections between Morales' party and the interim government helped pacify the country. Street blockades were lifted, allowing supplies to reach marketplaces Saturday in areas that had been short of groceries and gas. Sen. Oscar Ortiz said the bill calls for updating the electoral rolls, naming a completely new electoral tribunal to oversee the vote. ""We have to generate confidence in the population,"" said Sen. Omar Aguilar, from Morales' party. Later Saturday, interim President Jeanine Áñez rejected a bill presented by Morales' party that would have prevented the ousted president from being tried for alleged crimes committed during the exercise of his functions to date. ""With respect to approving this bill in favor of those who have committed crimes and who now seek impunity, my decision is clear and firm: I will not promulgate this law,"" Áñez said. The bill remains paralyzed, lawmakers said. On Friday, the interim government accused Morales of terrorism and sedition for purportedly organizing highway blockades intended to prevent food from reaching some cities. Acting Interior Minister Arturo Murillo said the complaint relates to a video in which Morales is supposedly heard in a phone call coordinating the blockades from Mexico. Murillo said Bolivia's government is seeking a maximum penalty, which is between 15 and 20 years in prison. Morales has said the video is a ""montage"" by his opponents.",['ENGLISH'],431,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-I6KO6N4TD5CSZGVAGBCCDSMBIE,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00097CZ', 'className': 'ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001371', 'className': 'HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001421', 'className': 'PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DL5Q', 'className': 'TYPES OF GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001709', 'className': 'TERM LIMITS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000CTCO', 'className': 'ELECTION FRAUD'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DH0Q', 'className': 'AGREEMENTS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000108', 'className': 'APPROVALS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001480', 'className': 'RESIGNATIONS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DL3J', 'className': 'INTERIM MANAGEMENT'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000DLOJ', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000DNEP', 'className': 'VOTER REGISTRATION'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'STX001932', 'className': 'CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg4MDhDQ0I2QkY5NDU2Rjg1RDNEREFBODk1Nzg1QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Terrorism'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DL5X', 'className': 'EVO MORALES'}], 'city': [{'score': '55', 'classCode': 'GX032', 'className': 'LA PAZ, BOLIVIA'}], 'country': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GC501', 'className': 'BOLIVIA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

Rudolph was fined $50,000 on Saturday by the NFL for his involvement in the melee that began when Browns defensive end Myles Garrett pulled off his helmet and hit him over the head with it.","Rudolph avoided suspension for his actions - he tried to pull off Garrett's helmet and charged him - but was one of 33 players fined by the league for their involvement. The league penalized 29 players $3,507 apiece for ""entering the fight area."" In all, the league handed out more than $700,000 for discipline stemming from the ugly final seconds of Cleveland's 21-7 win over Pittsburgh last week. There was another $77,206 assessed for personal fouls earlier in the game. Garrett was indefinitely suspended by the league for tearing off Rudolph's helmet and using it ""as a weapon."" His appeal was denied this week when he told appeals officer James Thrash that Rudolph used a racial slur against him. Rudolph wrestled with Garrett and unsuccessfully tried to yank off the Pro Bowler's helmet before running after him and then being struck on the top of the head. Earlier this week, Rudolph said there was ""no acceptable excuse,"" for his behavior. He has denied using the racial slur, and the league has found no evidence such a slur was used. The league also fined the Steelers and Browns $250,000 apiece. The AFC North rivals play again Dec. 1 in Pittsburgh. Garrett was also fined $45,623 for his shocking attack, which will cost him the rest of the regular season and playoffs - if Cleveland qualifies without him. Garrett will also lose $1.14 million in game checks. The league said Garrett must meet with Commissioner Roger Goodell's office before he can be reinstated. Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey was suspended three games and fined $35,096 for punching and kicking Garrett. Appeals officer Derrick Brooks reduced Pouncey's ban to two, but he'll miss next Sunday's game against the Steelers. Browns defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi was suspended for Sunday's game against Miami for shoving Rudolph to the ground.

26,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,"Navy may expel SEAL, defying Trump",,,"Link to Image The secretary of the Navy and the admiral who leads the SEALs have threatened to resign or be fired if plans to expel a commando from the elite unit in a war crimes case are halted by President Trump, administration officials said Saturday. The Navy is proceeding with the disciplinary plans against the commando, Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, who counts Trump as one of his most vocal supporters. After reversing a demotion in recent days, the president suggested on Thursday that he would intervene again in the case, saying that the sailor should remain in the unit.","FULL TEXT The threats by the Navy secretary, Richard Spencer, and the commander, Rear Admiral Collin Green, are a rare instance of pushback against Trump from members of the Defense Department. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, scrambled to come up with a face-saving compromise this past week in the hope that Trump could be persuaded to change his mind. On Thursday, Trump, referring to the pin that signifies membership in an elite force, said on Twitter that ""The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin."" He added: ""This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!"" One argument that officials said may be relied on is the assumption that a tweet does not constitute a formal presidential order. Esper and Milley conveyed to the president that if he followed up that tweet with a direct order, there would be huge consequences: Trump would lose Spencer and Green, further infuriate his top military leadership, and do untold damage to decades of military justice doctrine, according to administration officials. Administration officials said they now hoped that Trump would allow the proceedings to continue, but it is unclear whether the president will do so. The debate over Gallagher comes as Trump, facing a difficult reelection battle and an impeachment inquiry, has increasingly sought to highlight his role as commander in chief. Gallagher was accused of shooting civilians, murdering a captive Islamic State fighter with a hunting knife in Iraq, and threatening to kill SEALs who reported him, among other misconduct. His court-martial ended in acquittal on those charges. But the Navy ultimately demoted the chief, who was convicted of one charge: bringing discredit to the armed forces by posing for photos with the teenage captive's dead body. Gallagher's lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, said the president was right to stop the process of ousting the commando because the Navy's move was clear retribution, coming just days after the president's decision to restore his rank. ""With the timing, it's difficult to see how this was anything but a direct, public rebuke to the president,"" Parlatore said. ""So I can't see how the secretary of defense or anyone else is going to convince the president that is OK."" On Friday, Spencer made clear that he wanted to move forward with the matter, which could strip Gallagher of his Trident pin. ""I believe the process matters for good order and discipline,"" he told Reuters in an interview at a security forum in Nova Scotia. On Saturday, a Navy spokesman pointed to those remarks. ""The secretary's comments are in line with current White House guidance,"" said Rear Admiral Charlie Brown, the chief spokesman for the Navy. A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. The gold insignia Trident pin is one of the most revered in the military. It features an eagle on an anchor, clutching a flintlock pistol and a trident, and represents the grit of sailors who made it through some of the toughest training in the Navy, and are given some of the riskiest missions. It stands for fidelity and sacrifice. Even in death, the pin plays a role: SEALs pound their pins into the wood of fallen comrades' caskets. The Pentagon had already been quietly fuming this month after Trump cleared three members of the armed services, including Gallagher, who were accused or had been convicted of war crimes, overruling military leaders who sought to punish them. All three were lionized by conservative commentators who portrayed them as war heroes unfairly prosecuted for actions taken in the heat of battle. Trump, who was lobbied heavily by the families of the three service members, announced on Nov. 15 that he was reversing the demotion of Gallagher. He also ordered the full pardon of Clint Lorance, a former Army lieutenant, from the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, where he was serving a 19-year sentence for the murder of two civilians; and of Major Mathew L. Golsteyn, an Army Special Forces officer who was facing murder charges for killing an unarmed Afghan he believed was a Taliban bomb maker. One of the jurors who convicted Gallagher expressed dismay at the president's actions in an interview on Friday, noting that the all-military jury had given Gallagher the maximum punishment allowable under the law because it found his behavior so reprehensible. He spoke out for the first time to defend the decision of the jury. ""People keep saying all he did is pose in a photo and there were lots of other guys in the photo,"" said the juror, who asked that his name not be used to protect the privacy of the deliberations. ""But he was the senior enlisted guy there, the oldest, the most experienced. He should have set an example for good order and discipline. He should have ensured stuff like that wasn't happening. And he didn't. He doesn't deserve to wear chief's anchors."" The juror said he hoped the Trident review process would be allowed to go forward, adding, ""Let other SEALs decide if he deserves to be a SEAL.""",['ENGLISH'],991,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-2KSNINAOEYI6VK2QUEAUNBWRKU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00097CO', 'className': 'NAVIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0M2RDE1RTlBNDk4NDkxRDlBMTkwQ0JCNERDNTA5NUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM1OUEyRDNERTdENEU2MTk3RTlCNEJCRUY0NjRGRjQ', 'className': 'Armed Forces'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjM4QTc2RkMyMUVBNDlGMkEwRDEyMDkyNEVFNUNGOEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM1OUEyRDNERTdENEU2MTk3RTlCNEJCRUY0NjRGRjQ', 'className': 'Military Justice'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ5ODg4NkU4QzRDNDhFMDkzQTg0QkMxMjVBMzQyRjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEY2MzZGQUY0QTIzNDk2MjkxNEQwRDBCQzc1M0RFNTY', 'className': 'Murder'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTFBQjNDMzE0RjU1NEVDREJERTlFQUU2OTkzN0VCMjk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUZFQjE4NzUwODAyNDUzMzgxQzIxMUNBMTg2RTc5MTI', 'className': 'US Department of Defense'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjU1Q0FGMTcyM0M5NDQzMkIxQ0Y0NUFFQ0VGRjQ0MjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDEwQTI5QTZCNDQ4NEM2MUI3NTM4MUYzMDgyRDQwQzE', 'className': 'Contracts Clause'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000459', 'className': 'DEFENSE & MILITARY POLICY'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000D36R', 'className': 'EMPLOYEE DEMOTIONS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DLOJ', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUMxNTAwRTdFMERFNDUzNjk3OURBMUM3Qzg1RTJGOTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM1OUEyRDNERTdENEU2MTk3RTlCNEJCRUY0NjRGRjQ', 'className': 'Military Offenses'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001149', 'className': 'MISCONDUCT'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001480', 'className': 'RESIGNATIONS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001932', 'className': 'CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JU', 'className': 'CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N922110MJ', 'className': 'MILITARY COURTS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX002027', 'className': 'EMPLOYEE TERMINATION'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001566', 'className': 'SHOOTINGS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkE0QjE5NTNFNjk2NDMzRjlGQkNBNUVDN0IzRURCMkY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTYzQjQyOTBDNzNDNEI2QUIyOTE2MEYyMTdBQTlDMzI', 'className': 'War Crimes'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCOTRCOUUyN0I5NDA0MUEwMzIwOEVGODExQjA4RDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEUzMkE2MTZCMThENDAwNDhCM0I4RDA2OURFRDAwNDI', 'className': 'Motions for Acquittal'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST00099LR', 'className': 'MUSLIMS & ISLAM'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001464', 'className': 'RELIGION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0M2RDE1RTlBNDk4NDkxRDlBMTkwQ0JCNERDNTA5NUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM1OUEyRDNERTdENEU2MTk3RTlCNEJCRUY0NjRGRjQ', 'className': 'Armed Forces'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00097CO', 'className': 'NAVIES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000459', 'className': 'DEFENSE & MILITARY POLICY'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTFBQjNDMzE0RjU1NEVDREJERTlFQUU2OTkzN0VCMjk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUZFQjE4NzUwODAyNDUzMzgxQzIxMUNBMTg2RTc5MTI', 'className': 'US Department of Defense'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DO2J', 'className': 'MARK ESPER'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC358', 'className': 'IRAQ'}]}"

(AP) - Myles Powell yelled ""smile a little bit"" to Seton Hall coach Kevin Willard as the star player was on his way out of the media room. No chance.","Powell scored 23 points and Jared Rhoden had 10 points and 12 rebounds, leading No. 13 Seton Hall to an 87-51 victory over winless Florida A&M on Saturday. The Pirates pulled away from the Rattlers after a sleepy week of practice and a shaky start, and Willard wasn't pleased with his team's performance in front of a crowd of 9,656 at the Prudential Center. ""We had a great crowd coming for a 12 o'clock game,"" he said. ""We kind of slept walked through 20 minutes of a game. Our kids play hard, they're fun to watch, but you can't come out and sleepwalk when people come out and watch it. It's unacceptable."" Quincy McKnight had 14 points and five assists for Seton Hall (4-1), which led by 18 before carrying a 36-24 advantage into the break. Willard is ""just saying that as the team that we want to be that we got to practice to get better, not just to get through it,"" Powell said, ""and he said all week that's all we were doing, was just trying to get through practice and just get it over with. He said it shows today. ""The score - I don't feel as though we were playing our best basketball."" Rod Melton Jr. led Florida A&M with 12 points. M.J. Randolph had 11 points and nine rebounds. Florida A&M (0-5) pulled within single digits several times in the second half. Melton's basket on a break made it 43-35 with 16:08 left. After Nasir Core scored to trim Seton Hall's lead to 47-38 with 13:57 left, the Pirates responded with a 15-1 run. Powell made a layup to make it 62-39 with 9:25 remaining. BIG PICTURE Seton Hall: The Pirates continue to look the part of a Top 25 team despite their lulls against a lowly opponent. The next stretch will be a good litmus test for March - they head to the Bahamas for the Battle 4 Atlantis to play No. 11 Oregon and potentially No. 8 Gonzaga. No. 5 North Carolina, Alabama, Iowa State and Michigan are the other Power Five teams in the event. Florida A&M: Coming off a 12-19 season, the Rattlers are still looking for their first win of the season, and the upcoming schedule doesn't look very good. They visit Kansas State on Dec. 2 and No. 20 Tennessee on Dec. 4. POLL IMPLICATIONS With this being the only game of the week for Seton Hall, the Pirates should stay about where they are in the Top 25. SANDRO SITS Willard benched Sandro Mamukelashvili for the second half. Willard said he wasn't playing well.

29,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,Mike Babcock wasn't given enough runway in Toronto,,,"Link to Image Much like Vegas, every act grows old in coaching, and a voice gone stale was part of the reason why the Maple Leafs on Wednesday sent Mike Babcock packing some four-plus years into his record eight-year/$50 million pact to turn around the Blue and White. As measured by rounds won by the Leafs in the playoffs (zero), Babcock's coaching tenure in Toronto was an abject failure. But that would be an unfair portrayal of his full tenure behind the bench, an impressive 173-133-45 (.557) regular-season mark that included a pair of 100-point seasons and three playoff berths (8-12 record) the last three seasons. The Leafs, let us not forget, had DNQ'd for 9 of 10 postseasons prior to Babcock's arrival. They had morphed into Canada's version of the pre-Mike Ilitch Dead Wings. To date, they still haven't won a playoff round since 2004. A full generation of Leafs fans, among the most avid in the Original 31, now have lived without the sweet springtime intoxication of a Cup run in Southern Ontario.","FULL TEXT Now, did Babcock deserve to get whacked? Both his bona fides (including a Cup in Detroit, a pair of Olympic golds with Canada) and his overall mark across four seasons with the Leafs say no. He is the same solid, smart, determined bench mentor that led Leafs leadership, including team president Brendan Shanahan, to bring him aboard when he became a free agent in Detroit in the spring of 2015. But again, acts age out, voices lose their pitch, and perhaps more critical in this case, the 56-year-old Babcock lacked the equity (protection) that postseason success typically builds. If not for that mega contract, which lifted the pay level for coaching brethren across the league, he might have been turfed with no playoff success after only three seasons on the job. That's just the way it works. The equity of the '11 Cup and a trip to the '13 Final helped to keep Claude Julien on the job here even through the back-to-back playoff DNQ's of 2015 and '16. Fact is, if not for back-to-back Game 7 flip-of-the-coin knockouts at the hands of the Bruins the past two Aprils, perhaps Babcock is still on the job, even despite his tepid (9-10-4) start this season. Coaching, forever dirty work, even for guys with 700 career wins and a trophy case of shiny hardware (albeit one surprisingly lacking a Jack Adams Award as Coach of the Year). Hard to envision a quick turnaround for Sheldon Keefe, newly-installed as Babcock's successor, but many (hand high here) said exactly that in February 2017 when Bruce Cassidy was promoted to the No. 1 gig. Cassidy took control when the Bruins were doddering along at 26-23-6, both feet firmly planted on a path to a third consecutive DNQ. Cassidy's combination of change in offensive approach and overall messaging (read: new voice) delivered a galloping 18-8-1 finish and a date with Ottawa in playoffs. So it can happen, and Keefe, 39, much like Cassidy, helped channel upward of 10 current players to the Leafs' varsity during his stellar four-plus seasons in charge of the AHL Marlies, including a Calder Cup title in '18. Babcock is known as an old-school, no-nonsense taskmaster, though one laced with some keen wit. Keefe, long ago a fringe forward with the Lightning, will begin with a lighter message more like Cassidy's, emphasizing a slight change in the offensive attack and an overall less rigid, narrow game plan. ""He lets us be more creative,"" Marlies back liner and first-round pick, Timothy Liljegren told Sportsnet when the change was made Wednesday. A key difference, though, when comparing the Leafs of November 2019 and the Bruins on February 2017 is the overall structure and competence (i.e talent level) of the rosters. From the start, Babcock was handed a lineup riddled with holes, one that only became more porous amid the front-office transition that left Kyle Dubas standing as GM and Lou Lamoriello bolting for Long Island, where he has resurrected the risible Isles. The current Leafs roster is top heavy in elite and semi-elite, highly-expensive talent up front, including a $40 million-plus cap hit in four forwards: Mitch Marner, John Tavares, Auston Matthews, and William Nylander. Anyone would want them on their roster (remember, the Bruins pursued Tavares as a UFA in the summer of 2018), but at what price? Their cap drain is horrendous and compromising in a fixed-cap system. The Leafs have what at best could be labeled a highly-ordinary defensive unit, and they don't have a suitable backup to allow No. 1 goaltender Frederik Andersen to take a blow. Dubas, with Shanahan watching over him, has engineered a pricey, compromised, gritless squad designed around winning with today's standard model of speed and skill. That's a fine model, backed with a trove of analytics, but it's talented men and not Corsi-lovin' mathematicians who win games. The Bruins inherited by Cassidy had Anton Khudobin as a competent backup to No. 1 Tuukka Rask. They had captain Zdeno Chara as the unique shutdown lynchpin to a defensive corps that included the likes of Kevan Miller and Adam McQuaid as extra steel wool to smooth out, shall we say, rough spots. They had Patrice Bergeron, who that June would pick up his fourth Selke Trophy as the game's best defensive forward, as the NHL's consummate 200-foot player. From here, albeit some 500 miles southeast, there appears to be no quick fix for the Leafs on par with Cassidy's 18-8-1 igniter switch. Beyond the different voice behind the bench, which they may or may not have needed, they have to build some will and temerity around that slick forward group, find a first- or second-pairing defenseman who at least can increase level of play back there from a C-minus to a B, and also find a suitable (read: NHL capable) backup so Andersen, 30, isn't assigned to assisted living by early March. Easy enough to blame Babcock. In a span of 40 years now, the Leafs have turfed their coach eight times with the season in progress. They remain without a Cup since 1967. Not even five years after hiring Babcock to close the championship gap, today they only look further from the goal. TARGET OF CRITICISM Equipment fails for these fans Link to Image Vegas goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury made a dazzling, Cirque de Soleil-like save Tuesday night, springing backward from the top of his crease, twisting and flashing his glove (Ole!) to snare a Nic Petan backhand sweep that was all but certified for delivery to the top shelf. Just watching Fleury's gyrations triggered back spasms in your aged, faithful puck chronicler. ""I think those saves that make you feel you scored,"" Fleury, 34, told the media following the 4-2 VGK win over the Leafs. ""Those are the saves I love to play for."" The stop, with less than four minutes to go in regulation, kept Vegas in front, 3-2, and Cody Eakin sealed the deal with 21 seconds to go. It turned out to be Babcock's final night behind the Leafs' bench. As for the Fleury's stop, quickly labeled on the internet as the ""Superman Save,'' yes, it was stupendous. An absolute must-see on YouTube. But at the risk of sounding like a curmudgeon - or even worse, a Boomer! - it also served as yet another reminder how equipment innovations - specifically the lightweight leg pads, in this case - have diminished dramatically the ability for shooters to score. The game has grown simply too far weighted toward the goalies. The light, streamlined leg pads have been in vogue for 30-plus years. So many fans of the current game don't recall the days, well into the 1980s, when tenders wore heavy leather pads stuffed with animal hair (be it horse, deer, or otherwise). Those old pads absorbed sweat and ice shavings, adding weight and restricting mobility. Goalies have made dazzling saves, some even greater than Fleury's masterpiece, dating before the time of vulcanized rubber. When I started this gig in the late '70s, my game stories often centered on a holy trinity present in most games: a great goal, a great save, and a great fight. Too often now, games are minus all three, particularly the fighting (a good thing) and the dazzling goal (a tissue for an old man, please). Great saves? Because of the butterfly style, the state of the art in modern goaltending is more blocking than saving. Not much thrill in a block. Without those lightweight pads, chances of Fleury making that stop on Petan would have been all but zilch. Yes, he could have sprung back, but the heavy pads would have left his legs anchored to the ice like dock moorings. He might have snared the shot with an old leather glove, but those models were vastly smaller than today's outsized Venus flytraps. Prime scoring chances should have at least an equal chance of going in the net as the goalie has of keeping them out of the net. It's simply not the case. If Fleury's dazzling save doesn't prove it, the shootout alone should be proof. Slightly more than two of every three shooters fail to score in the shootout. Time to scale back the gear and at least make it a 50-50 proposition. Getting a leg up Lemelin was light years ahead Link to Image Jacques Plante was the father of the goalie mask, wearing it in an NHL game for the first time 60 years ago (Nov. 1, 1959) when he backstopped the Habs. The innovator of the lightweight leg pads? Ex-Bruins netminder Reggie Lemelin, who came to Boston in the summer of 1987, just months after he first started using the sponge-like leg coverings in his days as a Calgary Flame. ""The first ones were like gold-and-strawberry colored,"" Lemelin recalled the other day when reached by phone. ""Heck, they were talking about me everywhere - not for my saves, but for how I looked."" The revolutionary pads, recalled Lemelin, were the brainchild of Jim Lowson, an inventor/designer from Mill Valley, Calif., who initially approached Flames goalie Mike Vernon about the idea. Vernon, some eight-plus years younger than Lemelin, didn't have his interest piqued when Lowson made his sales pitch one day at practice. ""This guy comes in with these crazy pads,"" remembered Lemelin. ""He talks to Mike and says, 'Look, I've got this prototype. It's very light. It's all foam. But I need to work with somebody to help me develop this.' Mike is this kid, like 21 years old, and looking at him like he has two heads."" A disappointed Lowson ""got the hint,"" noted Lemelin, and headed out of the rink that day, a man with a cause but minus a goaltender. ""He's leaving, almost with his head down, and I come by and say, 'Hey, I am Reggie Lemelin, the other goalie,' '' he recalled. ""And he says, 'Oh, I know who you are.' And I said, 'Look, you approached the wrong guy - this kid doesn't give a crap about what you've got. He's just starting his career. But I might. Because I see the potential. I'll work with you.' And that's how it all started."" During the 1987 All-Star break, Lemelin flew to San Francisco to work out design specs with Lawson, and he finally used the first pair in an NHL game that March. Lowson and Lemelin soon worked with a Connecticut-based manufacturer, and within a year or two of Lemelin arriving in Boston, a handful of other NHL tenders were wearing the groundbreaking Aeroflex lightweight pads. Lemelin dusted off the one pair he kept in January 2016 for the Habs-Bruins alumni game at the Outdoor Classic at Gillette Stadium. The new pads weighed 2 ½ pounds each and absorbed no water. Lemelin's old leather pads, stuffed with deer hair, were approximately 6 pounds each when dry, and absorbed another 3 or 4 pounds of water weight during games. ""I got on the scale once after a game,"" recalled Lemelin, whose playing weight was approximately 170 pounds, ""and all the gear, including the pads, gloves, chest protector and all that came to 32 pounds.'"" Kiddingly, Lemelin added that his stand-up style in net was in large part because, ""I didn't want the sweat to drain into my equipment."" Now a membership ambassador at Ferncroft Country Club in Middleton, where he has worked the past three years, the 65-year-old Lemelin lives in Peabody and suits up as a forward with the Bruins Alumni squad. It takes a few hours for the former goalie's aches and pains to dissipate each morning. ""Might have been different if those pads were invented a few years earlier,"" he said, ""the bastards!"" Loose pucks Out of work less than a week after his abrupt dismissal by Sportsnet, Don Cherry began his career comeback Tuesday with his revived ""Grapevine"" podcast, joined by son Tim and grandson Del. Had ""Grapes"" apologized on air for his divisive ""you people"" comment made on Hockey Night In Canada, the ex-Bruins coach likely could have kept his TV gig. But he wouldn't budge. ""I lived in a vicious world,"" Cherry said on the podcast, summing up his long, oft-controversial TV tenure, ""and I lasted 38 years."" All subsequent ""Grapevine"" episodes will post on Mondays throughout the hockey season. ""I'm glad,"" added Cherry, ""I'm going out on my shield."" . . . Only one coach, Pat Burns, has won three Adams Awards as Coach of the Year: Burns, who won it with the Bruins in '98, also won it in Montreal ('89) and Toronto ('93).

Thankfully, we see fewer of those seek-and-destroy explosions in today' game, in large part because of rulebook changes that came in the wake of Matt Cooke's predatory head shot on Marc Savard. Kariya dished the puck as he approached his offensive blue line, admired his pass for a second, and got sent to Palookaville (shoulder to head) by the menacing Stevens. It took that hit on Savard some seven years later (March 2010) for the Lords of the Boards finally to decide to punish hits that primarily target a player's head . . .

The protest came on the UN's International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and is aimed at pressuring the French government before it unveils new measures Monday to tackle the problem. The measures are expected to include seizing firearms from people suspected of domestic violence and prioritizing police training so they won't brush off women's complaints as a private affair. ""We live in a culture that finds excuses for assailants,"" Alyssa Ahrabare, spokeswoman for activist group Osez le Féminisme (Try feminism), told The Associated Press. She called for better training for people in police stations and hospitals who come in contact with victims of domestic violence, and more shelters for abused women. Some of Saturday's marchers want 1 billion euros in government investment, though the funding is expected to fall far short of that. French activists have stepped up efforts this year to call attention to the problem, with an unusual campaign of gluing posters around Paris and other cities every time another woman is killed. The posters honor the women and call for action. The activists also hold protests, lying down on the pavement to represent the slain women. A 2014 EU survey of 42,000 women across all 28 member states found 26 percent of French respondents said they been abused by a partner since age 15, either physically or sexually. That's below the global average of 30 percent, according to UN Women. But it's above the EU average and the sixth highest among EU countries. Half that number reported experiencing such abuse in Spain, which implemented a series of legal and educational measures in 2004 that slashed its domestic violence rates. Conversations about domestic violence have also ratcheted up in neighboring Germany, where activists are demanding that the term ''femicide'' be used to describe such killings. In France, lawyers and victims' advocates say they're encouraged by the new national conversation, which they say marks a departure from decades of denial. Women aren't the only victims of domestic violence, but French officials say they make up the vast majority. Béatrice Donnard, 54, activist with the group NousToutes (All of Us), noted that killings often occur when a couple separates, saying, ""It's an entire system that needs to be taken down."" ""Each woman you talk to - you could ask your mother or your sister - has a story of sexual violence in one way or another. This has to stop. I think men understand that, and there are many of them here with us - welcome!""",['ENGLISH'],646,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-JXCICLAOEMI6VK2QUEAUNBWRKU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DNAL', 'className': 'GENDER BASED VIOLENCE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001851', 'className': 'WOMEN'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REE3RUI5RUNDMTgyNDU3Rjk2QUMwOTVBOUI1NDNFOTY', 'className': 'Crimes Against Persons'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001421', 'className': 'PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUU0MTkxNTgyRjJBNEY1NzkxMkU4NTIzODBBNTA4RDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTI3NjUxRTJFQkZENDgwREFDODlEQTc4MDkyOTJENkQ', 'className': 'Domestic Violence'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DM4K', 'className': 'MISOGYNY'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DNVT', 'className': 'ABUSE & NEGLECT'}, {'score': '86', 'classCode': 'N922120QM', 'className': 'POLICE FORCES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001970', 'className': 'TRENDS & EVENTS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000D89F', 'className': ""FEMINISM & WOMEN'S RIGHTS""}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000D73F', 'className': 'EUROPEAN UNION'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTYzQjQyOTBDNzNDNEI2QUIyOTE2MEYyMTdBQTlDMzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZCMUU5OEUyREYzNDM4MjkzMkFCQzA0MTM3QUY1NjQ', 'className': 'Human Rights'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST0009OZQ', 'className': 'LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000DKU4', 'className': 'UNITED NATIONS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'N624221MC', 'className': 'TEMPORARY SHELTERS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST0009QTB', 'className': ""WOMEN'S SHELTERS""}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX000656', 'className': 'EURO'}], 'industry': [{'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST0009OZQ', 'className': 'LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST000A5F8', 'className': 'ACTORS & ACTRESSES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX000656', 'className': 'EURO'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DGXS', 'className': 'EMMANUEL MACRON'}], 'city': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GX115', 'className': 'PARIS, FRANCE'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC317', 'className': 'FRANCE'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GT115', 'className': 'EUROPE'}]}"

32,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",CELTICS,,Marcus Smart unhappy with Pepsi Center security after fan allegedly told him to 'get on your knees',,,"Link to Image The NBA is investigating an incident between Boston guard Marcus Smart and a fan in Denver, after the Celtics guard said he heard a derogatory comment and was unhappy with the way that he believed security in the arena responded to the matter. Smart said a fan told him to ""get on your knees"" after he pursued a loose ball along the sideline during Friday's game in Denver. Smart said one of his feet got tangled in the frame of a courtside chair, and while he was trying to free himself when he heard the comment.","FULL TEXT NBA spokesman Tim Frank said Saturday the league is investigating the matter. ""The fan told me, 'That's right, stay on the ground, get on your knees,'"" Smart told reporters postgame Friday night. ""Excuse me? I just told him, 'Listen, just watch the game because if we retaliate to you guys and if we were on the street, I guarantee you wouldn't say that."" Smart said security at Denver's Pepsi Center essentially ignored him. At least one security guard was seen speaking to fans in that section moments after the fourth-quarter incident, but it was unclear if any further action was taken. ""I told them who it was,"" Smart said. ""They just looked at him and didn't even say anything to him, didn't even get him out of the game. Probably if I was a superstar, they probably would have did something but it is what it is. We're going to end up protecting ourselves eventually and it's not going to be pretty for those fans and we don't want that. The league doesn't want that."" The incident is just the latest in several derogatory exchanges that have caught the NBA's attention in recent months. Russell Westbrook, DeMarcus Cousins, Kyle Lowry and others were involved in such incidents last seasons, prompting the NBA to say that it wants arena security personnel to have zero tolerance for abusive or hateful behavior. Last season, Westbrook and Cousins were subjected to racist taunts in Salt Lake City and Boston and the fans involved in those incidents were banned by the Jazz and Celtics. Lowry was shoved by a minority partner of the Golden State Warriors' ownership group, seated courtside during the NBA Finals, and that person was banned from team business for a year by the league. The league has not released exact numbers of how many fans have been ejected for such incidents. But after a number of players met with the NBA this past offseason to air their concerns about safety and fan behavior, the league expanded the area in arenas most closely monitored when it comes to player-fan interaction. The top-priority area used to be just those seated with feet on the court itself or maybe the first couple rows of courtside seats; now, that area goes several rows deep in every building, plus the areas where teams and referees enter and exit the court. ""That's a problem in the league that we've got to fix,"" Smart said. ""If we retaliate to protect ourselves, we're the ones getting in trouble. They're not. And that's not right. ... There's nowhere in this league for it."" This is not the first incident between Smart and a fan. In 2014, when he was playing for Oklahoma State, Smart was suspended three games for shoving a Texas Tech fan after a play where he crashed into some baseline seats following a blocked shot. Smart got up, then turned around and exchanged words with the fan before giving him a two-handed shove. Smart later apologized, and said it was ""a lesson I'll have to learn from.""",['ENGLISH'],611,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-FSPHZUQODYI6VNI5JO7YRLZ35U,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000171', 'className': 'BASKETBALL'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009SE3', 'className': 'STADIUMS & ARENAS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000A0TH', 'className': 'BASKETBALL TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST000DA0C', 'className': 'RACISM & XENOPHOBIA'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DLGX', 'className': 'RUSSELL WESTBROOK'}], 'city': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GX545', 'className': 'DENVER, CO, USA'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'GX593', 'className': 'SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '70', 'classCode': 'GS160', 'className': 'UTAH, USA'}]}"

Markstrom stopped 32 shots and then denied seven more during an extended shootout, helping the Canucks beat the Washington Capitals 2-1 on Saturday. Markstrom was in net for Vancouver's 6-1 loss at Dallas on Tuesday in the opener of a six-game strip. Rather than opt for Thatcher Demko two days later in Nashville, Green stayed with Markstrom, who made 45 saves in a 6-3 win.","He followed that victory with another strong showing against the NHL-leading Capitals. ""We debated a little bit,"" Green said. ""I think we wanted to show him some confidence as well, get him back in the net right away. And he's given us two big games after that."" Elias Pettersson scored his 10th goal for Vancouver, which earned its second straight win since a stretch of seven losses in eight games. It was the Canucks' 12th power-play goal in their last seven games. Bo Horvat scored the decisive goal in the seventh round of the shootout, completing Vancouver's first win while scoring two times or fewer. ""We've been talking about, sometimes it's not going to be 5-3 ... or what not,"" Markstrom said. ""It's going to be 1-0 or 2-1. And it's nice to win one of those."" Washington managed just one goal for the second straight game and third time this season despite Vancouver losing defenseman Alexander Edler to an upper-body injury. Green declined to provide an update on Edler after the game. Jakub Vrana scored his 11th goal for the Capitals, and Braden Holtby made 32 saves. ""You play the game that's presented to you and lately obviously we've been playing a few more lower-scoring games,"" Holtby said. ""We're trying to get better defensively and just finding ways how to create offense while doing that too and that's this time of year where it's cat and mouse trying to find your best game."" Washington thought it had taken the lead in the shootout on Lars Eller's attempt in the fifth round. Originally credited as a goal, it was overturned after replays showed Eller's shot striking Markstrom's leg and then the post, but never crossing the goal line. Even the goalie was fooled. ""I usually listen to the referees, and he pointed to the net, and I thought it was a goal,"" Markstrom said. ""And then it wasn't."" Vrana put Washington in front with a one-timer 2:22 into the game after Eller dug the puck off the boards to set him up. Pettersson responded with six minutes left in the first, ripping another one-timer past Holtby's glove side on a 5-on-3 power play during which defenseman Michal Kempny lost his stick. The Canucks had a power-play chance in overtime after Evgeny Kuznetsov hooked Christopher Tanev, but Holtby denied Quinn Hughes and J.T. Miller. On the other end, Markstrom twice stood up Alex Ovechkin inside the final minute of overtime. ""I thought this was a real gutty win by our team,"" Green said. ""It's one thing to beat a team when you score four or five goals. But to push this game the way both goalies were playing, it was a nice win."" NOTES: Canucks C Jay Beagle (lower body) sat out again after missing three games earlier this month. ... Washington conceded five or more penalties for the first time since Nov. 7. ...

(AP) - Auburn's defense held Samford to 114 yards and forced four turnovers, JaTarvious Whitlow scored twice, and the No. 16 Tigers tuned up for the Iron Bowl with a 52-0 victory Saturday at rain-drenched Jordan-Hare Stadium. Auburn forced and recovered a fumble on a fourth-and-4 on Samford's opening drive, the first of three turnovers and a trio of three-and-outs across Samford's first six possessions.","For the game, the Tigers also had 13 tackles for loss and held Samford to 2 yards per play, 2 of 13 on third down as Auburn's defensive starters were benched a few minutes into the third quarter. Samford had scored in 213 straight games. ""I think if they are in any other division they're probably in the top five,"" Samford head coach Chris Hatcher said. ""That defensive front they have is phenomenal. They've got a great quarterback and some great skill players to go along with him. All in all, we just played a team that was a lot better than us."" As the rain increased, so, too, did Auburn's offensive production. After a seven-point first quarter in which they struggled to convert third downs and had a 43-yard field goal blocked, the Tigers had 193 yards of offense and 24 points in the second. Whitlow and D.J. Williams accounted for 130 yards from scrimmage in the first half and Williams added his second touchdown of the season in the third quarter. The Tigers nearly eclipsed 300 rushing yards for the second time this season, finishing with 294 and four rushing scores. ""We knew it was going to rain,"" Auburn receiver Seth Williams said. ""We knew it wasn't going to be the best conditions. But we approached it right."" After completing 15 of 23 passes for 150 yards and a score, Bo Nix's day also was done early in the third quarter. That allowed 24-year-old redshirt freshman Cord Sandberg, a former member of the Philadelphia Phillies minor league baseball organization, to take the majority of second-half snaps under center. Sandberg made the most of his first appearance of the year, accounting for 115 yards from scrimmage and throwing the first two TD passes of his Auburn career - both to junior college transfer Zach Farrar. NIXED RECORDS With a 10-yard touchdown pass to Harold Joiner in the second quarter that put Auburn up 21-0, Nix passed Stan White for the most completions (181) and tied him for the most touchdowns (14) by a freshman quarterback in program history. Nix needs 50 passing yards and a touchdown in Auburn's final two games to break White's single-season marks from 1990 in both categories. CARLSON'S STRUGGLES Auburn sophomore kicker Anders Carlson had a 43-yard field goal blocked in the first quarter. The younger brother of SEC all-time leading scorer Daniel Carlson is now 9 for 25 on kicks of more than 40 yards in his Auburn career. IRON BOWL QUESTIONS Auburn is facing uncertainty at two key positions heading into the 83rd Iron Bowl. Reserve safety Jamien Sherwood, who has 25 tackles, three pass breakups, four tackles for loss and two quarterback hurries over the past five games will miss the first half against the Crimson Tide after being ejected for targeting in the third quarter against Samford. Additionally, Auburn started Kaleb Kim, who lost his starting job at center three weeks ago, at right guard over Mike Horton, the usual first-teamer at that spot. However, when Kim was injured in the second quarter, freshman Jalil Irvin filled in for him instead of Horton. Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said postgame that Horton suffered a minor injury last week and is expected to be ""fine"" to start against Alabama. UP NEXT Samford's regular season ends at 5-7. It's not expected to make the FCS playoff field. Auburn hosts Alabama in the Iron Bowl next Saturday. The Tigers are looking to win their third of the last four matchups played in Jordan-Hare Stadium. ""We've got the Iron Bowl at home,"" Malzahn said.

35,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",CELTICS,,15 thoughts as the Celtics return from their five-game road trip,,,"Link to Image The Celtics concluded their grueling five-game West Coast swing with a 2-3 record following Friday's 96-92 loss to the Nuggets in Denver. Here are 15 thoughts about the trip: ""  The optimist's take: The Celtics played quite well without one of their top players, Gordon Hayward, they nearly took out one of the West's top teams without Hayward and Kemba Walker, and they were a Marcus Smart roll and another bounce or two away from beating both the Kings and Clippers. ""  The pessimist's take: Their only wins were an uninspiring close call against the Warriors, who might be the worst team in the NBA, and the Suns, who were missing their starting point guard (Ricky Rubio) and center (DeAndre Ayton).","FULL TEXT ""  The results aside, the best news the Celtics received during the trip was that the head injury Walker suffered against the Nuggets is not considered serious. He plowed into Semi Ojeleye headfirst, collapsed to the ground, and was almost motionless, and the reaction of those around him indicated the possible severity of the situation. But Walker is expected to be fine, and according to one team source may not have even suffered a concussion, although he will likely have to go through the league-mandated concussion protocol because he initially experienced some concussion-like symptoms. ""  Brad Wanamaker's ascension has been the Celtics' most pleasant surprise over the first 15 games. He is getting more playing time since Hayward's injury, and has stepped in and become one of Boston's most trusted and reliable options, even in critical moments. In the seven games since Hayward was hurt, Wanamaker is averaging 10.7 points, 4 assists, and 2.1 rebounds while shooting 53.5 percent from the field and making 25 of 26 free throws. ""He's been one of our best players on the trip, bench or starters,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""He's been one of our best players and he really gave us a chance [against Denver]."" ""  The Celtics battled in the loss to the Nuggets after Walker went down with his injury. But it was also quite clear that Denver almost completely removed its foot from the gas pedal after it soared to a 19-point lead with less than 15 minutes left. The Celtics deserve credit for their resilience, but the Nuggets flipped the switch back when they needed to. ""  We interrupt this regularly scheduled Celtics chatter to inform you that Kyrie Irving will not be coming to Boston when the Nets face the Celtics on Wednesday. He is sidelined with a shoulder issue, but this news quickly generated a collective eye roll across New England. ""  Smart looked like he'd just been through a prizefight as he limped out of the locker room on Friday night. He is dealing with a sore ankle and probably a sore everything else, but that never stopped him from throwing his body around like the court was made with sponges instead of hardwood. Smart was responsible for the signature defensive play of the trip, when he batted the ball away from Clippers star Kawhi Leonard, then sprawled across the floor to grab the loose ball and fire it off of Leonard's leg, giving Boston a chance late in Wednesday's game. ""  Speaking of Smart, he was also involved in an altercation with a fan during the Nuggets game. It was sparked - unsurprisingly - by Smart hurtling his body into the stands to chase a loose ball. He said that his foot got stuck in a chair, and a fan there told him to stay on the ground and get on his knees. ""I just told him, 'Listen, just watch the game,' because, if we retaliate to you guys, or we were on the street, you probably wouldn't say that,' "" Smart said. "" 'I guarantee you wouldn't say that because we're grown men just like you.' "" Smart was upset about the incident, but especially frustrated that arena security did not appear to do anything. ""We're going to end up protecting ourselves eventually,"" Smart said, ""and it's not going to be pretty for the fan, and we don't want that."" ""  Despite the 2-3 record that followed their 10-game win streak, the Celtics have done enough to make it clear they will be a very good team this season. It does still seem like they're one piece away from being a potentially great team, but the problem is there's no clear answer about what that piece might be, and how it could be acquired. The team's rookies have not done enough to become enticing trade pieces, and the Celtics' center-by-committee of Daniel Theis, Robert Williams, and Enes Kanter has actually played quite well. The good news for Danny Ainge is that he has three months until the trade deadline, and he still has some future draft assets to play with if he wants. ""  Having said that, Hayward's presence sure would have helped over these last five games. ""  Jayson Tatum is taking on a larger workload this season following the departures of Irving and Al Horford. His usage rate has spiked from 22.1 percent last season to 27.3 this year, and he is attempting 5.3 more shots per game. As a result, there will be times when Tatum takes tougher shots against tougher defenders, but he would still like to be a bit more efficient. He is shooting 40.9 percent overall, 37.1 percent on 3-pointers, and 79.3 percent from the foul line, which would all be career lows. ""  It is becoming increasingly apparent how much Stevens enjoys coaching this team. It is a return to the hard-playing, scrappy groups that defined the pre-Irving era, and there is once again a sense that this team will not quit, no matter the deficit. After Friday's near-miss comeback, Stevens called the veterans ""warriors"" multiple times. Those are the kinds of players he wants to coach. ""  Grant Williams's 3-point misses are now becoming a thing. He is 0 for 19 this season. Teams are often leaving him wide open behind the line, as the Nuggets did twice in Friday's game. Williams was a below-average 3-point shooter at Tennessee, but he had shown promise from beyond the NBA arc during summer league and the preseason. Plenty of his line-drive shots have missed badly, and it seems it's more of a mental hurdle he'll have to clear. He said he is confident that he will. ""  Entering Saturday night's action, the Celtics, Heat, 76ers, and Raptors were all still undefeated at home, with a combined record of 23-0. ""  Peyton Manning was at Friday's game in Denver. During a timeout he tossed a pass to the team's fluffy mascot and it fell incomplete, bolstering Tom Brady's case as the best there ever was.

36,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",METRO,,They grew up at the Boston Children's Theatre. Now they look back with alarm,,,"Link to Image An invitation to join Burgess Clark's private advanced acting class at the Boston Children's Theatre meant you were going places. Clark, the theater's esteemed director since 2008, handpicked the 15 or so students he wanted in the class and made it clear he considered them the crème de la crème. Many of the teenagers were thrilled to be chosen. The group Clark ran could feel like a family: intensely close, competitive, affectionate, and secretive. Only years later did some former students begin to think more critically about what, exactly, had transpired in those acting classes and in private lessons with Clark.","FULL TEXT ""I didn't really notice it until I had already graduated,"" said Jake Wetmore, 20, a former BCT student now studying musical theater in Los Angeles. ""I would think back on things that happened in my acting classes, and I would think, that's not something that should be happening."" As adults with distance from the program and new insight from the #MeToo movement, the Children's Theatre alums found that certain aspects of that coveted class didn't sit right anymore, including the uncomfortable intimacy between Clark and his students; the strange exercises that sometimes ended with teenagers sprawled on top of each other or shouting insults at their classmates; the intense personal sharing that left many students shaking and crying; the emphasis on secrecy; and the rarity of doing what is traditional in most acting classes: using scripts. Wetmore began to talk to other graduates; they checked their reactions against each other. ""We would be like, 'That was weird, right?' "" he said. He was among a group of 17 former students who sent a letter to the theater's board late last month, detailing a range of negative experiences with Clark; three alleged that Clark had kissed or touched them inappropriately. Beverly police are investigating; no charges have been filed. A group of older alums sent a second letter describing their own disturbing encounters. Clark has resigned, and Toby Schine, BCT's executive director, who was not accused of misconduct, left last week. The theater also cut ties with Clark's partner, Daniel Blake, after the Globe found that he and Clark had been reprimanded for their behavior with students at a youth arts camp in Colorado (there was no evidence of criminal conduct). None of the three men responded to multiple requests for comment. BCT's board president, Jim Solomon, said he had no idea what had been going on in the acting classes until the students lodged their complaints. Clark ""did get people to really reach down deep into themselves"" and tap into their emotions, Solomon said. ""However, I think that his M.O. might have been that he takes vulnerable children, he tears them down, and then he builds them back up. So they're left craving his adulation and admiration."" He added, ""Anything that pushes romantic or sexual themes, to me, there's really no place for."" When students received an invitation from Clark to be part of his ""Actor's Core"" class, many said they were elated. ""When he invited me to it, I just felt on top of the world,"" said Megan McMahon, who was in the private class from 2011 to 2013 and later worked at the theater. The elite students starred in productions each season; for them, BCT was an all-encompassing world. Clark's classes usually began with students sitting in a circle on the floor of a classroom at the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology in the South End and sharing personal stories about themselves. The prompts ranged, former students said, from relatively light queries to uncomfortably intimate questions. ""I have a vivid memory of us all sitting in a circle and holding hands,"" said Jess Marlor, a composer and educator in New York who was part of the theater from 2009 to 2011. She recalled Burgess telling the students to share a secret they had never shared with anyone else. ""It can't be something simple,"" she remembered him saying. ""It has to be something that touches your core."" Marlor said students talked about sexual assault and suicidal thoughts; soon many of them were crying. She remembers being frightened. Other students described circles in which they were asked to discuss the worst thing that anyone had ever said to them or in which they discussed sexual traumas. In classes with college students and adults, difficult stories do come up, said Deb Margolin, a professor of playwriting and acting at Yale. But students guide the way and can dictate the level of disclosure, choosing what to share in open-ended exercises. ""Theater is about the revelation of humanity. And I know no other way than a very personal approach,"" Margolin said. But, she said, that puts an important responsibility on educators ""to be clinical and to treat people's boundaries with respect."" And working with children, who may not feel able to push back, requires even more care. ""It's incredibly reckless and irresponsible to ask them to divulge information that I have no way of guiding them through,"" said Amanda Kibler, the education director at The Coterie theater in Kansas City. Kibler pointed out that although acting can feel therapeutic, most acting teachers are not licensed therapists. When students begin to share very personal information with her, she stops them and asks them to take a deep breath instead. A different tone was set at the Boston Children's Theatre. There, between classes, students would brainstorm ""risky questions"" to ask specific peers at the next class and send them to Clark over Facebook Messenger (the Globe reviewed screenshots of some of those conversations). ""What is the root of your eating disorder?"" one student suggested asking another in a Facebook message to Clark. Clark prized what he viewed as emotional risk-taking, claiming it would help students become better actors. He would often ask students, who were mostly between 14 and 18 years old, about their sex lives, alums said. ""Within the class, he would ask questions about virginity, if you'd have sex, if you're comfortable with sex, how does sex affect your art?"" Wetmore said. Students weren't obligated to share, ""but the energy of the room and what he celebrated was people one-upping each other."" One student, who requested anonymity, said Clark asked him during a private acting lesson if he masturbated and what he did in his sexual fantasies. He was 15 at the time. The boy's mother confirmed to the Globe that her son told her about the lessons around two years after they happened. Clark told members of the acting class that they shouldn't disclose what happened during the sessions to people outside the room, including family and friends, according to several former students, because they were sharing such personal stories. Alongside standard improvisational games, Clark sometimes facilitated a darker kind of spontaneity. During one session in April 2011, Clark encouraged the class to call each other names like ""slut"" and ""skank,"" some former students said. Tensions escalated, and the exercise culminated in students shoving and pushing each other, but Clark didn't intervene, they said. Futaba Shioda, who was in Clark's acting class that day, said the exercise was framed by Clark as a way to explore bullying behaviors. ""I wanted to opt out,"" said Shioda, now an actor in New York City. ""I remember there was no place to go."" McMahon, who is now 25, said both Clark and Blake ""were very involved in our romantic and sex lives."" She recalled telling Blake that she had feelings for another girl in the class; Blake, she said, told her that bisexuality wasn't real and that she must be gay, which she took as a fact. McMahon's mother, Laura McMahon, said the family had ""moved heaven and earth"" so that Megan could get the kind of theater training that BCT promised. ""When a parent entrusts their child to someone else, you give up your power,"" Laura McMahon said in a recent interview. ""I wake up every morning a different kind of mad about it."" Other elements of the acting class seemed designed to provoke interpersonal drama in the teenagers' lives. Teresa Gelsomini, who is now 21 and studying acting at Ithaca College, recalled Clark asking his students to write down what they thought about other people in the class; Clark then read aloud the comments, some of which were hurtful, one by one. ""The amount of manipulation was crazy,"" Gelsomini said. In hindsight, she said, the students' passion for theater made them more vulnerable; they would have done anything to be actors. Many, like Gelsomini, are pursuing theater professionally, and it has been difficult to reconcile their past devotion to BCT with the sense that Clark took advantage of them.  ""That place, even though a lot of messed up things happened, it's still a really big part of my teenage years,"" Gelsomini said. ""Doing theater classes really brought me an insane amount of joy."" Clark also praised students for taking physical risks in exercises that sometimes ended with teenagers intertwined. ""The way that [the exercises] always progressed was very sexual. People would be on top of each other, really intimate positions,"" said Wetmore. It wasn't until he graduated and went to acting school that he realized those exercises weren't common in conventional acting classes. Like many of the former students who spent years at the Boston Children's Theatre and like many of the parents who trusted the adults in charge, Wetmore felt betrayed. ""I thought it was helping my acting,"" he said. ""I was under the impression that these were really specific things that were designed for advanced actors.""

39,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",MARIJUANA,,"Inside the Walmart of Weed: from rural Canada, Big Marijuana seeks to dominate global market",,,"Link to Image SMITHS FALLS, Ontario - The skunky, floral smell of growing marijuana is everywhere, from the parking lot outside the cavernous warehouse, to the lobby, even inside the coffee nook where employees take a break. The building itself is a chocolate brown box that once housed a Hershey's candy factory. In just one wing, a labyrinth of white halls links seemingly endless rows of windowless rooms, some the size of a school gymnasium, with fields of cannabis inside growing under bright white and yellow lights. Workers wheel carts piled high with bales of green buds. In large open-floor production rooms, assembly lines of machinery pump out pot products, scores of perfectly rolled joints from the silver fingers of one, slews of red pills for medical marijuana patients in Germany spilling from another. Welcome to the Walmart of Weed.","FULL TEXT With Canada the largest nation to completely legalize marijuana, the world's most valuable pot company, Canopy Growth Corp., has set up shop in this rural town seven hours northwest of Boston. Founded in 2013 and now worth about $6.4 billion, Canopy is one of the most watched and most controversial pot companies, the embodiment of Big Marijuana that critics contend uses size, market power, and lobbying prowess to accelerate the loosening of cannabis laws around the world and shoulder out competitors and smaller businesses. ""We're seen as 'corporate cannabis,' the big kid on the block,"" said D'Arcy McDonell, a Canopy spokesman, as he conducted a tour of the factory earlier this year. ""What makes it corporate cannabis? Success, basically."" Already Big Alcohol, Big Tobacco, and Big Pharma have bought their way into Canopy and other marijuana companies. And, like those longstanding giants, the new cannabis corporations are spending millions of dollars lobbying for laws that let them sell large volumes of potentially addictive products. Even in the Holy Land of marijuana - Jamaica - Canopy and other Canadian companies have contracted with local businesses to gain a foothold in the nation's new medical market, anticipating a day when they can export ganja from the home of Bob Marley, while small traditional cannabis farmers are struggling to meet regulatory requirements. ""We're seeing almost exactly the same thing"" with marijuana as with tobacco and alcohol, said Dr. Sharon Levy, who runs the adolescent substance use program at Boston Children's Hospital. ""Honestly, at what point do we say, 'We're not going to allow people to get rich on the health of other people?' "" As with cigarettes, advertising for marijuana is sharply limited in Canada and the United States. But pot companies have found ways around such rules using sleek videos on social media. Canopy, for example, has announced ventures with celebrities Drake, Seth Rogen, Martha Stewart, and Snoop Dogg. Its new line with Drake was promoted on the rapper's Instagram page, which has nearly 62 million followers. Massachusetts has tried to limit corporate domination in the pot business. But as the Globe Spotlight Team reported earlier this year, some bigger pot operators have            tried to skirt the state's cap on licenses and exploit the mandate to foster a diverse industry by recruiting minority entrepreneurs to serve as the local face of the company while              maintaining substantial control over the businesses. Companies have            also hired former politicians and consultants to help them win coveted permits from municipalities.  Canopy executives say the nascent marijuana market has room for all types of businesses, while insisting its size is an asset: The company can produce enough marijuana to meet the growing demand at prices that keep consumers from buying on illicit markets - a crucial need for legalization to succeed; it also has the wherewithal to impose the tight quality and security controls governments require of a regulated drug. ""There's a lot of good things we can do with our scale and our size,"" Canopy chief executive Mark Zekulin said. As countries around the world loosen medical cannabis laws - with global consumer spending on legal pot projected to hit $40 billion by 2024 - the jockeying for primacy in this growing industry is largely among a handful of large Canadian companies. In recent years, Canopy started exporting medical marijuana to Germany and Australia, and is building a hub in Denmark to supply Europe. The company also has operations in Colombia, Brazil, and southern Africa. And this year, Canopyinked a $3.4 billion deal to buy one of the biggest US pot companies, Acreage Holdings, whose            board includes former House speaker John Boehner and ex-Massachusetts governor William Weld. The deal hinges on changes to US law easing marijuana restrictions. While recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states, to date federal law has limited the size of pot companies by hampering access to financial markets and cross-state commerce. But that is poised to change. The US House of Representatives recently passed a cannabis banking bill, which, if signed into law, would likely allow Big Marijuana companies to explode in the United States. Many policy analysts say the US has to find a better way to regulate potentially addictive products to avoid repeating the market consolidation and public health issues associated with tobacco, alcohol, and addictive pharmaceuticals. ""This isn't about saying, 'We need to smash capitalism'; it's about mitigating the excesses of corporate capitalism,"" said Steve Rolles, a London-based policy analyst with Transform Drug Policy Foundation, who advised Canada on marijuana regulation. ""Emerging cannabis markets could be a really great opportunity to show how we could build new markets to serve the public interest and not allow these harms. In five to 10 years, that boat will have sailed."" Public health concerns One of Canopy's newest innovations is the creation of branded pot-infused beverages - such as a ginger ale drink - that have recently become legal in Canada and are expected to hit licensed stores there in mid-December. The effort benefited from the expertise of Constellation Brands, a conglomerate that owns Corona beer, Svedka vodka, Robert Mondavi wines, and other popular alcohol brands. Constellationinvested $4 billion in Canopy in 2018, giving it 38 percent of the company and            four seats on its seven-member board. Constellation ""saved us decades of knowledge-gathering,"" said Mario Castillo, Canopy's eastern Canada regional manager. Meanwhile, Cronos, another Canadian cannabis company, received a $1.8 billion investment last year from Altria Group, maker of Marlboro and other cigarette brands, giving the tobacco giant a 45 percent stake in the pot company. Both tobacco and marijuana industries see potential in vaping technologies that can appeal to both consumers and regulators, especially given the recent concern over vaping-related lung illnesses. Public health advocates fear such partnerships will inevitably follow a harmful playbook. Levy, the Boston Children's Hospital pediatrician, co-wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine that she expects marijuana companies to follow a roadmap drawn up by the tobacco industry: ""deny addiction potential, downplay known adverse health effects, create as large a market as possible as quickly as possible, and protect that market through lobbying, campaign contributions, and other advocacy efforts."" As with alcohol and tobacco, marijuana companies' revenues rely on heavy consumption from regular users: Daily and near-daily cannabis consumers account for 75 percent of spending in the industry, a 2016 study in the Journal of Drug Issues found. That dynamic incentivizes companies to create more potent and more addictive products, such as ""dabs,"" waxy clumps of highly concentrated marijuana that are often smoked with a blowtorch-like device, and are popular with teenagers, Levy said. Federal drug laws have long prevented funding well-designed studies on marijuana. Now, cannabis companies are paying for research they hope will demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of their products, raising questions about conflicts of interest tainting supposedly unbiased scientific inquiry. What scientists do know: Cannabis can be addictive, though less so than alcohol, cigarettes, and opioids. Frequent pot use can affect memory, motivation, and cognitive functioning. Heavy use of high-potency marijuana has been            linked to psychosis in studies, though it's            unclear why. On the other hand, cannabis can provide medical relief for people with such conditions as epilepsy, cancer, and chronic pain. Most US states that have legalized pot - such as Massachusetts - have chosen for-profit models through ballot initiatives, said Beau Kilmer, director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center. That's unfortunate, he said, because it limits voters to a ""yes"" or ""no"" choice on legalization generally, without understanding how it will be implemented and the range of possible alternatives. Options that could lead to better health results than the for-profit model, Kilmer said: government-run stores, such as those implemented in some Canadian jurisdictions, or requiring cannabis producers to be nonprofits or to follow rules for socially responsible corporations. ""If you talk to folks who are pro-legalization outside of the United States,"" Kilmer said, ""they look at the US and say, 'Why are you allowing the big companies to control this?' "" Social justice Canopy has hired inventors and engineers, and filed for hundreds of patents for its products and processing equipment. One machine, for example, can do the work of nine people checking the weight and packaging of jars of marijuana. These efficiencies are one example of how large corporations can outmuscle smaller competitors. This has implications for a big ambition of marijuana advocates - that legalization would benefit black and Hispanic communities that were targeted during the war on drugs, a cornerstone of Massachusetts' legalization law. The state has taken steps to help locals start pot businesses, but Kilmer questions their long-term prospects. If the United States legalizes cannabis across state borders, the bigger companies by dint of their reach would have access to many more markets, he said, and could further undercut local operations by growing pot at scale in warmer climes at lower cost, taking the jobs there with them. Shaleen Title, a Massachusetts cannabis commissioner who helped craft the state's measures aimed at boosting small businesses, said it was important for government officials to avoid unnecessary ""fear-based policies,"" like requirements that marijuana businesses not locate near certain types of other businesses such as funeral homes, which can drive up real estate costs. ""Companies with unlimited resources love barriers to entry and requirements that demand large amounts of capital,"" Title said, ""because such requirements push others out and give the already-privileged a boost toward the market domination and market consolidation that they're seeking."" One of the Massachusetts measures she supported is a cap on each company of three licenses of each kind - retail, cultivation, or production, for example. Zekulin, the Canopy CEO, said the company expects to compete in those markets that have licensing limits by selling other retailers its branded and patented products for sleep, pain, and anxiety that are under development now. 'Cannabis colonialism' With Canada serving as a model for legalizing marijuana, Canopy has hosted tours for government officials from around the world, giving it an opportunity to pitch looser cannabis laws. That worries activists, who say the Canadian system has shut out smaller businesses. ""Canopy is going around telling every government on Earth, 'Do it like us, grow the plants in prison-like facilities with big walls and concrete, we know what we're doing, don't let in those little people,' "" said Jodie Emery, a Canadian marijuana activist. ""This reeks of cannabis colonialism."" In Colombia, Lesotho, and other countries, Canopy has acquired local companies or is contracting with them. Those investments, Canopy points out, have provided stable incomes and health insurance to locals who have never had such benefits. ""To us, it's inherent to always be giving back and always be locally committed,"" Zekulin said, adding the company is also working with researchers and doctors in those countries. But activists see such moves as the wealthy further enriching themselves off the poor. In Jamaica, where medical marijuana is legal and recreational smoking is decriminalized, small-scale cannabis farmers were ""hopelessly outgunned"" by the Canadian companies' lawyers and lobbyists looking to exploit the country's pot-paradise image, said Rolles, the analyst.

40,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,"Achiuwa scores 25, No. 16 Memphis holds off Ole Miss 87-86",,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - The 16th-ranked Memphis Tigers already knew they would have to play a long stretch without James Wiseman, their top freshman. Then another freshman, Lester Quinones, went to the locker room with an undisclosed injury after playing less than nine minutes against Mississippi.","Good thing coach Penny Hardaway has other a handful of very talented freshmen. Precious Achiuwa scored 25 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, while D.J. Jeffries added 23, including a dunk with a second left as Memphis held off the Rebels, 87-86, on Saturday for its third consecutive victory without Wiseman. ""To have a 16-point lead on a really well-coached team that has veteran guards and veteran players, I mean that's amazing for us,"" Hardaway said of this win. ""We will grow from this. We cannot go backward from this point forward with our energy and our understanding of what we're trying to do. But it's huge for us not to have Lester and James in there and be able to do that."" Blake Hinson beat the buzzer with a 3 for the final margin after Ole Miss (4-1) had trailed by as much as 16 in the second half. ""At the end, couldn't make a play when we needed to,"" Ole Miss coach Kermit Davis said. ""But good college game in November."" Memphis (5-1) snapped a three-game streak by Ole Miss in this series. Hardaway has the youngest team in the country, according to KenPom.com. He still has the No. 1 recruiting class even with Wiseman sitting out an NCAA-mandated 12-game suspension for what college sports' governing body ruled were impermissible benefits from 2017 when the Memphis coach was overseeing a local high school team. Achiuwa also was a five-star recruit like Wiseman. He helped Memphis score the final seven points to take 45-38 halftime lead. Then the 6-foot-9 forward scored the first seven for Memphis in the second half, then the Tigers pushed their lead to 54-43 on a dunk by Jeffries with 15:57 to go. The Tigers led 64-48 on a putback by Achiuwa with 11:19 left. ""The rest of the team just has to step up and make up for James not being here and not being able to play,"" Achiuwa said. Ole Miss responded with a 17-6 run to turn a runaway into a thrilling finish. With 5 seconds left and Memphis up 85-82, Breein Tyree thought he'd gotten a shot off when fouled by Tyler Harris. Officials sent Tyree to the line for two free throws instead of 3. Tyree split the free throws before Jeffries' dunk. ""It was kind of a bang-bang play,"" Davis said. Davis has three starters back for Ole Miss from his NCAA Tournament team last season. Tyree led Ole Miss with 24 points. KJ Buffen had a team-high 13 before fouling out with 10:10 left, and Hinson had 15. Harris had 15 and Alex Lomax 14 for Memphis. BIG PICTURE Ole Miss: The Rebels held each of their first four opponents below 60 points and led the SEC by allowing just 31.9% shooting, which was fourth nationally. They had little answer for Memphis' inside scoring except for getting into foul trouble. ... Their 3-pointers fell early as they hit five of their first six for an early lead. The Rebels finished 12 of 27 from 3. Memphis: The young Tigers are very good with layups and high-flying dunks, outscoring Ole Miss 52-20 in the paint. But they're going to have to show at some point they can take, and make, 3s to keep opponents from packing the paint defensively. They hit only 3 of 11 outside the arc, with Harris hitting all three. ACHUIWA'S GAME Hardaway says he had a long talk with Achiuwa on Friday with the freshman wanting to score more early this season. Against Ole Miss, Achiuwa came through with five defensive rebounds. He also had three turnovers but three steals and two blocks. ""I know who he could be and where he wants to go,"" Hardaway said. ""Where he wants to go, he has to do the things like he did today. He locked in and never took his eyes off of it from the beginning of the game until the end. It showed who he really is to the country.""

Durgin, 30, of Sandwich pleaded guilty in Plymouth Superior Court to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and leaving the scene of an accident with personal injury, District Attorney Timothy J. Cruz's office said in a statement. ""This heroic first responder was doing his job protecting the public safety and setting up a roadblock during a snowstorm when his life was forever changed,"" the statement said. Durgin was sentenced to serve up to 3 1/2 years in state prison and 2 1/2 years in a house of correction, according to the statement. During a snowstorm in March 2018, Onset firefighters were assisting Wareham police in closing off an area near Cranberry Highway at Onset Avenue, where severe winds had blown sheet metal onto the roadway, according to the statement. Durgin barreled his vehicle through the traffic cones, striking an Onset firefighter with such force that he was thrown 40 feet, the district attorney's office said. Durgin fled the scene, the statement said. The firefighter was transported to Rhode Island Hospital with life-threatening injuries, according to the statement. The firefighters and police officers were wearing a reflective vests at the time of the incident. Wareham police, acting on a tip that Durgin was staying at a motel in Centerville, found his car, a silver sedan with damage consistent with a collision.

43,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",PATRIOTS,,Patriots linebacker Jamie Collins has all the right moves,,,"FOXBOROUGH - Jamie Collins can make your jaw drop and eyes pop. Whether he's eyeing his target presnap or performing his latest acrobatic stunt, the Patriots linebacker is always someone to train your peepers on. Part Dick Butkus, part Gumby, and part Flying Wallenda, Collins is a leading force behind the NFL's best defense and he's also the leading entertainer at New England's practices. Whether it's a back flip off a blocking sled, walking on his hands during stretching, or jumping over the line of scrimmage from a standing position to block a punt, Collins is always pulling off head-shaking moves. He said the inspiration for many of his antics comes from childhood memories of messing around with his late brother Fred, whom he affectionately referred to as ""FC.""","FULL TEXT ""Man, sometimes I'm just in my own little world and I just do stuff. I was taught a long time ago how to do a lot of those things by my brother,'' Collins said Friday. ""Whenever I get time or whenever I'm bored, I just do little stuff like that, man, it's kind of fun. I like to have fun. I had a lot of fun growing up. You know, I'm a country boy, so stuff like that, that's how we survived.'' Collins, who grew up in McCall Creek, Miss., explained there weren't as many entertainment options available back then, so they created their own. ""You had to find something to have fun. We played a lot of sports. We raced on feet, we wrassled, we slap boxed, we had to find anything to have fun, so that's what we did,'' Collins said. ""We had to keep busy, we didn't play any video games, we didn't have social media. So, we had to get outside and do something, we had to go outside and be active. It's just one of those things I loved doing. I loved tumbling, I loved doing stuff like that.'' Collins regularly catches teammates, staff, and opponents off guard with his moves - and he'll even surprise himself. ""Oh, yeah. For sure, for sure,'' he said. ""It's not something that I just practice, I just do it. I just go.'' Collins has also saved some of his most impressive feats for game action. He leads the Patriots with 47 tackles and a half-dozen sacks. The 6-foot-3-inch, 255-pounder also has three interceptions (including a pick-six), two forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery. His play through 10 games in his second stint in New England has thrust him into the conversation for defensive player of the year. ""I mean, it's pretty cool, man,'' said Collins. ""But that ain't nothing I'm harping on. I just put my head down and work, man, and whatever comes, comes. That's bigger than me. I just come in here every day and work and hope and pray for the best.'' Already armed with a solid base of knowledge from his three-plus seasons in the New England defense, Collins has thrived in his return. He said there's been some subtle scheme changes that have really made a difference for him. ""There's a lot of different stuff going on, you know, you don't do the same stuff every year,'' he said. ""That's football, man, you've got to adjust and adapt and do your best, that's what we get paid to do.'' Collins said this Patriots unit is the best defense he's ever been a part of, though they don't spend a lot of time thinking about their place in history. New England has allowed 108 points through 10 games. The record for fewest points allowed in a 16-game slate is 165. ""We can definitely be one [of the best] as long as we keep going and doing what we're doing, hopefully we can and we'll see in the end,'' said Collins. ""It's nothing that we're shooting for, but as long as you're out there having fun, hopefully everything will work itself out.'' He said by no means has this defense peaked. ""You know, we've got a lot of depth. We've got a lot of good players, a lot of smart players,'' Collins said. ""We've got a lot of guys that are committed to the details and everybody is committed to one another, they love playing for one another. As long as we keep the brotherhood going and the camaraderie going, I think we'll be pretty damn good.'' The Patriots' linebacking corps has become known as the ""Boogeymen,"" a moniker that Dont'a Hightower said Collins conjured up one day. Collins said he's not so sure. ""Honestly, we was at practice stretching one day. We were just talking noise, I think it was me, Dont'a, and [Jerod] Mayo - it might have been Mayo [that coined the phrase],'' said Collins. ""It was really just us BS-ing around. I don't even know. Somebody took it and ran with it, I don't even know."" The Boogeymen name has taken off, spawning signs, T-shirts, and sweat shirts everywhere the team goes. ""It has gotten pretty big. It's cool,"" said Collins. ""It's not something we planned on, it just happened. We definitely appreciate it, we're forever grateful.'' Along with being grateful, Collins said this season has been his happiest time as a pro. ""I'm always trying to be that way. I'm blessed. Doing something that I'm pretty sure millions of people would love to be doing,'' he said. ""I'm not mad at all. Definitely, definitely blessed.'' Collins and his fellow Boogeymen will be back in action on Sunday against the Cowboys when they'll try to put the brakes on Ezekiel Elliott, a scary man in his own right. ""Man, he's a great back. He's an every-down back. You don't get those guys often - he's very rare in this league. He's one of those guys,'' said Collins. ""He can catch the ball out of the backfield, he can run it up the middle, he can spin out wide and give you a route. With him, you've just got to be prepared for everything.''

Dobbins rushed for 157 yards and two touchdowns and No. 2 Ohio State locked up the Big Ten East title Saturday, surviving its first real test of the season with a 28-17 victory over No. 9 Penn State.","The Buckeyes held on after Penn State (9-2, 7-2 Big Ten) took advantage of two second-half turnovers to climb back into the game in the third quarter after trailing 21-0. This was a far different scenario for Ohio State, which blew out its first 10 opponents. ""From the beginning to the end, you couldn't take a deep breath at all,"" Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. The Buckeyes (10-0, 8-0 Big Ten) were clinging to a 21-17 lead early in the fourth quarter when Justin Fields threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Chris Olave to create some space. The Ohio State defense, with Chase Young back from a two-game suspension, then shut down two late Penn State drives on fourth down. The last drive included back-to-back sacks of backup quarterback Will Levis by Young and linebacker Baron Browning. Fields fumbled away the ball twice, once as he was crossing the goal line for an apparent touchdown. But he got critical yards on the ground, rushing for 68 yards on 21 carries and threw beautiful second half touchdown passes to K.J. Hill and Olave. ""The biggest difference was the quarterback's legs, the running game,"" Penn State coach James Franklin said. Dobbins was responsible for both first-half touchdowns, a 4-yard plunge in the first quarter and a 2-yard plunge on fourth-and-goal with 2 minutes left in the half. He finished the first half with 89 rushing yards. With three sacks, Young now has 16.5 for the season. THE TAKEAWAY Penn State: Backup quarterback Levis provided a spark when he entered for the injured Sean Clifford, running for a 1-yard touchdown in the third quarter to pull his team within a touchdown. Statistically, the Nittany Lions were beaten soundly but managed to hang around until late. Journey Brown ran the ball 11 time for 64 yards.

For Aras Kaya, it was the validation of years of steadfast work in and out of practice, striving to get to this moment at the pinnacle of high school athletics.","FULL TEXT In an entertaining MIAA Division 2 boys' soccer final Saturday morning, Winchester pulled out a pulsating 5-4 overtime victory over Milford at Worcester State on a goal by Kaya off a re-start kick in the seventh minute of the first OT period. It was the program's first title since 1987. ""I worked so hard for this moment,"" said Kaya, an 18-year-old senior forward through tears after the game. ""I didn't even make the tryouts for two years. My junior year I had to really, really work hard to play. My junior year summer I just grinded it out and I just worked so hard to get that starting spot. ""And I finally did. I can't be more proud of this team."" Winchester coach Vin Musto said Kaya earned every bit of achievement. ""He's someone who just puts hours and hours into his craft outside of the team,"" Musto said. ""He's an absolute sponge of information. He made adjustments and found himself in the right place and it was a great finish. I couldn't be more proud."" Kaya finished off what was a balanced attack, with three players connecting for Winchester (15-3-5). Junior forward Diego Diaz scored twice, and senior midfielder William Hofheinz tallied two goals and an assist. ""From day one we said this is a complete team and we're never going to lean on one player,"" Musto said. ""It was total 80 minutes that everybody contributed. They could've crumbled and they stayed tough."" The game was certainly a mental test for both sides. Milford led two separate times and neither team ever led by more than one. The game featured nine total goals and the Sachems had to rebound from Milford tying the game with less than seven minutes left in regulation. Milford (18-1-2) received two goals from senior Pedro Araujo, one from junior Joao Pedro Da Silva, and the late tying goal from senior Leonardo Terrinha. ""This was the craziest game I've been a part of,"" Kaya said.

46,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",WORLD,,Argentine bishop says he'll return to face sex allegations,,,"Link to Image BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - An Argentine bishop close to Pope Francis said Saturday he'll return voluntarily to Argentina to respond to prosecutors' accusations of sex abuse.","Javier Belda Iniesta, the canon law lawyer for Bishop Gustavo Zanchetta issued a statement that the monsignor would arrive in Argentina on Tuesday and would fully cooperate with authorities. Zanchetta has been formally accused of ""aggravated continuous sexual abuse"" of two seminarians, charges that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He has denied the charges. The Zanchetta case is particularly grave for Francis, given the pope was aware of allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by his onetime protégé in 2015, two years before Zanchetta resigned as bishop of Oran. Francis allowed him to step down in 2017 for ""health reasons,"" but then named him to a senior Vatican administration position a few months later. Francis acknowledged in a TV interview earlier this year that he asked Zanchetta about the initial accusation, involving nude selfies on the bishop's cellphone. The pope said he gave Zanchetta the benefit of the doubt after he claimed his phone had been hacked. Belda Iniesta stressed that judges had rejected requests by Argentine prosecutor María Soledad Filtrín for an international arrest warrant. He also insisted the bishop believes the prosecutor's actions were aimed only at learning the truth, ""even when they could seem compulsive or repetitive without apparent motive."" The Vatican insists the first accusation of actual sex abuse was only lodged against Zanchetta in late 2018. But The Associated Press and the newspaper Tribune of Salta have reported that documents and testimony from diocesan officials raised credible allegations of inappropriate sexual misconduct well before then. Zanchetta is also facing a canonical trial. The allegations do not involve minors. Argentine prosecutors said last week that an order for Zanchetta's capture had been requested because the bishop did not answer repeated phone calls or emails to be notified of the legal process against him. The attorney's statement Saturday said the bishop has been at the ""residence indicated to judicial authorities."" That appeared to confirm that Zanchetta has been lodging at the same Vatican hotel, the Santa Marta, at which the pope stays.",['ENGLISH'],390,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-LYQLPQDBFBE2TGPGQUIJ33CDQM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DNVT', 'className': 'ABUSE & NEGLECT'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000A0RH', 'className': 'CATHOLICS & CATHOLICISM'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Sex Crimes'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFENzYyRUI3RjFENEUwOEIyN0U0NEZBQjE5RjExMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc', 'className': 'Sexual Assault'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001464', 'className': 'RELIGION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N922130TM', 'className': 'PUBLIC PROSECUTORS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000309', 'className': 'CLERGY & RELIGIOUS VOCATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DIFM', 'className': 'CATHOLIC POPES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST00098X6', 'className': 'SEX & GENDER ISSUES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0008XAK', 'className': 'SEXUAL BEHAVIOR'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTg1QUIzNkIwNzk5NDQ4NzhGMDdDQjVGNEYyRjY5OTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURENzJGNTEyQzM0NEREQUI2RkVCRTM4RTc1RTZBREU', 'className': 'Judges'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0008XMR', 'className': 'LAW & LEGAL SYSTEM'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODVCRjhDNURBRDYzNDAzNjlFMDA3ODgyMUQ0ODhDRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkzMEJFRkNCRUQwNEIyOEE3QTBDOEFFM0ZDRDg0NzU', 'className': 'Arrests'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjdFQTZCOEY3MkQ1NDc3Qzk1OTg3RDAyQjY4OEI3N0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM5QzgwQzJDRkFDNDUwM0IxQTdBRjUyODFDN0U0Q0Y', 'className': 'Testimony'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001480', 'className': 'RESIGNATIONS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001149', 'className': 'MISCONDUCT'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEYwNDJCRjA5QjlCNEYyNzkxNDdBRTkzNkQxMjAxMUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODVCRjhDNURBRDYzNDAzNjlFMDA3ODgyMUQ0ODhDRjE', 'className': 'Warrants'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000A4J3', 'className': 'JAIL SENTENCING'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST000DGUM', 'className': 'PHONE HACKING'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST000DFF5', 'className': 'SELFIES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST000DGUM', 'className': 'PHONE HACKING'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST000A0Z7', 'className': 'MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST000DFF5', 'className': 'SELFIES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'N721110GM', 'className': 'HOTELS & MOTELS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001704', 'className': 'TELEVISION PROGRAMMING'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DAZW', 'className': 'POPE FRANCIS I'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX009', 'className': 'BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA'}], 'country': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC337', 'className': 'ARGENTINA'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'GC300', 'className': 'HOLY SEE'}]}"

(AP) - Virginia wasn't hitting its long-range shots against Massachusetts and the Cavaliers' best player was on the bench for almost half of the game. But Braxton Key scored 16 points and Virginia used its stifling defense to hand UMass its first loss of the season, 58-46, on Saturday in the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament.","Kihei Clark added 14 points and Jay Huff chipped in with 10 points and eight rebounds for the defending national champions (5-0), who limited the Minutemen to just 15 baskets and 30% shooting. ""We know we can be in any game with any team,"" Key said. ""We haven't found our rhythm yet shooting the ball this year. I don't think we've had a game where we shot the ball really well. But we're going to keep digging and keep playing defense really and we'll figure it out."" Carl Pierre had 14 points and T.J. Weeks added 12 for Massachusetts (5-1). UMass scored 11 straight points to close the first half and trailed just 29-24 at halftime after Tre Mitchell made layups on three straight trips down the court. They cut that deficit to three points after a short jumper from Pierre to open the second half. But the Cavaliers began double-teaming Mitchell, who scored all 10 of his points before intermission, and held UMass to four points over the next 14 minutes. ""In the second half, we challenged the guys and did a good job,"" coach Tony Bennett said. ""We put Braxton on Mitchell and Mamadi (Diakite) came quicker on the post trap. They did get some good open shots out of it, but I thought we tightened up for stretches and we were stingier defensively."" A dunk by Diakite on a lob from Clark highlighted the run that put Virginia in control at 49-33. Key had Virginia's first two baskets and 11 of his points in the first half. He also closed the scoring with a breakaway dunk. UMass tried to speed up the pace, opening the game with a trapping press. But the Minutemen made just three of their first 14 shots. ""Tonight, we just weren't hitting our shots, that's all it is,"" said Pierre, who was just 2 of 10 from 3-point range. ""We hit those shots, I think it's an interesting game. I definitely think we could have come out on top, too."" Diakite, who came in averaging just under 16 points a game, scored only four points in 21 minutes. He played three minutes in the first half, picking up his second foul 8½ minutes into the game and didn't score his first basket until eight minutes into the second half. But the 7-foot-1 Huff picked up the slack. He hit five of his eight shots. The Cavaliers' defense held UMass without a field goal for six minutes in the opening half. They led 29-13 after a 3-pointer from Casey Morsell, before UMass responded with its big run. STATS OF THE GAME. Massachusetts had just four assists for the game, while holding the Cavaliers to nine and neither team shot well from 3-point range. UMass made just 5 of its 26 shots from behind the arc. Virginia was 2 of 14. ""A couple of them may have been bad shots, but for the most part, we got open looks,"" UMass coach Matt McCall said. ""We have all the confidence in the world in our guys when the ball leaves their hands. (If we make them) now you look down at the stat sheet and we have 15, 16 assists instead of four."" Virginia outscored UMass in the paint 30-18. ILLNESS Virginia is playing this tournament without sophomore guard Kody Stattmann, who is back in Charlottesville with what Bennett described as a virus, which also kept him out of the victory over Vermont. ""We'll do his blood work and make sure it's going in the right direction and we can get him back sooner hopefully than later, but we're obviously going to let the doctors take good care of him,"" Bennett said. BIG PICTURE UMass: The Minutemen had scored at least 80 points in the past three games and came in averaging 78.4 points per game. Virginia: The Cavaliers have won the past six November tournaments they entered and are 137-36 in nonconference games under Bennett. UP NEXT UMass: The Minutemen will play St. John's in Sunday's third-place game. Virginia: The Cavaliers will play for the championship on Sunday against Arizona State, which beat the Red Storm 80-67. ""We're going to have to make shots,"" said St. John's coach Bobby Hurley. ""They're one of the best defensive teams in the country, and with their pace of play it's going to be a real contrast in style, obviously."" ___ More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and            https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",['ENGLISH'],764,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-U7SG227SAZDZPEYFWD42U5XEFQ,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Business & Corporate Compliance', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}], 'state': [{'score': '72', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}]}"
48,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,"His White House engulfed, Trump keeps California in the crosshairs",,,"Link to Image WASHINGTON - President Trump has never been one to dive into the details of policy, especially now, as an impeachment inquiry threatens to engulf his administration. In recent days, he has allowed his son-in-law to lead a major policy shift in the Middle East and has backed away from a high-profile promise to ban flavored e-cigarettes. But even as his presidency teeters, one of the few policy issues that has maintained Trump's personal focus is not one central to his political appeal, like immigration or trade.","FULL TEXT It is the state of California. The state has been a political fixation since the early days of his presidency, but that was heightened this autumn. Trump has attended meetings, asked detailed questions at briefings, and pressed aides to find ways to use policies to go after the most populous state in the union, according to three people familiar with the matter. Aides say that Trump remains deeply involved on immigration policy, like a recent decision to slash the nation's refugee program nearly in half, and on trade. But they describe him as obsessed with narrow policies that directly affect California. Beyond those three policy matters, little else has penetrated the swirl of impeachment. Two Californians, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Adam B. Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, are leading the impeachment investigation. The state's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, has been unsparing in his criticism and his legal challenges. And the president's response appears to be personal. Beyond the name-calling - ""Shifty"" Adam Schiff and ""Nervous Nancy"" Pelosi - he has held California Democrats responsible even for the state's natural disasters. ""The Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, has done a terrible job of forest management,"" Trump wrote on Twitter this month, adding a threat: ""Every year, as the fire's rage & California burns, it is the same thing - and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor."" Newsom's ex-wife, Kimberly Guilfoyle, now a Trump campaign adviser and girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., has joined in the criticism on Twitter and at campaign events. And the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, has often counseled Trump on the politics of his state. In a statement, a White House spokesman, Judd Deere, said, ""California leaders continue to support destructive liberal policies that kill jobs, increase housing costs, provide sanctuary to criminal illegal aliens, and ignore longtime environmental issues."" Newsom appears to relish responding. ""We are the countervailing influence on climate change. We expose his folly,"" Newsom said in a recent interview. ""We embarrass him."" The cause of the recent bad blood appears to have been a secret deal that the governor brokered over the summer with Ford and three other major automakers, under which the companies agreed to comply with tighter climate pollution rules set by the state, defying Trump's national effort to roll back federal regulations on tailpipe emissions. The announcement of the deal enraged Trump, three people familiar with the matter say. Since the beginning of his presidency, Trump has been enthusiastic about his administration's push to roll back Obama-era rules on climate-warming auto pollution, framing it as a signature move to save an iconic industry from burdensome red tape. For most of that earlier period, Trump stayed away from the complex regulatory details involved in undoing the regulation, according to two current and two former White House officials. That changed with Newsom's deal with the automakers. Suddenly Trump was delving into policy details. The administration and Justice Department have pushed an unusual series of legal and policy moves against California and the auto companies that backed the state's climate change plan. Last month, the Justice Department filed suit to force the state to drop Quebec from its central effort to limit greenhouse gases from power plants, arguing that a state could not conduct foreign policy. In September, the Environmental Protection Agency threatened to withhold federal highway funding from California if it did not address a decadeslong backlog of air pollution control plans. Also in September, the administration opened an antitrust investigation into the four automakers that sided with California over Trump in the dispute over fuel efficiency standards. When aides told Trump that the final details of his rollback of the auto emissions rule would most likely not be completed before the end of this year, he demanded faster action. Officials at the EPA and the Department of Transportation responded by separating out California's portion of the rule and releasing it in September. Trump announced the new rule on Twitter while in Los Angeles for a fund-raiser. Then, Trump said aboard Air Force One that his administration would issue a notice of environmental violation against San Francisco because of its homelessness problem. Barry Rabe, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan who is writing a book about the history of the state-federal relationship, said there were no historical parallels for the president's obsession. ""I cannot think of another president who sustained a political jihad against a specific state,"" he said.",['ENGLISH'],925,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-MCEGETANKEI6VAYBDQ2CCYGPI4,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Environmental Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjU1Q0FGMTcyM0M5NDQzMkIxQ0Y0NUFFQ0VGRjQ0MjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDEwQTI5QTZCNDQ4NEM2MUI3NTM4MUYzMDgyRDQwQzE', 'className': 'Contracts Clause'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCX', 'className': 'US DEMOCRATIC PARTY'}, {'score': '86', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9C', 'className': 'GOVERNORS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001960', 'className': 'PUBLIC POLICY'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DLYQ', 'className': 'IMMIGRATION REGULATION & POLICY'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Governments'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Immigration'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX000887', 'className': 'IMMIGRATION'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUM5ODIzNEVDM0VCNDU1OTkyMDZCRUU1Q0ZCMzM4NDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0VDRDc0NDNBMjkwNDJBMEFCOUNGMTU1QzFBRTIyMTk', 'className': 'Refugee Status'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'STX001197', 'className': 'NATURAL DISASTERS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001963', 'className': 'SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'ST000DDOC', 'className': 'ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '52', 'classCode': 'ST000DDOC', 'className': 'ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES'}], 'person': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'PE000DN7U', 'className': 'GAVIN NEWSOM'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'PE0009WKA', 'className': 'NANCY PELOSI'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'PE000A0TQ', 'className': 'ADAM B SCHIFF'}], 'state': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GR132', 'className': 'MIDDLE EAST'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
49,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,UK Labour Party leader Corbyn defends neutral Brexit stance,,,Link to Image Link to Image LONDON (AP) - Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is defending his decision to remain neutral in a possible future referendum on Britain's membership in the European Union.,"Corbyn said Saturday that he plans to be an ""honest broker"" in a Brexit referendum rather than urge voters to remain in the EU or leave under terms of a new deal he would negotiate if he becomes prime minister after the Dec. 12 election. He said at a campaign event in Sheffield that ""my role as the Labour prime minister would be to ensure that is carried out in a fair way ... and that I will carry out the result of that referendum."" Corbyn announced Friday night he would be neutral, a position assailed Saturday by political rivals on both sides of the Brexit divide. He had been repeatedly challenged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to clarify his Brexit plan. Labour's position is more complex than the unabashedly pro-Brexit policy espoused by Johnson and his Conservatives, who seek to win parliamentary approval for the deal already negotiated in order to leave the EU by Jan. 31. Corbyn says if he comes to power, Labour will negotiate a new deal with EU officials, then put that new deal to voters, who can choose between endorsing it or staying inside the 28-nation EU bloc. He says he plans to let voters decide the proposed referendum without him taking a position as prime minister. That view was ridiculed on the campaign trail Saturday. Liberal Democratic leader Jo Swinson called it a total abdication of the prime minister's responsibility. Her party has vowed to halt Brexit by revoking Article 50, which triggered Britain's withdrawal process. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who advocates an immediate, final break with the EU, said the Labour Party is ""bombing"" with voters because of Corbyn's vague position. Johnson pushed for Britain to hold the December election, which is taking place more than two years early, in hopes of winning a majority and breaking Britain's political impasse over Brexit. All 650 seats in the House of Commons are up for grabs. ___ Follow AP's full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit",['ENGLISH'],360,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-TRLN4HBBHFBY5PAHZ65C2KVJPM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DKY8', 'className': 'BREXIT'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0Y2REExMDg3NTBBNDJDNDk0MzcwNDc1RTNEMUIyQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0M3QUYzNjlBN0UzNEVBMDk4OEIyMzdBMDlGQzA2RjI', 'className': 'Initiative & Referendum'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000D73F', 'className': 'EUROPEAN UNION'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N921110CC', 'className': 'HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009EOQ', 'className': 'PRIME MINISTERS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DLQX', 'className': 'UK LABOUR PARTY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DLPE', 'className': 'UK POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001812', 'className': 'VOTERS & VOTING'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DH1Z', 'className': 'UK GENERAL ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Governments'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DLRH', 'className': 'UK LIBERAL DEMOCRATS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000D1F7', 'className': 'BRITISH PARLIAMENT'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N921100GM', 'className': 'EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX000949', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'STX000108', 'className': 'APPROVALS'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DH1G', 'className': 'NIGEL FARAGE'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000A0IC', 'className': 'BORIS JOHNSON'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DKC9', 'className': 'JEREMY CORBYN'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX106', 'className': 'LONDON, ENGLAND'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC329', 'className': 'UNITED KINGDOM'}, {'score': '92', 'classCode': 'ST00099QF', 'className': 'EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GT115', 'className': 'EUROPE'}]}"
50,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,"Evans scores 3 TDs, No. 23 App State tops Texas State 35-13",,,Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image,"Link to Image BOONE, N.C. (AP) - Darrynton Evans ran for 154 yards and three second-half touchdowns and No. 23 Appalachian State avoided another home upset with a big second half to beat Texas State 35-13 on a rain-soaked Saturday. Zac Thomas threw for 174 yards and two touchdowns to help the Mountaineers (10-1, 6-1 Sun Belt) improve to 30-6 at home since becoming an FBS team in 2014. Texas State entered the game as a 30 1/2-point underdog, but trailed only 14-13 midway through the third quarter, and most fans at Kidd Brewer Stadium were probably thinking about Georgia Southern's 24-21 upset over then-20th-ranked Appalachian State three weeks ago on this same field. But linebacker Noel Cook turned the momentum when he intercepted a tipped pass in Texas State territory, setting up a 13-yard TD run around right end by Evans. Evans would add touchdown runs of 10 and 13 yards to give 14 TDs on the season to put the game away. Tyler Vitt threw for 154 yards and a touchdown for Texas State (3-8, 2-5). Thomas got the Mountaineers going early, connecting on a 45-yard TD strike down the middle to wide receiver Corey Sutton, who got a step on three defenders and stretched out to make an over-the-shoulder catch in the end zone. But Sutton, the team's leader in yards receiving and TDs receiving, left the game with a knee injury after fumbling in the second quarter and it seemed to take the Mountaineers a while to adjust. POLL IMPLICATIONS: A close win over Texas State isn't exactly going to impress the voters, but the Mountaineers still could potentially move up in the polls. Appalachian State was previously ranked No. 20 this season, its highest ranking ever. THE TAKEAWAY Texas State: This was a solid showing for the Bobcats for the first 2 1/2 quarters, particularly on defense against a Mountaineers team that came in ranked 21st in the country in scoring offense. But a penalty for illegal hands to the face nullified a third down stop, giving Appalachian State new life on offense. Appalachian State: The injury to Sutton could be problematic moving forward for the Mountaineers. Sutton was on the sideline in crutches after the game. The Mountaineers will have to rely more on Western Michigan graduate transfer Keishawn Watson, who had a 19-yard touchdown reception, his first with the school. UP NEXT Texas State: Wraps up the season next Saturday at Coastal Carolina. Appalachian State: Can wrap up Sun Belt Eastern Division championship with a win at Troy on Friday night. ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and            https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",['ENGLISH'],454,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-AZ7Z3J7EABDILNJNGNZFH7G2XI,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0009SE3', 'className': 'STADIUMS & ARENAS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000126', 'className': 'ATHLETES'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000CFE3', 'className': 'SPORTS FANS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'STX001347', 'className': 'POLLS & SURVEYS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000C47H', 'className': 'WOUNDS & INJURIES'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000A6SC', 'className': 'KNEE DISORDERS & INJURIES'}], 'state': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GS159', 'className': 'TEXAS, USA'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'GS126', 'className': 'GEORGIA, USA'}]}"

""We are finding here hundreds of objects,"" said Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Anany. ""All of them are very interesting from the Egyptological point of view to know better this area."" The Saqqara plateau hosted at least 11 pyramids, including the Step Pyramid, along with hundreds of tombs of ancient officials, ranging from the 1st Dynasty (2920-2770 BC) to the Coptic period (395-642). Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters that local archaeologists found a cache that includes hundreds of mummified animals, birds, and crocodiles. He said that among the mummified animals were two lion cubs and radar scans were needed on three others to determine that the mummies were also lions. Archaeologists frequently find mummified cats but the recovery of a lion is rare. In 2004, the first lion skeleton was found in Saqqara, revealing the sacred status of the animal in ancient times. Archeologists also found wooden and bronze cat statues representing the ancient goddess Bastet and a rare large stone scarab, which Waziri described as ""the largest all over the world."" They also displayed two mummies of ichneumon, or the Egyptian mongoose, wrapped in linen bandages and wooden and tin-glazed statuettes of the goddess Sekhmet, represented as a woman with the head of a lioness. Scholars say Sekhmet (1390-1252 BC) was a goddess of war and the destroyer of the enemies of the sun god Re. There were also strips of papyrus with depictions of the goddess Taweret depicted as a hippopotamus with the tail of a crocodile. Markings on the displayed artifacts show that they date to the Late Period (664-332 BC). The Saqqara discovery is the latest in a series of new finds that Egypt has sought to publicize in an effort to revive its key tourism sector, which was badly hit by the turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak.",['ENGLISH'],419,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-A6EBDYQOEMI6VK2QUEAUNBWRKU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX000264', 'className': 'WILD CATS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000CFER', 'className': 'ANIMALS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009TS7', 'className': 'ANTHROPOLOGY & ARCHAEOLOGY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000A1LF', 'className': 'ARCHAEOLOGY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000A3EZ', 'className': 'CATS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D78I', 'className': 'REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST00099LP', 'className': 'CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000DEE1', 'className': 'ANCIENT HISTORY'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX002143', 'className': 'SCULPTURE'}], 'person': [{'score': '56', 'classCode': 'PE000A0TK', 'className': 'HOSNI MUBARAK'}], 'city': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'GX102', 'className': 'CAIRO, EGYPT'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC332', 'className': 'EGYPT'}]}"

53,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",WORLD,,French officials: Nun's attire allowed in retirement home,"Earlier decision held that habit, veil violated law",,"PARIS - A Catholic nun who was told she could stay in a retirement home in France only if she stopped wearing religious clothing was wronged, French officials say, in a case that they say misinterpreted the country's laws prohibiting religious attire in some public spaces. The nun, who is older than 70 and has not been publicly identified, had been living in a convent in southeastern France when she decided to retire in Haute-Saône, her native region farther north.","FULL TEXT Her application to live in a unit in a publicly funded retirement home in Vesoul, a town about 55 miles northeast of Dijon, was accepted in July. But the home, which is run by the local authorities, specified that she would have to accommodate the other residents by not wearing her religious habit or veil. In a letter sent to the nun, and seen this week by the news outlet Agence France-Presse, the retirement home told her that ""all ostentatious signs of belonging to a religious community cannot be accepted in order to guarantee everyone's serenity."" ""Religion is a private matter and must remain so,"" the letter said. The nun did not agree to go without her habit, and the local parish helped her rent a private apartment instead. Officials now say that the retirement home wrongly applied France's secularism laws, and Alain Chrétien, the mayor of Vesoul, apologized in a statement Tuesday. ""This error of judgment is very regrettable,"" Chrétien said, adding that he was ""personally"" committed to finding the nun a spot in a public retirement home if she so wished. France has faced numerous heated debates over the place of religion in society in recent years, centered on the concept of laïcité, a policy of state secularism that first emerged during the French Revolution and took form in the 19th century, culminating in a landmark 1905 law on the separation of church and state. A cultural aversion to public expressions of all faiths still holds strong, but in recent years, it has focused on Muslim attire, especially women wearing head scarves. Recently, a local politician asked a Muslim mother on a school trip in Dijon to remove her hijab, igniting weeks of vitriolic nationwide debate. The nun's case had gone unnoticed until this week, when the Rev. Florent Belin, the parish priest in Vesoul, mentioned her in his monthly newsletter, lamenting that she had been forced to find her own apartment. ""People harp on with principles of laïcité that are not understood,"" Belin wrote. ""Old demons, mismanaged fears are blocking situations."" This week, Claude Ferry, the head of the public organization that manages the retirement home, told France Bleu, a network of local radio stations, that the nun had declined the spot in the home because she ""did not want to accept the rules, which are the same for everyone."" But French officials say those rules are a misguided use of France's national policy. Nicolas Cadène, a senior member of the Observatory of Secularism, an agency that helps the government enforce laïcité, said that France's religious neutrality restrictions applied only to state employees and other public servants on the job, not to the general public. Cadène said in a telephone interview that the nun's case was ""the very demonstration"" of a ""wrong interpretation of laïcité."" ""Under the rule of law, you don't ban something because it displeases this or that individual. You only ban it if it is objectively disturbing public order,"" he said. ""And that is obviously not the case when you have simple citizens who are wearing religious attire and who don't represent any public administrations."" Chrétien, the mayor of Vesoul, said in an interview published by the magazine Le Point on Wednesday that the retirement home's staff had committed a ""big blunder"" but that state employees were sometimes ""paralyzed"" when dealing with the ""inflammable"" issue of secularism. ""The topic is not consensual, because everyone has their own definition,"" he said. For Cadène, that is partly because debates over Muslims in France have led to a ""great confusion"" about secularism laws and have shifted public discourse toward a stricter understanding of laïcité. ""By constantly trying to extend neutrality, first by targeting a specific religion, it always winds up extending to other religions and beliefs,"" he said. ""It's a real danger.""",['ENGLISH'],765,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-VPEAD5QMSEI6VAYBDQ2CCYGPI4,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000309', 'className': 'CLERGY & RELIGIOUS VOCATIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001464', 'className': 'RELIGION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000296', 'className': 'CHURCH & STATE'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST00099LP', 'className': 'CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000A0RH', 'className': 'CATHOLICS & CATHOLICISM'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTdGM0NBMURGQ0JENDY1Q0JFQkM3NEE4QzJFNDEzMDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg', 'className': 'Freedom of Religion'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST00099LR', 'className': 'MUSLIMS & ISLAM'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9I', 'className': 'CITY GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001965', 'className': 'SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE'}], 'city': [{'score': '57', 'classCode': 'GX115', 'className': 'PARIS, FRANCE'}], 'state': [{'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GS0008X1V', 'className': 'FRANCHE-COMTE, FRANCE'}], 'country': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GC317', 'className': 'FRANCE'}]}"

55,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",HIGH SCHOOLS,,MIAA's playoff system means Thanksgiving Day rivalries don't matter as much as they used to,,,"Link to Image It is supposed to be the football highlight of a high school senior's life. You invest a great part of your youth playing football and it culminates in the annual Thanksgiving Day game against a century-old rival. Morning football jousts give way to afternoon turkey, stuffing, and canned cranberry sauce. The rest of the country has Friday Night Lights. Here in Massachusetts we have Turkey Day bragging rights. Sweet.","FULL TEXT But our ancient ritual has been modified and in many cases, severely diluted. This is not the fault of global warming, the Internet, or millennial apathy. The change in our traditional Thanksgiving football rivalry games is owed to changes in the MIAA state football playoff format. Massachusetts is home to most of the oldest football rivalries in High School America. And our jousts take place on Thanksgiving. Wellesley and Needham this week will play for the 132nd time, Barnstable and Falmouth for the 130th time, Winchester and Woburn for the 115th time. Swampscott and Marblehead have met 109 times. Ask anyone from Quincy if they think Quincy vs. North Quincy will be a big deal. Ditto for Boston Latin and Boston English, Newton North and Brookline. Unfortunately, playoff format changes imposed in 2013 have dented interest in the Thanksgiving game in many communities. Due to the current state playoff format, a 2019 Thanksgiving game might feature two teams who have already played this season; or worse: the Thanksgiving game can result in the farce if one squad decides not to compete because there's a Super Bowl coming up. Due to the current format, some teams have playoff games this weekend, five days before Thanksgiving. Which game would you try to win? ""We've played Foxborough 89 years in a row,'' says Mansfield coach Mike Redding, who is planning to go all out this Thursday even though his team is bound for a Division 2 Super Bowl. ""We want to be respectful, but you only get so many shots at a state championship. The good part for us is that we don't have to play the weekend before Thanksgiving. A lot of the schools do.'' Some Thanksgiving games have been ""tanked"" in recent years. In 2016, Duxbury was 11-0, ranked No. 1 in EMass going into its Thanksgiving game against Marshfield. Duxbury coaches elected to rest their starters for the following weekend's Super Bowl and lost on Thanksgiving to Marshfield, 53-0. The Dragons then won nine days later, beating Shrewsbury at Gillette Stadium, 40-7. In 2014, Holliston rested its starters against Westwood on Thanksgiving, lost 33-0, then won its Super Bowl, 43-0, the following week against Wahconah Regional at Gillette Stadium. Related: What's your school's Thanksgiving Day record? In 2013, the first year of this format, Redding watched Mansfield's best player, Brendan Hill, tear his ACL in a ""meaningless"" Thanksgiving rivalry game vs. Foxborough. Mansfield went on to win its Super Bowl anyway. ""In 2013, we asked our players, 'Do you want to play in this [Thanksgiving] game?' And every player said, 'We want to play. We don't want to lose our undefeated season.' But then Brendan tore his ACL and our best running back separated his shoulder. We don't have a game [the week before Thanksgiving] this year, so we are going to play Thanksgiving as a normal game.'' Jim O'Leary, chair of the MIAA's football committee, and a former AD and football coach at St. John's Prep says, ""I have a problem with coaches that don't coach or try to win the game and play their freshmen and lose, 42-0, but I understand why some people would do it. ""People very clearly don't want to get rid of Thanksgiving. We have to work around that and that's what we did. This isn't Texas or Western Pennsylvania. I think we have good perspective on football here. I would hate to see Thanksgiving go by the boards."" ""The games mean nothing now,'' says Mike Lynch, longtime Channel 5 sports anchor who has dedicated much programming to high school sports. Lynch played at Swampscott High and his late father was a longtime staff member under legendary Stan Bondelevich at Swampscott before serving as athletic director at Danvers High. ""Covering Thanksgiving games for Channel 5, we've been burned by going to games where teams played their JV players because they are going to be in the Super Bowl the following week,'' says Lynch. ""I can't imagine not playing in my Thanksgiving game. It's unthinkable. They'd have had to have chained me to the door to keep me from playing.'' Related: When are the 2019 high school Super Bowls? ""The crowds are a lot smaller,'' says Catholic Memorial coach John DiBiaso, who had a long career at Everett High with multiple state championships. ""At Everett, we used to play our Thanksgiving game at Harvard Stadium. It didn't matter what the records were. It was the last time the kids played together. Now it's a little different and it's a sin because this is unique to Massachusetts. This was a nice little thing we had.'' DiBiaso's CM squad has a chance to win a state championship on Dec. 7. Meanwhile, the Knights will play BC High Thursday, continuing a series that started in 1962. The Thanksgiving rivals already played Nov. 8 in a ""tournament"" game, with CM winning, 27-16. John Bartlett, who coached BC High for eight years and has been AD for 20 years, said, ""There's definitely been a drop in attendance for Thanksgiving. When you play them in the playoffs, then play them again two weeks later, there's not as much at stake. There are not as many fans attending. ""It's definitely a conundrum for the state. I understand and I like that there are more teams in the playoffs, but there's not as much at stake now. I can see how each side looks at this differently.'' BC High-CM will be one of nine 2019 Thanksgiving games that will be ""rematches.'' ""I was talking to one of my high school teammates the other day, and I asked him if he was going to the BC High-CM Thanksgiving game,"" said former Boston University hockey coach Jack Parker (CM '63). ""He thought I was incorrect about CM's opponent because CM already played BC High. He just moved back to Boston recently and didn't know about the new format. He was surprised at the weirdness of such a format. ""Am I the only one who thinks the system is ridiculous?"" Longtime Newton North athletic director Tom Giusti notes, ""Crowds for our Thanksgiving game have been down. It used to be that our game could be for the league championship, but that's gone now because of the format. We've already played Brookline in our first seven games. We could have played them again in the tournament. This could be our third game with them. And the game doesn't mean as much. The kids lose a little something when this happens. It's harder to motivate them.'' ""Thanksgiving is just not the same,'' argues Lynch. ""And it's a huge financial hit for some of these schools. When my dad was athletic director at Danvers, the gate from the Thanksgiving game would fund the entire winter sports program. Now it means nothing. The crowds have dwindled.

(AP) - Here's something else to add to the conversation for Chuba Hubbard's Heisman Trophy chances: The nation's rushing leader is a solid receiver, too. Hubbard set career highs with seven catches for 88 yards Saturday in No. 22 Oklahoma State's 20-13 win over West Virginia.","Oh, and the sophomore also surpassed 100 yards rushing for the ninth consecutive game to push his total to 1,832 yards. ""In the second half, we just started riding Chuba,"" said Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy. Hubbard and quarterback Dru Brown, who threw two touchdown passes in his first start, generated just enough offense for the Cowboys (8-3, 5-3 Big 12, No. 21 CFP), who won their fourth straight. Hubbard entered the game with 82 receiving yards all season and Gundy had emphasized earlier in the week he didn't throw to Hubbard that often out of fear of injury. But Gundy said West Virginia took away Hubbard's effectiveness on the ground early. ""It forced us into throwing the ball to him some, more so than him running,"" Gundy said. ""It worked out good for us."" Hubbard ran 46 yards with a screen pass to set up Oklahoma State's first touchdown. ""Chuba, he's the real deal,"" said West Virginia coach Neal Brown. ""I knew coming in he's a great player. I leave the game, he's a great player."" Hubbard said it doesn't matter how he gets the ball. ""I just try my best to get first downs and score,"" he said. ""I was just trying to do my job and make something happen."" Hubbard ran 26 times for 106 yards, far below his 173-yard average, but he ran for 47 yards on two key second-half drives that helped Oklahoma State take control. Dru Brown marched Oklahoma State the length of the field early in the fourth quarter, hitting Dillon Stoner with a 2-yard scoring pass for a 17-13 lead. ""I was really proud of Dru, the way he took care of the ball and didn't turn it over,"" Gundy said. West Virginia (4-7, 2-6) didn't have as much luck inside the red zone. The Mountaineers couldn't convert on three plays from the 1-yard line in the second quarter and they twice had to settle for short field goals. Leddie Brown converted a fourth-and-1 from the Oklahoma State 18 with 2:37 left in the game. But Jarret Doege threw three incompletions, the Mountaineers turned the ball over on downs and Oklahoma State ran out the clock. ""Just too many missed opportunities. That sums it up,"" Neal Brown said. ""Credit them. They made enough plays at the end of the game."" Doege finished 28 of 38 for 307 yards in his second start since taking over for Austin Kendall, including a 34-yard scoring toss in the second quarter to his roommate, George Campbell. Seven of Campbell's 19 receptions this season have gone for touchdowns. THE TAKEAWAY Oklahoma State: The Cowboys were outgained 333-285 but managed to make the most of it. Dru Brown, a graduate transfer from Hawaii, completed 22 of 29 passes for 196 yards in place of the injured Spencer Sanders. West Virginia: The Mountaineers lost for the sixth time in seven games and their bowl hopes are over. A defense that looked impressive against Hubbard in the first half gave him just enough room to break free after halftime and the offense was limited to 128 yards and three points after halftime. FAMILY FIRST Gundy stayed behind in Stillwater, Oklahoma, on Friday night to watch his son, Gunnar, win a state semifinal playoff game. Gunnar Gundy is a senior quarterback at Stillwater High School. ""Those are special times for me,"" Gundy said. ""I've missed a lot of his games. It's just not something I could pass up on."" Mike Gundy flew to West Virginia afterward to join his players and coaches. ""I bet half the guys didn't even know I wasn't there,"" he said. ""And if they can't take care of themselves for about seven or eight hours, we got serious issues."" POLL IMPLICATIONS The Cowboys could move up a spot or two in The Associated Press poll that comes out on Sunday. UP NEXT Oklahoma State plays No. 8 Oklahoma in the Bedlam game next Saturday in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

Matthew Tkachuk scored the only goal in the shootout, and the Flames beat the Philadelphia Flyers 3-2 on Saturday to stop a six-game slide. ""It feels good, obviously,"" Flames coach Bill Peters said. ""We needed it.""","Lindholm tied it at 2 when he scored with 1:23 left in regulation. After David Rittich was pulled in favor of an extra attacker, Rasmus Andersson's slap shot from the point went wide of the net. But it ricocheted off the back boards to a wide-open Lindholm, who knocked in his 11th of the season. ""We got a little bit of a bounce, but we were due for a bounce,"" Peters said. ""It's crazy. Some of the stuff that hasn't gone in was challenging. We were due."" Andrew Mangiapane also scored for the Flames, who were shut out in their previous three road games as part of their skid. ""It just feels really nice to be back in the win column,"" Andersson said. ""It felt like a long time ago. We're all excited in here."" Kevin Hayes and Jakub Voracek scored for Philadelphia, which lost for the fifth time in six games. ""We played extremely well but just came out on the wrong side of a shootout,"" Flyers coach Alain Vigneault said. Rittich made 27 saves and stopped all three Flyers attempts in the tiebreaker. Tkachuk, Calgary's second shooter, scored on a backhander that went through Carter Hart's legs. Philadelphia grabbed a 2-1 lead with 3:46 left in regulation when Hayes capitalized on a stellar hustle play by rookie forward Joel Farabee. Rittich tried to play the puck behind the net, but Farabee forced him into a turnover. Hayes then converted a backhander for his sixth of the season and second in as many games. Mangiapane tied it at 1 1:01 into the third period, stopping the Flames' long scoreless road drought. After a turnover by Flyers rookie Morgan Frost in his third career game, Mangiapane's wrist shot went off defenseman Philippe Myers and past Hart. Calgary's previous road goal had come Nov. 3 at Washington with two seconds left in the first period, a span of 261 minutes, 3 seconds between road scores. ""You have to stay positive,"" said Mangiapane, who played with a full face shield after breaking his nose in Thursday's 5-0 loss at St. Louis. ""As of late, goals haven't been bouncing our way. Eventually they would."" Flames star Johnny Gaudreau, a South Jersey native who attended nearby Gloucester Catholic High School, had the secondary assist on Lindholm's goal.

60,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",WORLD,,US security adviser says world silent on China camps,,,"Link to Image HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) - President Donald Trump's new national security adviser is criticizing what he says is silence from the rest of the world over China's confinement of more than 1 million Muslims in reeducation camps, linking the lack of a global outcry to China's economic clout. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien also questioned whether international leaders will stand up if Beijing carries out a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown on the pro -democracy protests in Hong Kong.","O'Brien met with journalists and was interviewed by a moderator at the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday. ""Where is the world? We have over a million people in concentration camps,"" O'Brien said. ""I've been to the genocide museum in Rwanda. You hear 'never again, never again is this going to happen,' and yet there are reeducation camps with over a million people in them."" O'Brien said the lack of criticism is especially surprising from Islamic states. China is estimated to have detained up to 1 million minority Muslims Uighurs in prisonlike detention centers. The detentions come on top of harsh travel restrictions and a massive state surveillance network equipped with facial recognition technology. China has denied committing abuses in the centers and has described them as schools aimed at providing employable skills and combating extremism. China and the U.S. are locked in a mutual trade war, and the Trump administration has alternated between blasting the country's leadership and reaching out to it. Trump imposed tariffs last year on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese exports to the U.S., seeking to ramp up pressure for changes in Chinese trade and investment policies. China has retaliated with tariff hikes of its own. O'Brien said an initial trade agreement with China is still possible by the end of the year, but said the U.S. won't take a bad deal and won't ignore what happens in Hong Kong. O'Brien also said U.S. allies should think hard before allowing Chinese technology giant Huawei into their next generation of telecommunication networks, citing surveillance concerns. ""What the Chinese are doing makes Facebook and Google look like child's play as far as collecting information on folks. Once they know the full profile of every man, woman and child in your country, how are they going to use that?"" he asked. Huawei spokespeople did not immediately return an email seeking comment Saturday. Dolkun Isa, President of the World Uyghur Congress, said at Saturday's conference that Trump himself has not addressed the camps publicly. Isa said his mother recently died in one of the camps. O'Brien responded that the administration has spoken out about it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is among the Trump officials who have raised China's mistreatment of the Muslim Uighur minority, including citing it as a violation of religious freedom in a speech last month. O'Brien declined to say what the U.S. would do if there were a crackdown in Hong Kong that rivals the Tiananmen Square in 1989. More than 100,000 Americans and over 300,000 Canadians live in Hong Kong. ""I don't want to get into tools or what the U.S. might or might not do,"" he said ""But much of the world and many or our allies, and many of the countries represented at this conference, have been willing to forget Tiananmen Square and are heavily engaged in business with China."" O'Brien is the fourth person in two years to hold the job of national security adviser. He previously served as Trump's chief hostage negotiator. O'Brien made headlines in July when he was dispatched to Sweden to monitor the assault trial of American rapper A$AP Rocky. As the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department, O'Brien worked closely with the families of American hostages and advised administration officials on hostage issues.",['ENGLISH'],641,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-CZDZIZA5VVFVVC5WXLNRGLMLKY,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N928000CC', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001996', 'className': 'NATIONAL SECURITY'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '83', 'classCode': 'STX001673', 'className': 'TARIFFS & DUTIES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DLOJ', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk', 'className': 'Trade Agreements'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DL5Q', 'className': 'TYPES OF GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001464', 'className': 'RELIGION'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000D9R3', 'className': 'ETHNIC CONFLICTS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000679', 'className': 'EXPORT TRADE'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'International Trade Law'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000D33D', 'className': 'POLITICAL PROTESTS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DL87', 'className': 'DEMOCRACIES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX000184', 'className': 'BIOMETRICS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DLDV', 'className': 'IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DKTF', 'className': 'SURVEILLANCE'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST0009S69', 'className': 'GENOCIDE'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'ST000DH0Q', 'className': 'AGREEMENTS'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'STX001688', 'className': 'TAXES & TAXATION'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001758', 'className': 'TREATIES & AGREEMENTS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001742', 'className': 'TRADE DISPUTES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000D5I9', 'className': 'PATTERN RECOGNITION'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA2Q0M0NzJERDUwNDE0OEE2QjYzQTc0NUFFRDJFMjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Museums'}], 'person': [{'score': '72', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}], 'city': [{'score': '55', 'classCode': 'GX071', 'className': 'BEIJING, CHINA'}], 'state': [{'score': '75', 'classCode': 'GR203', 'className': 'NORTH CENTRAL CHINA'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'GS173', 'className': 'NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA'}], 'country': [{'score': '98', 'classCode': 'GC302', 'className': 'CHINA'}, {'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC303', 'className': 'HONG KONG'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC554', 'className': 'RWANDA'}]}"

It is usually a quiet affair focused on community issues.","FULL TEXT But the race has taken on outsize significance in the midst of the increasingly violent protests that have divided the city. The election will be the first test of whether the protests can transform public anger that has led millions to take to the streets into actual votes, or whether the populace has grown weary of acts of civil disobedience that have snarled transportation and closed schools and businesses. ""Politically speaking, the battle of the district councils as a whole is a crucial battle in taking control,"" said Eddie Chu, a prodemocracy legislator who is also running for district council. It has been an especially intense election season. Several candidates, on both sides, have been attacked. The police fired tear gas at a campaign rally this month and arrested three candidates. Fears have been widespread that the city leadership could postpone the vote over the unrest. Here's a look at the race and what is at stake: Big election for small office A call to expand Hong Kong's limited democracy is one of the demands of the protest movement, which began in June over a now-withdrawn proposal that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Protesters have called for direct elections for the entire legislature, where currently only 40 of the 70 seats are selected by popular vote. They have also called for the chief executive, who is selected by a largely pro-Beijing election committee, to instead be chosen by voters. The district councils have no lawmaking power. They control small amounts of public funds for simple infrastructure, like rain shelters. They lodge concerns with government departments over noise, traffic, sanitation, and other issues. (Of the 479 district council seats, 452 are directly elected.) The district council members do have a modest role in choosing the chief executive, Hong Kong's highest official. Whichever side wins a majority of the seats controls 117 votes in the 1,200-member chief executive election committee. That election committee is dominated by pro-establishment corporate interests, and the chief executives they have selected have always been loyal to Beijing. But a win would give the overall prodemocracy camp control of an additional 10 percent of the votes and put it close to the 150 votes necessary to nominate a candidate. Protesters' demands encroach on local issues The brochures of district council candidates typically show neighborhood concerns they pledge to fix: trash-filled alleys, air-conditioners dripping on sidewalks, and streets lined with illegally parked cars. This year, several prodemocracy candidates have included protest slogans on their materials. Law Cheuk-yung, 22, said he was inspired to run for district council because of recent social movements. He said he would demand answers from the police after residents complained of possible testing of tear gas in his district. ""I want to imagine local government being more responsive,"" he said. ""At the moment the district council is just a rubber stamp. They do whatever the government wants."" For such candidates, it is more about playing to the sentiment of the protests rather than taking action. They would not have much of a role in addressing protesters' demands, which include an investigation into the police's use of force, offering amnesty to those arrested in the protests and expanding direct elections. Traditionally, an establishment stronghold Establishment parties have long had an advantage in these races, in part because they are much better funded, with backing from businesses. Currently the pro-Beijing camp holds 327 district council seats versus 124 for the prodemocracy group. Rising interest in the election has meant that prodemocracy candidates are participating in every race, unlike previous years, when some establishment district council members ran unopposed. And after worries about disqualifications, only one of the camp's candidates, the prominent activist Joshua Wong, was barred from running this year for political reasons. A campaign plagued by violence A string of violent attacks on election candidates has hung over the race. Twelve opposition figures, including prominent politicians and activists as well as first-time candidates, have been ambushed and bloodied by gangs of masked men or attacked while canvassing for votes. ""We can see Hong Kong isn't as free and as civilized as we'd previously imagined,"" said Jannelle Leung, a 25-year-old accountant who was struck in the back of her head with a hard object in early October the day she announced she was officially running.",['ENGLISH'],879,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-YU332DAOGAI6VNI5JO7YRLZ35U,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Local Governments'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001421', 'className': 'PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001970', 'className': 'TRENDS & EVENTS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX001498', 'className': 'RIOTS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000466', 'className': 'DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST00097CZ', 'className': 'ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST00097CR', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT PROCEDURE & LAWMAKING'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000D33D', 'className': 'POLITICAL PROTESTS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DL5Q', 'className': 'TYPES OF GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DL87', 'className': 'DEMOCRACIES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000300', 'className': 'CITY LIFE'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Governments'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000CUW5', 'className': 'CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000297', 'className': 'CITIES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjVGODM2RTczNkIwNEZEOUJBMDZDMTE0MDRGODRDNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM', 'className': 'Noise'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001932', 'className': 'CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ0QkQ5NzQ4QjQwNDgyREJEODJERDU3OENFNEE4QzQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkFBOUEzNjBDMERGNDRBQzkyQzk5NDlCODc1NDRBQjI', 'className': 'Extradition'}], 'city': [{'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GX071', 'className': 'BEIJING, CHINA'}], 'state': [{'score': '52', 'classCode': 'GR203', 'className': 'NORTH CENTRAL CHINA'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC303', 'className': 'HONG KONG'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC302', 'className': 'CHINA'}]}"

64,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",POLITICS,,New documents show contacts between Giuliani and Pompeo,,,Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - Newly released documents show Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was in contact with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the months before the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was abruptly recalled. The State Department released the documents Friday to the group American Oversight in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. They show that Pompeo talked with Giuliani on March 26 and March 29.,"FULL TEXT Austin Evers, executive director of American Oversight, said the documents reveal ""a clear paper trail from Rudy Giuliani to the Oval Office to Secretary Pompeo to facilitate Giuliani's smear campaign against a U.S. ambassador."" Last week, former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch told House impeachment investigators she felt ""kneecapped"" by a ""smear campaign"" Giuliani led against her. She was withdrawn from her post in Ukraine in May. The documents released Friday also include a report, that appears with Trump hotel stationery, that appears to summarize a Jan. 23 interview with a former Ukrainian prosecutor general, Victor Shokin. The summary says Giuliani and two business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were present. Parnas and Fruman were arrested last month on a four-count indictment that includes charges of conspiracy, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and falsification of records. The men had key roles in Giuliani's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter. A second memo appears to be a summary of an interview with Yuri Lutsenko, another former prosecutor general of Ukraine, conducted in the presence of Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman. Lutsenko is quoted raising questions about compensation that Hunter Biden received from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. In a Fox News interview, Giuliani was asked Saturday about the work that Parnas and Fruman did for him in Ukraine. The two men's efforts included helping to arrange a January meeting in New York between Giuliani and Lutsenko, as well as other meetings with top government officials. Lutsenko, who replaced Shokhin in 2016, left the post in August of 2019. ""So, they helped me find people, and as I've said, they did a good job, but they weren't investigators, and they weren't James Bond, and they didn't have personal communications with the president,"" Giuliani said. Giuliani allowed that he did introduce the two men to Trump at a Hanukkah party in December of 2018. But there was no extended meeting or conversations, he said. ""They took a one-minute picture. They walked away,"" he said. Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating the business dealings of Giuliani, including whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, according to people familiar with the probe. Giuliani was asked whether he was concerned about being indicted. ""Do you think I'm afraid. Do you think I get afraid? I did the right thing. I represented my client in a very, very effective way. I was so effective that I discovered a pattern of corruption that the Washington press has been covering up for three or four years,"" Giuliani asserted. Giuliani said he continues to have a good relationship with the president and that it can be assumed he talks to Trump ""early and often."" Giuliani said he's seen things written that Trump is intending to throw him under the bus. ""When they say that, I say he isn't, but I have insurance,"" Giuliani said.",['ENGLISH'],607,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-4ZHRSSQOFMI6VAYBDQ2CCYGPI4,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '23', 'month': '11', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009TRZ', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Governments'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0009TA3', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'N922130TM', 'className': 'PUBLIC PROSECUTORS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCX', 'className': 'US DEMOCRATIC PARTY'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DLOJ', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001342', 'className': 'POLITICAL CANDIDATES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0009TDZ', 'className': 'US FEDERAL ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST00097CZ', 'className': 'ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Federal Government'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N928120JM', 'className': 'EMBASSIES & CONSULATES'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000DANR', 'className': 'FALSE STATEMENTS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODVCRjhDNURBRDYzNDAzNjlFMDA3ODgyMUQ0ODhDRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkzMEJFRkNCRUQwNEIyOEE3QTBDOEFFM0ZDRDg0NzU', 'className': 'Arrests'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001648', 'className': 'SUITS & CLAIMS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTE1NDcxOEVFQ0ZGNDVGREIyN0YyMDNDQzdDRDJDMjk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZEQkQ2NTQxRjFBNEIzMUEzQkNFOTRBMDRCMUY5RDU', 'className': 'Freedom of Information'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUZBQzg5RTRGNTcwNDVFOEFDRjJFODQwOTc3NTFFOEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFFNkY3ODg0ODk4NEEwNTk4Q0RDNUQwMUI4NzgzMkM', 'className': 'Indictments'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'STX001371', 'className': 'HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0FGMDkyQTE0NTI1NEUyNkE0NjUxM0E2OTBDQjQ0NUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzZBMzM3QjFDOTcxNENCNzhBNTE0MzVGMzBBMzdERUY', 'className': 'Conspiracy'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'N921190MM', 'className': 'ELECTION AUTHORITIES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '50', 'classCode': 'N721110GM', 'className': 'HOTELS & MOTELS'}], 'person': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'PE000CTJ0', 'className': 'MIKE POMPEO'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'PE0009TK1', 'className': 'RUDY GIULIANI'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}, {'score': '53', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJK', 'className': 'JOE BIDEN'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS148', 'className': 'NEW YORK, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'GC581', 'className': 'UKRAINE'}, {'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
