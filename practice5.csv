0,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",OPINION,,A JFK mistress tells her story - and prompts a question,Shouldn't presidential libraries present a fuller truth about their subjects?,Scot Lehigh,"Link to Image She was a shy, star-struck college student. He was a famous, charismatic, perpetually on-the-make married politician who paid her special attention and then embarked on a secret affair with her. Flattered and smitten, she believed she truly mattered to him. Twice her age and sexually voracious, he was content to let her think so while he dallied with her. Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky? No, John F. Kennedy and Diana de Vegh, then a Radcliffe undergraduate and later a graduate student at Harvard, now an 83-year-old psychotherapist who told her story in Air Mail, Graydon Carter's digital newsweekly. In recounting her story some six decades later, de Vegh is reflecting on both the nature of her youthful delusion and the mores that enabled Kennedy's callous behavior.","FULL TEXT ""I think John Kennedy was absolutely a man of his culture, because he didn't just behave in a piggish way with women without the support of no end of other men,"" she said in an interview. With the help of aides and enablers, Kennedy arranged for her to attend his political events and then to come to his Boston apartment, where their sexual relationship commenced. It continued in Washington once he became president. After her story was published, de Vegh told me, four women came up to her at a church service and told her that they had similar stories of sexual exploitation by older, powerful men. Therein lies an opportunity for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. It could break with presidential library boosterism and present a more honest and forthright picture of the 35th president and the political culture then and now. Would de Vegh participate in such an exercise? If its purpose was to say, ""He was a man of his culture, and now let's look at the culture and how it betrayed women and how there were no limits for men,"" then she would. De Vegh acknowledges she doesn't have any pictures of herself with Kennedy, let alone proof of their affair. Still, her account, which she has previously confided to others, fairly closely mirrors that of Mimi Alford, a White House intern Kennedy singled out for special notice - and then determined sexual attentions - when she was 19. It is, of course, hardly headline news that JFK was a serial philanderer or that numerous other politicians are as well. My view is that if public figures have consensual affairs that aren't age exploitative or pursued in ways that use as leverage an imbalance in personal or professional power or involve unwanted comments or physical contact, it's really not a ­­­­­­matter of huge political moment. But Kennedy's affairs with de Vegh and Alford fell well outside those boundaries. Alford was still technically a teenager, de Vegh only 20. Kennedy was in his 40s. In many ways, Kennedy's age-inappropriate dalliances with de Vegh and Alford are similar to Bill Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. There is one big difference, however. Over the quarter-century since Clinton's sexual relationship with Lewinsky, he has been re-contextualized in no small part because of his louche sexual behavior. It is an aspect of his presidency that has led people to realize that for all his talents, Clinton was a lecherous politician who abused his power in relationships with women. But a similar reconsideration hasn't happened with JFK. Part of it is that his assassination froze him in memory in another era. Part of it is that because of his death at 46, Kennedy never had to face questions about his own behavior. And part of it is us: When confronted with troubling information about people we admire, we tend to resolve the cognitive dissonance not by developing a more complex view of that person but rather by wishing away that uncongenial information. Which raises this question: Why don't the presidential libraries of the two men offer a more forthright presentation about that aspect of their conduct? I put that query to both organizations - and received what at first struck me as a semi-thoughtful reply, via statement, from Alan Price, director of the JFK Library: ""The exhibits of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum focus on President Kennedy's public life and his service in office, rather than his private life. As with all of the presidential museums, the primary purpose of our exhibits is to promote an understanding of the presidency and the American experience. However, the Library and Archives branch of our institution is open to historians and researchers for projects that more fully explore the actions and events surrounding the Kennedy presidency, administration, and life."" Until, that is, I got this reply from the Clinton Library. ""The exhibits of the William J. Clinton and the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum focus on President Clinton's and President Kennedy's public life and their service in office, rather than their private lives. As with all of the presidential museums, the primary purpose is to promote an understanding of the presidency and the American experience. However, the Library and Archives branch of all of our institutions are open to historians and researchers for projects that delve deeper into the broader spectrum and events of each President's life beyond the impact of his presidency."" That standard-issue statement, I was advised, should be attributed to the National Archives and Records Administration, which is responsible for the administration of presidential libraries. Translation: Sorry, our partially taxpayer-supported presidential libraries really aren't interested in the whole truth. They prefer to provide a rose-colored journey along a carefully curated path. For her part, de Vegh said one of the most gratifying messages she has received since she told her story was from a friend who said she and her husband had a long conversation with their 23-year-old granddaughter about the way young women are exploited by older, more powerful men. The psychotherapist hopes her candid account will catalyze those kinds of conversations. ""Why are we not preparing young women better for this kind of unequal relationship?"" she asks. ""I think we really need to start taking apart the culture that so undermines young women.""",['ENGLISH'],1052,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-2QBLQCPQ2RDMNGGDXCZDAV4JAU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009QS2', 'className': 'REPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ', 'className': 'The Presidency'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDU1QkREN0FDNThENDhDMTk1MTk4MTQ3OUMzRjAwQjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Libraries'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DM4C', 'className': 'NATIONAL ARCHIVES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DODJ', 'className': 'PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000A0G9', 'className': 'SPECIAL LIBRARIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DFF5', 'className': 'SELFIES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0008XAK', 'className': 'SEXUAL BEHAVIOR'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX002120', 'className': 'PSYCHOLOGY'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX002121', 'className': 'PSYCHOTHERAPY'}, {'score': '59', 'classCode': 'STX000556', 'className': 'EDITORIALS & OPINIONS'}, {'score': '51', 'classCode': 'STX001970', 'className': 'TRENDS & EVENTS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000D17D', 'className': 'NEWS BRIEFS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDU1QkREN0FDNThENDhDMTk1MTk4MTQ3OUMzRjAwQjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Libraries'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DM4C', 'className': 'NATIONAL ARCHIVES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000A0G9', 'className': 'SPECIAL LIBRARIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DFF5', 'className': 'SELFIES'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX002120', 'className': 'PSYCHOLOGY'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX002121', 'className': 'PSYCHOTHERAPY'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA2Q0M0NzJERDUwNDE0OEE2QjYzQTc0NUFFRDJFMjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Museums'}], 'person': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'PE0009W2S', 'className': 'JOHN F KENNEDY'}, {'score': '58', 'classCode': 'PE0009VXO', 'className': 'BILL CLINTON'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
1,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",K-12,,Arizona banned school mask mandates. Now some kids are sick and parents are angry,,,"Link to Image Only weeks after Arizona's students went back to school, coronavirus infections are forcing thousands of children and teachers into quarantine. School outbreaks around Phoenix are surging. In one suburban district, so many drivers are sick that school buses are running 90 minutes late. All this in a state that ignored recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and banned school mask mandates weeks before classes resumed. Now the back-to-school turmoil has cascaded far beyond Arizona's classrooms, igniting a political uproar for Gov. Doug Ducey and other Republican leaders in this fast-changing desert battleground. The tumult underscores the perilous decisions facing governors in swing states where voters are divided over COVID-19 safety measures and personal freedoms. Ducey, a business-minded Republican, spent much of the past year getting attacked by conservatives angry about pandemic restrictions and his defense of the 2020 election results. But he has since doubled down on anti-mask-mandate measures passed by Arizona's Republican-run Legislature.","FULL TEXT He pledged to withhold millions of dollars in federal pandemic relief from schools that pass mask mandates in defiance of a state law that takes effect at the end of September. He offered $7,000 vouchers to families that opt to leave districts that require face coverings. Masking decisions, he said, belonged to parents, not school officials. ""In Arizona we are pro-parent,"" Ducey said at a recent news conference. ""I want parents to do what they think is the right thing to do."" On the ground, schools say they are facing a no-win choice. In the Phoenix suburb of Chandler, the school board called an emergency meeting in August to decide whether students and staff should be required to wear masks. School officials said violating state law could prevent the district from receiving $11 million to hire staff and help students catch up after so much lost school time. The mask mandate failed, three votes to two. Disheartened Chandler parents who supported the requirements said the board had put money above their children's health. ""They're not protecting our kids,"" said Sandy Kirby, a Chandler parent and nurse. But Kelli Wilson, a devoted Trump voter in Chandler whose 13-year-old son is unvaccinated and does not wear a mask to school, was gratified. Wilson, who had soured on Ducey when the gym she runs was forced to close down early in the pandemic, credited the governor with letting parents decide about masks. ""Finally Doug Ducey's doing something right,"" she said. Ducey had kept a lower profile throughout much of the pandemic compared with the Republican governors of Florida, South Dakota and Texas, who built national reputations as combative opponents of COVID restrictions. But as he looks to his political future after he leaves office next year because of term limits, Ducey is moving to the front of the volatile new battle over personal freedoms, children's health and the politicization of pandemic relief money. Education groups have sued to overturn the mask-mandate ban, and more than a dozen school districts across Arizona have passed mask mandates despite the ban. The Biden administration warned governors like Ducey and Ron DeSantis of Florida not to block federal money from pro-masking schools. The conflict is unfolding in a onetime Republican stronghold now torn in opposite directions, pulled to the left by growing numbers of young, college-educated voters and moderates in the booming Phoenix suburbs, and to the right by vocal Trump loyalists. With virus hospitalizations climbing to about 2,000 people from about 520 in early July, many parents, teachers' unions and public health officials said Ducey's actions punished schools that were following scientific advice. The CDC recommends masks for all students, staff and visitors inside schools. ""It puts people's lives at risk,"" said Jann-Michael Greenburg, president of the Scottsdale Unified School District, which has faced threats since passing a temporary mask mandate. ""I wonder if we would have won the battle against polio if this is how our governments behaved."" Ducey, a vocal supporter of vaccinations, has been battered from several sides throughout the pandemic. Democrats criticized him for not imposing a statewide mask mandate and loosening restrictions prematurely. Many of the loudest attacks, however, have come from the right wing of Arizona's splintered Republican Party. In January, the state party censured him for taking emergency actions such as closing gyms and bars at the outset of the pandemic. Ducey has also endured months of attacks from his Republican base in the wake of the 2020 election. Ducey had campaigned for President Donald Trump but declined to embrace Trump's false claims about a rigged election. He certified President Joe Biden's 10,500-vote victory in Arizona but has kept largely quiet as a polarizing audit of the votes ordered by state Republican leaders drags on. Some political observers saw Ducey's moves against mask mandates as an effort to patch a rift with conservatives. ""He's trying to court that constituency to move back,"" said Chuck Coughlin, a Republican political strategist in Phoenix. ""He's never going to recover with them. He can't. Once Trump starts tweeting about you in a derogatory sense, the gloves are off."" Ducey is chairman of the Republican Governors Association and often mentioned as a potential candidate for president, vice president or U.S. Senate. He has said he is focused on his job and is not challenging Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat up for reelection in 2022. Last month, just after he wrapped up a solemn bill-signing ceremony in front of Holocaust survivors, Ducey held a rare news conference and faced a barrage of questions about the anti-mask measures. He quickly pivoted to criticize Biden's handling of the coronavirus and a range of other issues as ""weak and pathetic"" and told the administration to butt out of Arizona's mask debates. ""Why don't they focus on their day job?"" Ducey asked, his voice rising, as masked reporters crowded around him. ""Take care of the nation's borders, and help Americans leave Afghanistan, and leave the schools to the states."" The clamor over masking has been fierce in Arizona, where thousands of redshirted teachers poured into the streets in Phoenix three years ago to demand better salaries and school funding. Last year, Arizona let local governments write their own mask rules. But this summer, the state Legislature added a provision outlawing school mask mandates to a tax-cutting budget bill central to Ducey's agenda. The governor signed the measure into law in late June. Arizona's huge and politically powerful public colleges and universities, which are not bound by the same rules that restrict local schools, have passed their own mask mandates in a potential challenge to the state. Arizona State University announced mask requirements in classrooms and labs, and the University of Arizona is requiring masks indoors where people cannot socially distance. Kathy Hoffman, superintendent of Arizona's public schools, said the barrage of executive orders and legal fights had been ""demoralizing"" to school employees. While Arizona has not seen nearly as severe a spike as Florida or Texas, health officials in Phoenix recently warned that children under 12 - who are not eligible to be vaccinated - make up one-sixth of Maricopa County's COVID-19 cases, and that hospitalizations of children have doubled monthly. ""People are feeing pretty devastated right now,"" said Hoffman, an elected Democrat. Some Republicans want even harsher penalties for defiant schools. ""They should lose as much funding as the state Legislature allocates to them,"" said state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, a Republican who is running to replace Arizona's Democratic secretary of state. ""What they are doing, the chaos they're causing, is not only reckless but dangerous."" It is a charge that pro-mask school board members throw back at Arizona leaders. Lindsay Love, a Chandler school board member, said she had received death threats and been called racist slurs throughout the pandemic. She worried that the state's threats of withholding money from districts that impose mandates could have dangerous new consequences. The state says ""the health of our students doesn't matter as much as those dollars,"" Love said. ""How much is a student worth to us if they die of COVID?""",['ENGLISH'],1461,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-3R2DNE2SGZB3FEPHTLG5Y4VMEI,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Education Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'ST0009TD5', 'className': 'US REPUBLICAN PARTY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000290', 'className': 'CHILDREN'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DPX0', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX002064', 'className': 'EPIDEMICS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DRL9', 'className': 'FACE MASK MANDATES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000912', 'className': 'INFECTIOUS DISEASE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DOXW', 'className': 'PANDEMICS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009OZR', 'className': 'PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001880', 'className': 'PUBLIC HEALTH'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001691', 'className': 'TEACHING & TEACHERS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DQGE', 'className': 'COVID CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REI2NEE4Nzk1Nzc3NEIzQkFFMzE2ODAyNUQzQkQ2Q0I7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Faculty & Staff'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9C', 'className': 'GOVERNORS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009P2D', 'className': 'SUBURBAN SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX002044', 'className': ""CHILDREN'S HEALTH""}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DOTY', 'className': 'CORONAVIRUSES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DOTH', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODhDOTBDNkNGQUQwNDUxRTk0M0ZDQ0RBRUNFNjM3ODg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Administration & Operation'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000691', 'className': 'FAMILY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX002082', 'className': 'ISOLATION & QUARANTINE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000COUY', 'className': 'PREVENTION & WELLNESS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N923120CC', 'className': 'PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REZEMjUxMkJBNUI0NDExM0FFRkI5RkYwRUUyM0ZGMzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODhDOTBDNkNGQUQwNDUxRTk0M0ZDQ0RBRUNFNjM3ODg', 'className': 'Student Transportation'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX002145', 'className': 'VIRUSES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DOFE', 'className': 'SAFETY REGULATION & POLICY'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001645', 'className': 'SUBURBS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000CYBP', 'className': 'CONSERVATISM'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzJCRkJGNjA2MTc4NDBGOThEMjE0M0Q4QzRDM0VCMUQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODhDOTBDNkNGQUQwNDUxRTk0M0ZDQ0RBRUNFNjM3ODg', 'className': 'Elementary & Secondary School Boards'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000511', 'className': 'DISEASES & DISORDERS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001963', 'className': 'SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST00097YK', 'className': 'RECRUITMENT & HIRING'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009P2D', 'className': 'SUBURBAN SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001175', 'className': 'MOTORCOACHES & BUSES'}], 'person': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'PE000DHHO', 'className': 'DOUG DUCEY'}], 'city': [{'score': '88', 'classCode': 'GX540', 'className': 'PHOENIX, AZ, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GS118', 'className': 'ARIZONA, USA'}]}"
2,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,McCarthy warns companies not to comply with Jan. 6 panel's request,,,"Link to Image WASHINGTON - House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, is threatening telecommunications and social media companies that comply with a request by the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, declaring that Republicans ""will not forget"" their actions. McCarthy spoke with former president Donald Trump on the day of the attack and is a potential witness in the select committee's probe. His statement comes after the panel on Monday asked 35 companies to retain phone records and other information related to the attack as it ramps up its investigation ahead of the return of Congress next month.","FULL TEXT ""Adam Schiff, Bennie Thompson, and Nancy Pelosi's attempts to strong-arm private companies to turn over individuals' private data would put every American with a phone or computer in the crosshairs of a surveillance state run by Democrat politicians,"" McCarthy said in a statement Tuesday night, referring to the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, the chairman of the select committee, and the House speaker. ""If these companies comply with the Democrat order to turn over private information, they are in violation of federal law and subject to losing their ability to operate in the United States,"" McCarthy said. ""If companies still choose to violate federal law, a Republican majority will not forget and will stand with Americans to hold them fully accountable under the law."" Tim Mulvey, a spokesman for the select committee, said Wednesday that the panel ""won't be deterred by those who want to whitewash or cover up the events of January 6th, or obstruct our investigation."" ''The Select Committee is investigating the violent attack on the Capitol and attempt to overturn the results of last year's election,'' Mulvey said in a statement. ''We've asked companies not to destroy records that may help answer questions for the American people.'' Pelosi in June announced the formation of a select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, after Senate Republicans blocked an effort to form an independent, bipartisan commission. McCarthy opposed both the bipartisan commission and the select committee. The panel is charged with investigating the facts and causes of the insurrection and will provide recommendations to help prevent similar attacks in the future. The select committee's chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, recently said his panel would not shy away from investigating lawmakers as part of its inquiry, highlighting the remarkable nature of Congress investigating an attack on itself. The committee's plans have already drawn criticism from Republicans, most of whom have opposed investigating the insurrection and Trump's role in inspiring the mob with his false claims about Joe Biden's win in the 2020 election. The request that went out Monday was sent to tech and social media companies including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Signal, as well as telecommunications companies such as Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile. The panel is asking the 35 companies to preserve ''metadata, subscriber information, technical usage information, and content of communications for the listed individuals.'' Washington Post Okla. lawmaker reportedly threatened ambassador, staff The call to the US ambassador to Tajikistan came in Monday. On the line, two US officials said, was Representative Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma, with an unusual and urgent request: He needed assistance in transporting a huge amount of cash into the country, saying he was going to neighboring Afghanistan to rescue five American citizens, a woman and her four children, stuck in the country. They planned to hire a helicopter for the effort. Mullin told the embassy that he planned to fly from Tblisi, Georgia, into Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, in the next few hours and needed the top diplomat's help, according to the two US officials familiar with the incident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private conversations about a sensitive matter. The answer was no. Embassy officials told Mullin they could not assist him in skirting Tajikistan's laws on cash limits on his way to visiting one of the most dangerous places on Earth. Mullin was outraged by the response, the officials said - threatening US Ambassador John Mark Pommersheim and embassy staff and demanding to know the name of staff members he was speaking with. The episode marked Mullin's second attempt to travel to Afghanistan in as many weeks for an unauthorized evacuation effort despite the perilous security environment. Last week, Mullin traveled to Greece and asked the Department of Defense for permission to visit Kabul. The Pentagon denied Mullin's request, an administration official said. Mullin's behavior has alarmed top US officials who say he has gone to extraordinary lengths to defy US warnings. The attempt follows an unauthorized trip to Afghanistan by Representatives Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Peter Meijer, Republican of Michigan, last week, which Pentagon and State Department officials criticized as a public relations stunt that sapped government resources during a national security crisis. As of late Tuesday, US officials said they were unsure of Mullin's location. ''To say this is extremely dangerous is a massive understatement,'' said a State Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive situation. Mullin's office did not respond to multiple requests for comment before this story published. After it published, Meredith Blanford, a spokeswoman for Mullin, put out a statement saying that Mullin ''has been and is currently completely safe"" and that he and his office ''will continue to do anything in our power to bring home all Americans from the war zone that President Biden abandoned.'' The statement said the office had no further comment. On Wednesday morning, Mullin posted a photo of himself on Instagram saying he was ''heading home"" without specifying where he was. Washington Post GOP Senator acknowledges Trump loss in Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, one of former president Donald Trump's staunchest congressional allies who has supported an audit of the election results in Wisconsin, acknowledged that the only reason Trump lost the state to President Biden was because he underperformed compared to other Republicans, according to a video released Tuesday. Speaking at a GOP event outside Milwaukee on Sunday, Johnson was asked by a liberal activist who posed as a conservative about the false and debunked belief that Biden won the election due to voter fraud. Instead of supporting the activist's false theory, Johnson pointed to a different explanation for Trump's defeat in Wisconsin: Republicans, as a whole, received more votes in races for other statewide offices than the former president. ''There's nothing obviously skewed about the results,'' Johnson said, according to a video posted by liberal activist Lauren Windsor. ''If all the Republicans voted for Trump the way they voted for the Assembly candidates, he would have won. He didn't get 51,000 votes that other Republicans got, and that's why he lost.'' Biden won Wisconsin by nearly 21,000 votes, flipping a state Trump won in 2016 by about the same margin. The president's win has been repeatedly reaffirmed through recounts and court rulings, and lawsuits from Trump allies and Republicans challenging Biden's victory were defeated time and time again.

The roster was heavy on seniors, headlined by four-year stalwarts Dominic Craig and Mike Sawicki, a two-time Globe All-Scholastic.","FULL TEXT Realizing that numbers might be an issue, Carver athletic director Phyllis Bowie opened team registration in June to prompt action. By last week, however, with the start of MIAA preseason workouts, there was concern. Only seven players, including no rising seniors, had registered. On Thursday, Bowie made the difficult decision to cancel the varsity season and reached out to the other ADs in the South Shore League to remove the Crusaders from their schedule. Carver will now try to field a junior varsity team to keep the program alive. ""We graduated 10-11 seniors; obviously that played a role,"" said Bowie, who called the development a little bit surprising. ""And that is why we started registration early. You figure a few kids would [sign up] last minute. But by last Thursday, we had to take a serious look at the program, and we had to consider the rest of the league too."" Registration remains open and Bowie is hopeful that with the first day for school scheduled for Tuesday, ""We can get the word out, and see what we can do as far as recruiting. At this point, we are trying to rebuild the program."" The girls' soccer program, according to Bowie, had 25 candidates try out, and the football roster numbers between 45-50. Sawicki and Craig each capped their stellar four-year careers with 100-plus points, second and third, respectively, on the program's career point list.",['ENGLISH'],299,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-4FRPZFJL2JERZC7AUP7V7M2MXY,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'STX000848', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzBBQzFGOUQ2NzlGNDMzMUEwQ0IxNTdDOTNFQ0Y2QjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Intercollegiate & Interscholastic Athletics'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001587', 'className': 'SOCCER'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000A3NR', 'className': 'SOCCER TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST0009JZH', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DRKM', 'className': ""WOMEN'S SPORTS""}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001066', 'className': 'MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'STX000848', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'N610000CC', 'className': 'EDUCATIONAL SERVICES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST0009JZH', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOLS'}]}"
4,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,Biden meets Ukraine leader in long-sought Oval Office visit,,,"Link to Image WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden used his first meeting with a foreign leader since ending the war in Afghanistan to send the message Wednesday that the United States - unburdened of its ""forever war"" - is determined to become a more reliable ally to its friends, in this case Ukraine. Biden played host to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a long-sought Oval Office meeting and tried to reassure him that his administration remains squarely behind the Eastern European nation.","FULL TEXT Biden didn't mention Afghanistan in his brief appearance with Zelensky before cameras. But he highlighted his concerns about Russian aggression in the region. Biden, in making his case to end the war in Afghanistan, repeatedly said winding down the 20-year conflict would allow the US to put greater focus on combating malevolent acts from adversaries Russia and China. ""The United States remains firmly committed to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression and for Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" Biden said. The Ukrainian leader, who had found himself ensnarled in Donald Trump's first impeachment, arrived at the White House looking to Biden for increased military aid and backing for his country's bid for NATO membership. The meeting was postponed two days while Biden and his national security team were consumed by the American military withdrawal from Afghanistan. The withdrawal, which concluded Monday, left behind many Afghans who had worked with the Americans and their allies and who now fear Taliban rule. This led to criticism that the US was less than a reliable international partner, something Biden was eager to counter. The optics of the moment did not go unnoticed by the Ukrainian president, who is looking to strengthen his country's relationship with the US. ""At a difficult time for the world and the United States ... still you found time for us and we're thankful for this indeed,"" Zelensky said. In advance of the sit-down, the Biden administration said it was committing up to $60 million in new military aid to Ukraine. The administration said in a notification to Congress that the aid package for Ukraine was necessary because of a ""major increase in Russian military activity along its border"" and because of mortar attacks, cease-fire violations, and other provocations. Zelensky thanked Biden for the aid. ""The war in Donbas is in its eighth year, and we have lost 15,000 people,"" Zelensky said in a reference to the conflict with Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. In their private talks, Zelensky was expected to bring up Washington's decision not to block the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would carry Russian natural gas directly to Germany, bypassing Ukraine. The pipeline is vehemently opposed by Ukraine and Poland as well as both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, with Zelensky describing it as a powerful geopolitical weapon for Russia. Zelensky, a television actor new to politics, took office in May 2019 anxious to firm up his country's relationship with the United States. Instead, he almost immediately found himself under pressure from Trump envoys and soon Trump himself, who in the phone call that led to his first impeachment asked Zelensky to ""do us a favor."" In that now famous July 2019 call, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Trump's European Union envoy, Gordon Sondland, later told impeachment investigators that Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani explicitly sought a ""quid pro quo"" in which an Oval Office visit would be contingent on Zelensky announcing the politically charged investigation Trump wanted. ""Was there a 'quid pro quo?'"" Sondland asked. ""With regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes."" Besides the coveted invitation to the White House, Sondland also said it was his understanding that Trump was holding up nearly $400 million in military aid until Ukraine announced the investigation. Allegations that Trump withheld congressionally approved military aid while seeking Ukraine's help for his reelection campaign formed the basis of the the first impeachment case against him. Trump was acquitted by the Senate. The Oval Office meeting with Zelensky never happened. With Biden, Zelensky now has a president with a long history of involvement in Ukraine, one who has supported its determination to break free from Russia, shore up its young democracy, and be more fully welcomed into the Western club. As vice president, Biden was the Obama administration's point person on Ukraine and pushed for tougher action against corruption. He once boasted of his success in getting Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who had blocked some corruption investigations. Trump later twisted this by insisting, wrongly, that Biden had done so to protect his son and the energy company on whose board he served. Zelensky is the latest Ukrainian president to promise to tackle systemic corruption and then struggle once in office. On Wednesday, Biden wanted assurances that Zelensky remains committed to following through on various reforms, a senior US administration official said. Zelensky was looking for greater economic and military assistance. And he has said he wanted a clear statement from Biden on whether he supports eventual NATO membership for Ukraine. NATO members are wary given Ukraine's simmering conflict with Russia. The $60 million security package will include more Javelin anti-tank missiles, which Kyiv sees as critical to defending against the Russia-backed separatists who have rolled through eastern Ukraine. The US has overall committed more than $400 million in military aid this year.",['ENGLISH'],1012,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-5PVTF3LCEJE7PEYYTED3M4255Q,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001814', 'className': 'WAR & CONFLICT'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'ST000DLNH', 'className': 'FOREIGN AID'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'N928120KM', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'N928000CC', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DET3', 'className': '2014 UKRAINIAN PROTESTS & UPRISING'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001551', 'className': 'SEPARATISM & SECESSION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000CURU', 'className': 'TALIBAN'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000466', 'className': 'DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001996', 'className': 'NATIONAL SECURITY'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DM6W', 'className': 'CEASEFIRES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DOOG', 'className': 'CAMERAS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTYxNzdCMkVBQkIyNEM2RTk2MDkzQjNEMTg4MzVFRTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA', 'className': 'Natural Gas Industry'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001198', 'className': 'NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS'}], 'person': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJK', 'className': 'JOE BIDEN'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DO7M', 'className': 'VOLODYMR ZELENSKY'}, {'score': '58', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}], 'country': [{'score': '99', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '95', 'classCode': 'GC578', 'className': 'RUSSIAN FEDERATION'}, {'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC508', 'className': 'AFGHANISTAN'}, {'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC581', 'className': 'UKRAINE'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC302', 'className': 'CHINA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GT115', 'className': 'EUROPE'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC318', 'className': 'GERMANY'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GC361', 'className': 'POLAND'}, {'score': '58', 'classCode': 'GR146', 'className': 'EASTERN EUROPE'}]}"
5,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,"Kaycee Moore, who starred in landmark Black independent films, dies at 77",,,"Link to Image Kaycee Moore, an actress who helped fuel the creation of a new Black cinema, bringing intensity and vulnerability to her performances in three landmark independent films - ""Killer of Sheep,"" ""Bless Their Little Hearts,"" and ""Daughters of the Dust"" - died Aug. 13 at 77. Her family announced her death in an obituary published by a funeral home in Kansas City, Mo., but did not say where or how she died. Although Ms. Moore appeared in only five films, she was among the most celebrated actors of the L.A. Rebellion, an alternative to Hollywood filmmaking that emerged out of the University of California at Los Angeles, where Black directors such as Charles Burnett, Julie Dash, and Billy Woodberry trained in the 1970s and '80s.","FULL TEXT ""Every scene she was in, she brought it to life,"" said Burnett, who worked with Ms. Moore in ""Killer of Sheep"" (completed in 1977) and ""Bless Their Little Hearts"" (1983). In a phone interview, he lamented that Ms. Moore ""didn't get the opportunity to display her talent"" in more films, adding, ""It's a sad observation about America and how we treat people of color. She definitely could have had her own TV show, could have been that successful."" Ms. Moore fell into acting after moving from Kansas City to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, where she worked for the cosmetics line Max Factor and then joined a theater workshop. ""She was having a really difficult time while living in Los Angeles, some mental health difficulties,"" said Samantha Sheppard, a Cornell University film scholar who interviewed her in 2018. ""She felt that acting had saved her life."" While performing in student plays and movies, she met Burnett, a UCLA graduate student who cast her in his thesis project, ""Killer of Sheep,"" a low-budget meditation on Black life in the Watts section of Los Angeles, where he had grown up. Shot in black-and-white for $10,000, the film starred Henry G. Sanders as Stan, a slaughterhouse worker and father of two, and Ms. Moore as the unnamed matriarch struggling to keep their family together. The film was never intended for wide release. But with its poetic shots of children leaping between rooftops, and of Ms. Moore and Sanders dancing languorously to Dinah Washington's ""This Bitter Earth,"" it acquired a reputation as an independent classic. It was one of the first 50 movies inducted into the Library of Congress's National Film Registry, and was hailed by New York Times movie critic Manohla Dargis as ""an American masterpiece, independent to the bone,"" after it was restored and opened in theaters in 2007. Six years after it was first completed, Ms. Moore had a more substantial role as the overworked wife and mother Andais Banks in ""Bless Their Little Hearts,"" which was directed by Woodberry and written and shot by Burnett. Like ""Killer of Sheep,"" the film was centered on a working-class family in Watts, with Nate Hardman cast as Ms. Moore's unemployed husband, Charlie, who starts an affair. After Andais learns that he is funneling money to the other woman, she unleashes her anger in a 10-minute fight sequence - ""one of the great domestic cataclysms of modern movies,"" wrote New Yorker film critic Richard Brody - in which both spouses vent their anger in the kitchen. Filmed in a single uninterrupted take, the scene was ad-libbed and drawn in part from real life. As Ms. Moore told it, she had asked the filmmakers to leave a kitchen table in the scene as a way to create distance between her and Hardman, who had previously frightened her while lifting her out of her shoes during a stage play they appeared in together. But when she arrived to shoot the scene, the table was gone. ""I was panicked, afraid, and downright scared to death, and it was no act,"" the distribution company Milestone Film and Video quoted her as saying in a 2017 interview. ""It was taking me back to my late teens when a man who was supposed to love me would beat me for nothing. . . . I got it through my mind that this was a setup, and they did this so that Nate would hurt me and they could get it on film. Nate did hurt me, and they let him. ""But my best acting was after the scene had been shot,"" she continued. When it was over, she said, ""I did not let those three men (Charles, Billy, and Nate) know how I really felt. . . . I never brought the matter up again."" ""Bless Their Little Hearts"" was inducted into the National Film Registry, along with Ms. Moore's follow-up, ""Daughters of the Dust"" (1991), in which she appeared as a strong-willed woman who has married into a Gullah family in the early 20th century. Directed by Dash, the movie is generally considered the first feature made by a Black woman to get a wide release, and it was credited with inspiring some of the sumptuous imagery in Beyoncé's 2016 film ""Lemonade."" ""We all left the set knowing that we were putting together something pretty special,"" Ms. Moore told the Kansas City Star in 1992. ""Most Black films are stereotypical. You're a criminal, a prostitute or a seller of drugs. The films are about sex and violence. Blacks are victims; if it's a historic story, they're cotton pickers. ""But this,"" she continued, ""is a love story about a family."" Kaycee Collier was born in Kansas City, Kan., on Feb. 24, 1944. Two of her brothers reportedly died of sickle cell anemia, an inherited blood disorder, and her mother later worked to promote research and health services for people with the condition, founding a Kansas City chapter of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America. In 1984, Ms. Moore returned to Kansas City to help her ailing mother run the organization. By the time her mother died in 1990, Ms. Moore had succeeded her as executive director, a position she held for the next eight years. ""The sickle cell thing is not a career choice,"" she told the Salina (Kan.) Journal in 1993. ""I came back to help my mother and she died, and people from the city and state said, 'What are you going to do?' "" In time, she embraced the job, organizing charity concerts to raise money for research into the disease. ""I have pawned my jewelry to help keep our doors open,"" she later told the Star. A state legislator, Mary Groves Bland, credited Ms. Moore and her mother with helping to institute sickle-cell testing of all infants born in Missouri. Ms. Moore was married twice, to John Moore Jr. and Stephen Jones, who predeceased her. Survivors include two children, John Moore III and Michelle Swinton; four siblings; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. In recent years, Ms. Moore had been working on a screenplay, a historical drama set in the Kansas City area. She made her last film appearance in ""Ninth Street"" (1999), based on a play by Kevin Willmott, in which she starred alongside Isaac Hayes and Martin Sheen as a ""bag lady"" traumatized by her son's death in the Vietnam War. She said she had initially turned down a request to appear in the movie, which was filmed in Kansas City. ""Then I happened by the set with my husband, saw all the hustle . . . and the bug just bit me again,"" she told the Star. ""I said, 'I've got to do this even if it never makes a nickel, even if nobody ever sees it.' ""There were times when I had to change costumes at 23rd and Vine, right out in the street,"" she added. ""No dressing room, no privacy. That's one of the things about loving acting - you lose a lot of your shame.""",['ENGLISH'],1272,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-6WFTNGRERNFURD6RAHZ3M47IZY,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000A5F8', 'className': 'ACTORS & ACTRESSES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000453', 'className': 'DEATH & DYING'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000454', 'className': 'DEATH NOTICES & OBITUARIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009UV1', 'className': 'FILM'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009UGQ', 'className': 'THEATER'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000268', 'className': 'CELEBRITIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000A5KE', 'className': 'FILM SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001177', 'className': 'MOVIE REVIEWS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009P2K', 'className': 'THEATER & DRAMA EDUCATION'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000691', 'className': 'FAMILY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N921190TM', 'className': 'NATIONAL LIBRARIES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001444', 'className': 'RACE & ETHNICITY'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDU1QkREN0FDNThENDhDMTk1MTk4MTQ3OUMzRjAwQjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Libraries'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001113', 'className': 'MENTAL ILLNESS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000A5F8', 'className': 'ACTORS & ACTRESSES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009UV1', 'className': 'FILM'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000268', 'className': 'CELEBRITIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000A5KE', 'className': 'FILM SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N512107MM', 'className': 'MOVIE INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001177', 'className': 'MOVIE REVIEWS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N921190TM', 'className': 'NATIONAL LIBRARIES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDU1QkREN0FDNThENDhDMTk1MTk4MTQ3OUMzRjAwQjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Libraries'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'ST0009S3C', 'className': 'COSMETICS'}], 'city': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GX543', 'className': 'LOS ANGELES, CA, USA'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'GX609', 'className': 'KANSAS CITY, MO, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}, {'score': '57', 'classCode': 'GS141', 'className': 'MISSOURI, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

Instead of playing in the Superdome for the Sept. 12 opener against the Green Bay Packers, the Saints will host the game at the home of the Jaguars, the NFL announced Wednesday. While the Superdome appears to have been spared significant damage from the powerful Category 4 hurricane, there are logistical challenges with staffing an NFL game there  because of the widespread damage in the New Orleans area.","FULL TEXT ""I am proud of the collective communications that occurred between many entities in a short amount of time that led to us making this decision,"" said Saints owner Gayle Benson. ""It is never easy to make a decision that involves not playing a Saints home game in the Caesars Superdome, but I am confident that this is the right decision for our city at this juncture."" General manager Mickey Loomis said the Saints expect to play a lot of home games at the Superdome this season. After the opener, the Saints have road games at Carolina and the Patriots before their next scheduled home game Oct. 3 against the New York Giants. Two more road games and their bye week follow before they host defending Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay on Oct. 31. The Saints evacuated New Orleans before the storm and went to North Texas; they have practiced this week at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. They are remaining in Texas for workouts next week, and will travel to Jacksonville the day before the season opener. ""We've got a firm plan for the next week of preparation. ... We've got a place to practice and a place to stay for our team,"" Loomis said. ""I don't think there's anything really too unique about playing on the road if we have to do this Week 1, because we're going to do that Week 2 and Week 3. So it'll be a normal road trip, it's just departing from here."" The arrival of Ida came 16 years to the day after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. The Saints were forced to move for the entire 2005 season, setting up operations in San Antonio while playing home games there and in Baton Rouge at LSU. New Orleans also played one ""home"" game at Giants Stadium while going 3-13 that season. Spurred on by the quick restoration of the Superdome, the Saints went 10-6 and won the NFC South in 2006, Sean Payton's first season at coach.

Butler did confirm it's one of the reasons why Tuitt did not practice with the team at all during training camp. ""His knee is bothering him, as far as I know,"" Butler said.

While Steelers coach Mike Tomlin has insisted that the 28-year-old Tuitt - who is coming off a career-best 11 sacks in 2020 - is ""fine,"" he is also helping his mother grieve the loss of his younger brother. Richard Bartlett III, 23, died after being struck in a hit-and-run accident in Georgia in June. ""To tell you the truth, I don't know how I'd handle my mom watching her son die,"" Butler said. ""I don't know if I could handle that. So, I'm not sure what to tell you, other than that his knee is bothering him a little bit and he might be a little bit overweight and what he's doing with his mother."" Butler added he believes the Steelers will get Tuitt back, but declined to offer a guess on when that might be. Under NFL rules, the earliest Tuitt will be able to practice with the rest of the team is in three weeks. The Steelers prepared for Tuitt's loss by keeping eight defensive linemen when rosters were trimmed to 53 on Tuesday, including rookie Isaiahh Loudermilk.",['ENGLISH'],758,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-77GVDLUR7BCIZLD7XJVG6KLRPE,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'STX000081', 'className': 'AMERICAN FOOTBALL'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008XAN', 'className': 'DISPLACED PERSONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009F7U', 'className': 'HURRICANES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000C9YJ', 'className': 'AMERICAN FOOTBALL TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009R5P', 'className': 'HURRICANE KATRINA'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001197', 'className': 'NATURAL DISASTERS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0009SE3', 'className': 'STADIUMS & ARENAS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001066', 'className': 'MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS'}], 'city': [{'score': '95', 'classCode': 'GX608', 'className': 'NEW ORLEANS, LA, USA'}, {'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GX604', 'className': 'JACKSONVILLE, FL, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX564', 'className': 'BATON ROUGE, LA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX621', 'className': 'TAMPA, FL, USA'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'GX601', 'className': 'NEW YORK, NY, USA'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'GX592', 'className': 'DALLAS, TX, USA'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'GX512', 'className': 'SAN ANTONIO, TX, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GS159', 'className': 'TEXAS, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS125', 'className': 'FLORIDA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS134', 'className': 'LOUISIANA, USA'}]}"
7,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",THEATER,,Rick Canavan's debut album marks a farewell to comedy,,Nick A. Zaino III,"Link to Image Rick Canavan had roughly 18 years of material to choose from for his debut album, ""Who Am I?"" He approached his setlist as a ""best of,"" combing through jokes he'd been honing in local clubs for years. This would normally be the time when a comedian would be out promoting his new work on every stage he could find. But once the album drops Friday, Canavan isn't sure he'll ever get onstage again. Canavan was already disenchanted with stand-up before the pandemic. But when comedy clubs shut down as COVID-19 started to spread, it gave him an excuse to stop. ""As soon as I heard that [the virus] was airborne, I was not even thinking of getting in front of people again,"" he says, speaking by Zoom.","FULL TEXT Once comedy was gone, Canavan found he didn't miss it. He's maintained his longtime job working the late shift for an answering service, and he's taken up cooking. If he were to get back onstage now, he's not sure what he'd have to say. Material about the ever-present pandemic makes him cringe. ""My viewpoint is pretty different on things now,"" he says. ""I can't imagine going to a place and doing the act that I've worked on for 20 years. But I also can't imagine going to a place and talking about what's going on right now either. I don't think I'm the guy."" A lot of material on the album is observational, about things Canavan would now call ""trivial."" On one track, he talks about his family's favorite restaurant, the 99. ""Until I'd been there, I didn't know you could burn a salad,"" he says. His wife once asked if he would take a bullet for her, he says in another bit. ""I know that you're supposed to say yes. I said, 'Why?'"" he says. ""You know a lot of dangerous criminals that only can afford one bullet?"" Link to Image There is nothing wrong with dealing in trivial subjects. That's the stock in trade of popular comics from Jerry Seinfeld to Kathleen Madigan. But after the turmoil of recent months, that brand of stand-up doesn't interest Canavan. ""I'm trying to become smarter,"" he says. ""[I've been] trying to be a more well-rounded person for the last year and a half."" Canavan's comedy career has a familiar origin story. He did some sketch comedy in high school and found his way to open mics a short time later. People laughed, and he was hooked. It felt like he was on the cusp of something, getting more and more involved in the Boston scene. ""I think I let go of that probably about 10 years ago,"" he says. Now Canavan is happy just making his friends laugh. ""I have found that I am maybe the most creative and most funny just messaging my friends on text,"" he says, ""and it really fills a creative hole for me."" Shawn Carter is one of those friends. He now runs a club in Bristol, Tenn., but was running Maggie's Lounge in Quincy in 2019 when he booked Canavan for a night to record the album. He confirms that Canavan hasn't lost his comic instincts. ""He's got to be the person that I talk to the most through text messages,"" he says. ""I might be telling him something that is bothering me and he will not stop joking. And then that becomes the thing that's bothering me."" It was Carter who convinced Canavan to record the album. (Canavan mentions on one track that he did it on a dare.) He's happy the album is finally coming out, but he also understands his friend's decision to walk away. ""Maybe there has to be something missing from your life to want to keep doing comedy,"" he says. ""And I feel like Rick's got things set up pretty good right now. And maybe he's just happy."" Canavan wonders if he was perhaps too dedicated to comedy before the pandemic. The subtitle of the album is ""A night of comedy when my mom like, JUST died."" He never addresses the subject on the album, but his mother had died two days before the recording. It would have been easy to postpone it, but he'd been conditioned to the idea that comics don't cancel shows and went through with the recording. ""I still did the recording, which is like a whole 'nother reason why I'm so glad to be out,"" he says. ""Because I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have felt like I had to do it. The day she died I went to do a show that night, because I had to get ready for this album recording."" Canavan isn't promising he'll never step foot onstage again. He just can't imagine what would make him want to perform again. And if he never does, he's glad he has this album as a souvenir. ""I feel good about the time that I put into this and this being the output of that time,"" he says. ""There are things about comedy that are frustrating, and that I'm glad I don't have to deal with anymore. But the fact that I wrote these things, and I have this to put out, I'm really proud.""",['ENGLISH'],797,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-7MC37VCVHZEQXNQBIP2DCSIJU4,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DQGE', 'className': 'COVID CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000912', 'className': 'INFECTIOUS DISEASE'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000DOTH', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX001482', 'className': 'RESTAURANTS'}], 'person': [{'score': '57', 'classCode': 'PE0009TQH', 'className': 'JERRY SEINFELD'}]}"
8,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",COVID-19 VACCINES,,When might COVID-19 vaccines be cleared for children younger than 12?,,Amanda Kaufman,"Link to Image As COVID-19 infections continue to rise across the population due to the highly transmissible Delta variant and children begin to return to school, many parents are asking the same question: When will my child be able to get vaccinated? Moderna and Pfizer launched clinical trials of the vaccines for children younger than 12 earlier this year. The data will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for officials to review before granting emergency use clearance in the younger age group.","FULL TEXT Here's what we know about when the vaccines might be approved for children younger than 12. Where do the vaccine trials stand? Pfizer and Moderna both launched clinical trials for their vaccines in children younger than 12 in March. Pfizer's vaccine, which last week received full approval from the FDA for people 16 and older, is the only vaccine that has been approved for children between the ages of 12 and 15. Vaccines developed by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have received emergency authorization for use in people 18 and older. In late July, the FDA asked Pfizer and Moderna to increase the number of children enrolled in the clinical trials in an effort to learn more about rare side effects as a result of the vaccine. When might the vaccines be approved for children ages 5 to 11? A number of federal health officials have suggested recently that vaccines could be authorized in children ages 5 to 11 before the end of the year. In an interview with NPR last week, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said both Pfizer and Moderna haven't submitted their clinical trial data to the Food and Drug Administration yet. Collins said he doesn't think approval for vaccines in kids ages 5 to 11 will be granted ""much before the end of 2021."" Collins described some of the specific questions officials will need to address, including what dose younger children would receive compared to adults. ""I know a lot of people are really anxious to see this move forward,"" Collins said. ""It's a difficult situation because kids under 12 are not just little miniature human beings. They have differences in their metabolism, their immune system, so for instance the question: What's the dose you ought to give? Do you give the same dose to a 6 year old as you would to somebody who's 30? Probably you need to look at that."" He also provided an estimate of when he thinks the FDA will see clinical trial data. ""Pfizer thinks maybe by the end of September they'll be ready to send in their trial data and then FDA will have to review it,"" Collins said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, was asked on The Today Show last week if a COVID-19 vaccine for children younger than 12 might be approved before the December holidays. ""I think there's a reasonable chance that that'll be the case,"" Fauci replied, adding that Pfizer and Moderna are now collecting data on the safety of the vaccines, the correct dose, and the ability of the vaccines to generate an immune response. . ""That data ultimately will be presented to the FDA to look at it for the balance between safety and risk benefit ratio for the children,"" Fauci said. ""I hope all of that process will take place expeditiously and that we will have it on the time table that you just mentioned, hopefully by the mid-late fall and early winter."" Pressure is mounting for officials to give the vaccines approval for younger children As children are returning to school and infections rise generally across the population due to the highly infectious Delta variant, pressure is mounting on the FDA to authorize a vaccine for the younger age group. In a Twitter thread on Monday night, Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University's School of Public Health, said the case fatality rate in the United States, or the measure of how many cases lead to deaths, has fallen by 50 percent in the past six weeks. However, that metric has been driven by increasing infections among children 5 to 11, Jha said. Jha said the rate of infections among 5 to 11 year old children is increasing, now outpacing older age groups. Children are much less likely to be hospitalized and die of COVID-19 than adults, which explains why even as infection rates increase, the country's case fatality rate is dropping. But the fact that children, particularly those ages 5 to 11, are getting infected with the virus at higher rates raises the urgency of vaccinating the group, Jha wrote. ""I know [the] FDA [is] being very careful about making sure vaccines are safe in kids 5-11,"" Jha wrote. ""Good. But there is a cost to waiting until every box is checked. Young kids [are] getting infected at very high rates [and] need the protection of vaccines."" In a letter earlier this month to FDA acting commissioner Janet Woodcock, Representatives Ro Khanna and Katie Porter of California requested a briefing on the status of emergency approval on vaccines for children ages 2 to 11. Dozens of members of Congress, including Representatives Jake Auchincloss, Ayanna Pressley, and Lori Trahan of Massachusetts, cosigned the letter. ""As transmission rates increase and schools reopen for in-person instruction, parents need to know when their kids will be able to get vaccinated,"" the letter stated. The American Academy of Pediatrics also wrote to Woodcock last month urging the agency to ""continue working aggressively towards authorizing safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for children under age 12 as soon as possible."" The letter noted that pediatricians and families have been waiting for a vaccine for children under 12, especially with the rise of the Delta variant, which ""has created a new and pressing risk to children and adolescents across this country, as it has also done for unvaccinated adults."" ""In our view, the rise of the Delta variant changes the risk-benefit analysis for authorizing vaccines in children,"" the letter stated.",['ENGLISH'],1027,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-7NIUCUYUDRDKRNLHFTEPZLUN54,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'STX000290', 'className': 'CHILDREN'}, {'score': '96', 'classCode': 'STX001785', 'className': 'VACCINES'}, {'score': '93', 'classCode': 'ST000DOTH', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX000311', 'className': 'CLINICAL TRIALS'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST000DQGE', 'className': 'COVID CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000108', 'className': 'APPROVALS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DQAS', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS VACCINE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008WZ7', 'className': 'DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000912', 'className': 'INFECTIOUS DISEASE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000971C', 'className': 'PARENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST000DP57', 'className': 'DISEASE IMMUNITY'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'STX002144', 'className': 'VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00096VM', 'className': 'DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000511', 'className': 'DISEASES & DISORDERS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001880', 'className': 'PUBLIC HEALTH'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N923120CC', 'className': 'PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'STX001785', 'className': 'VACCINES'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX000311', 'className': 'CLINICAL TRIALS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DQAS', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS VACCINE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008WZ7', 'className': 'DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001323', 'className': 'PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001322', 'className': 'PHARMACEUTICALS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'STX002144', 'className': 'VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'pe000DP3Z', 'className': 'ANTHONY FAUCI'}]}"
9,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,"Officers, paramedics charged in Elijah McClain's 2019 death",,,"Link to Image DENVER - Three suburban Denver police officers and two paramedics were indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the death of Elijah McClain, a Black man who was put in a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative two years ago, Colorado's attorney general said Wednesday. The 23-year-old's death gained widespread attention during last year's protests against racial injustice and police brutality following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.","FULL TEXT McClain's pleading words captured on police body camera video - ""I'm just different"" - were posted on signs at protests and spoken by celebrities who joined those calling for the prosecution of the officers who stopped McClain as he walked down the street in the city of Aurora after a 911 caller reported that he looked suspicious. Stories about McClain, a massage therapist described by family and friends as a gentle and kind introvert, filled social media, including how he volunteered to play his violin to comfort cats at an animal shelter. The Aurora Police Department has been plagued by allegations of misconduct against people of color, including a officer charged this summer with pistol-whipping a Black man. The department's new chief has vowed to work to rebuild public trust. Attorney General Phil Weiser said a grand jury indicted Officers Randy Roedema, Nathan Woodyard, and Jason Rosenblatt and fire department paramedic Jeremy Cooper and fire Lieutenant Peter Cichuniec on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Roedema and Rosenblatt also each were charged with second-degree assault with intent to cause bodily injury and one count of a crime of violence related to the assault charge. Cooper and Cichuniec also each face three counts of second-degree assault. The Associated Press has sought comment from lawyers for the defendants. The Aurora Police Association said there was no evidence the officers caused McClain's death. ""The hysterical overreaction to this case has severely damaged the police department,"" the union said in a statement. At a brief news conference, Weiser said the goal was to seek justice for McClain and his loved ones. ""He was a son, a nephew, a brother, a friend,"" Weiser said. ""He had his whole life ahead of him."" Mother Sheneen McClain ""is overwhelmed emotionally by this news and appreciates the hard work of Phil Weiser and the rest of his team. There is not a day that goes by that she does not think of her son Elijah,"" according to a statement from her lawyer, Qusair Mohamedbhai. It's very rare for officers to face criminal charges in on-duty deaths, and it's almost unheard of for paramedics to be charged, said Alex Piquero, a criminologist at the University of Miami. ""It's a pretty big deal,"" he said. The fact that a grand jury saw the evidence and decided what charges to file is an indication of a strong case, Piquero said. Facing pressure during nationwide protests last year, Democratic Governor Jared Polis ordered Weiser to open a new criminal investigation. In 2019, a district attorney said he could not charge the officers because an autopsy could not determine how McClain died. It's one of several investigations, including separate reviews of McClain's arrest commissioned by the city and a comprehensive review of the Police Department. The US Justice Department and the FBI also announced a civil rights investigation into McClain's death, while Weiser's office is conducting a similar probe into the agency, the first under a new Colorado police accountability law. Aurora's highly critical review did not find any evidence to justify officers stopping McClain as he walked home from the store on Aug. 24, 2019, after a 911 caller had reported a man wearing a ski mask and waving his hands who seemed ""sketchy."" His family said McClain wore the mask because he had anemia that caused him to get cold easily. Police body camera video shows an officer approaching McClain on the sidewalk and saying, ""I have a right to stop you because you're being suspicious."" The officer turns McClain around and says, ""Relax, or I'm going to have to change this situation."" As other officers help restrain McClain, he asks them to let go, saying, ""You guys started to arrest me, and I was stopping my music to listen."" The officers' body cameras come off as they move McClain to the grass, but an officer can be heard saying McClain grabbed one of their guns. McClain tries to explain and sometimes cries out or sobs. He says he can't breathe and was just on his way home. ""I'm just different. I'm just different, that's all. That's all I was doing. I'm so sorry. I have no gun. I don't do that stuff. I don't do any fighting. Why were you attacking me? I don't do guns. I don't even kill flies,"" he said. One officer eventually retrieves his camera, which shows McClain handcuffed, lying on his side and periodically vomiting as another officer leans on him. Paramedics arrived and injected the 140-pound McClain with 500 milligrams of ketamine - more than 1 1/2 times the dose for his weight. The fire department is allowed to use the drug to sedate combative or aggressive people, but there's a lack of police training, conflicting medical standards, and nonexistent protocols that have resulted in hospitalizations and even deaths when it's used during police encounters.

10,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,Social Security is projected to be insolvent a year earlier than previously forecast,,,"The financial outlook for Social Security is eroding more quickly than previously expected, as the coronavirus pandemic has drained government revenues and put additional strain on one of the nation's most important social safety net programs. The overall finances for Medicare, however, are expected to hold steady, though the health program is still forecast to face financial pressure in the coming years. Annual government reports released Tuesday on the solvency of the programs underscored the questions about their long-term viability at a time when a wave of baby boomers are retiring and the economy faces ongoing uncertainty as variants of the coronavirus surge. The US economy already faces soaring federal debt levels in the coming decades, but both Democrats and Republicans have been wary of making significant structural reforms to the popular programs.","FULL TEXT ""Having strong Social Security and Medicare programs is essential in order to ensure a secure retirement for all Americans, especially for our most vulnerable populations,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. ""The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to safeguarding these programs and ensuring they continue to deliver economic security and health care to older Americans."" Senior administration officials said that the long-term effects of the pandemic on the programs are unclear. The actuaries were forced to make assumptions about how long COVID would continue to cause unusual patterns of hospitalizations and deaths and whether it would contribute to long-term disabilities among survivors. The Social Security Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund will now be depleted in 2033, a year earlier than previously projected, according to the report. At that time, the trust fund will run out of reserves and the program will be insolvent, with new tax revenues failing to cover scheduled payments. The report estimated that 76 percent of scheduled benefits will be able to be paid out unless Congress changes the rules to allow full payouts. The Disability Insurance Trust Fund is now expected to be depleted by 2057, which is eight years earlier than previously thought, at which time 91 percent of benefits will be paid. Medicare's finances are effectively holding steady. While tax revenue for the Medicare program did decline as a result of the COVID-related recession, Medicare also ended up spending less money than usual last year, as people avoided elective care. Medicare's hospital trust fund is projected to be unable to pay all of its bills beginning in 2026. This estimate is similar to those from Medicare's trustees in recent years. Fixing that gap now could be achieved by increasing the Medicare payroll tax rate from 2.9 percent to 3.67 percent or by reducing Medicare spending by 16 percent each year, the report notes. But the report highlighted that the official estimate may be unrealistically optimistic. If certain policies set to expire in the next 10 years are extended, or if other expected policy changes occur, the projections would look substantially more worrying. Long-term, the actuaries said they did not think COVID-19 itself would have substantial influence on Medicare spending on hospital care. On the one hand, the death of many vulnerable, older Americans from the virus may reduce future spending they would otherwise have received. On the other, the actuaries expect that some people may have additional health care needs from the syndrome known as long COVID. The actuaries declined to make any estimates on the effect of Aduhelm, a very expensive Alzheimer's treatment that was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The report said that officials were waiting for Medicare to issue guidance on how the drug will be covered before making any calculations. The drug could represent tens of billions of dollars in spending each year. Democrats in Congress are considering a host of changes to the Medicare program, such as adding new benefits, including coverage for dental, hearing, and vision care. While these changes are expected to influence Medicare's overall finances, none of them are likely to have major effects on the trust fund, which covers only hospital care.",['ENGLISH'],746,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-ANG2TPDTPFH5ZKLYGCAZKWDAAU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Public Health & Welfare Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwRTY1MDg3MTk5NDUyNkFFRDI1RjJBRERGQ0UxNzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DOTY', 'className': 'CORONAVIRUSES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DOTH', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000912', 'className': 'INFECTIOUS DISEASE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000166', 'className': 'INSOLVENCY & BANKRUPTCY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjgyMjE5QTNFOEJFNEU1MUI5RDFGNTU0RjRBMzI3MkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTNCNURBMjAwMTdCNDU0NjhDREEwOUE4MUI1M0FFREI', 'className': 'Medicare'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DOXW', 'className': 'PANDEMICS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008X60', 'className': 'SOCIAL SECURITY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX002145', 'className': 'VIRUSES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DQGE', 'className': 'COVID CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001688', 'className': 'TAXES & TAXATION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUQ4NThEMTk0MTQ4NDM3N0FGOEM5RkU2QUQ4RjA1MkQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OENGNTY0MEQ2RTU2NDA2NTk4QjcyNzI2NTBERUU3NUI', 'className': 'Trusts'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008X8R', 'className': 'US SOCIAL SECURITY'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'STX001426', 'className': 'PUBLIC DEBT'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00090NT', 'className': 'ECONOMIC CONDITIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001937', 'className': 'ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001959', 'className': 'PUBLIC FINANCE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001493', 'className': 'RETIREMENT & RETIREES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000A6OA', 'className': 'SENIOR CITIZENS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009ERN', 'className': 'TREASURY DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0008WT3', 'className': 'VULNERABLE HEALTH POPULATIONS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001457', 'className': 'RECESSION'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCX', 'className': 'US DEMOCRATIC PARTY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009TD5', 'className': 'US REPUBLICAN PARTY'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DLOJ', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST00097CL', 'className': 'PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX000152', 'className': 'BABY BOOMERS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST0008WZ5', 'className': 'NATIONAL DEBT'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NThFNzVCQTRENzQ4NEIxQzkyQjVFQTI5NUY5QjE3RTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTU2Q0MxMTdBQjEzNDE4NDhCMEM2RDRBNkJCQUQyNjU', 'className': 'C Corporations'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjgyMjE5QTNFOEJFNEU1MUI5RDFGNTU0RjRBMzI3MkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTNCNURBMjAwMTdCNDU0NjhDREEwOUE4MUI1M0FFREI', 'className': 'Medicare'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009ERN', 'className': 'TREASURY DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'N541612ME', 'className': 'ACTUARIAL SERVICES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST00097CL', 'className': 'PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX002149', 'className': 'HEALTH CARE'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009T96'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTM4NzQwMkQwQkUyNEVDRTg0QjUxNDQ2NTkwRDVGRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTUxRjY2QkZCMjhBNDJENTg2QzJGQUQ1MTAyMEI5RkI', 'className': 'Disability Insurance'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DEIB', 'className': 'JANET YELLEN'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJK', 'className': 'JOE BIDEN'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'PE000DEDM', 'className': 'KAMALA HARRIS'}], 'country': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

As a rookie, he missed the first eight games  on injured reserve. RB-WR Perry is claimed The Patriots claimed Malcolm Perry off waivers from the  Dolphins. To make room on the 53-man roster, they  released linebacker Harvey Langi. Perry, who played quarterback at Navy, has transitioned to both wide receiver and running back in the NFL. The Dolphins drafted him in the seventh round (246th overall) in 2020, but the Patriots also seemed to consider the possibility. ""There's a big tie with Navy and Coach [Bill] Belichick,"" Perry said after getting drafted. ""I talked to him quite a few times. They probably showed the most interest."" Hoyer among returnees None of the players the Patriots released were claimed via waivers, which meant they were able to bring back several familiar faces to their 16-man practice squad. Nine players who participated in training camp will return:  Quarterback Brian Hoyer, wide receivers Tre Nixon and Kristian Wilkerson, tight end Matt LaCosse, defensive backs Myles Bryant and D'Angelo Ross, defensive linemen Tashawn Bower and Bill Murray, and offensive lineman Alex Redmond. New faces joining them on the practice squad include linebacker Jahlani Tavai and fullback Ben Mason. Patriots senior football adviser Matt Patricia is familiar with Tavai, as the  Lions drafted the 24-year-old Hawaii grad in the second round in 2019. Belichick indicated Wednesday morning there are still plenty of moves to come this week. ""The roster-building process is far from complete,"" he said. ""There's a lot of movement still to go.

13,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",CRIME & COURTS,,Mass. officials blast restrictive Texas law banning most abortions in state,,Travis Andersen,"Link to Image Advocates and elected officials in Massachusetts on Wednesday blasted a Texas law banning most abortions in the Lone Star State that took effect at midnight.  Among the groups that support abortion rights that strongly criticized the Texas law was NARAL Pro-Choice MA, which tweeted Wednesday that the measure ""gives politicians, neighbors, and even strangers the right to sue those who provide - or just help patients get - abortion after 6 [weeks]. They won't stop with Texas. If we don't fight back, we could see similar restrictions across the country."" Massachusetts Attorney Maura Healey also took aim at the law.","FULL TEXT ""Texas' radical new abortion ban forces powerless patients to carry pregnancies, regardless of rape or incest, or have their doctors & families threatened with legal action,"" Healey tweeted Wednesday. ""We will fight this latest effort to overturn Roe v. Wade & stand up for freedom, privacy, and basic rights."" Representative Ayanna Pressley, a Boston Democrat and leading member of the so-called Squad of progressive female members of Congress, tweeted Wednesday that Texas lawmakers had failed their constituents by enacting such a restrictive abortion law. ""When states like Texas fail the people, When the courts fail the people, Congress must LEAD,"" Pressley tweeted. ""We must #ActForAbortionAccess."" Her words were echoed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Cambridge Democrat who unsuccessfully sought her party's presidential nomination last year. ""The Texas abortion ban is an unconstitutional attack on reproductive rights - an attack happening all across America,"" Warren tweeted. ""Let's be very clear: We're going to fight this ban and defend #RoeVWade."" Another Massachusetts politician voicing anger over the Texas law was state Senator Jamie Eldridge, an Acton Democrat. ""Outraged by Texas enacting this law severely restricting abortion rights, incl/ banning abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy & allowing individuals to bring civil lawsuits against abortion providers,"" Eldridge tweeted. ""An injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" The Texas law stands as the most the most dramatic restriction on abortion rights in the country since the Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion across the country in 1973. The high court was silent Wednesday on an emergency appeal to put the Texas law on hold. Republican Governor Greg Abbott in May signed the Texas measure into law. It bars abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before most women know they're pregnant. ""As we knew would happen, thanks to a politically manipulated #SCOTUS, Texas now bans almost all #abortions,"" tweeted Mass. state Senator Becca Rausch, a Needham Democrat, on Wednesday. ""1st time since #RoeVWade that a state successfully banned #abortion early in pregnancy."" In Massachusetts, abortion rights are more secure. The state last year passed the ROE Act, which made it into law at the end of 2020 over Governor Charlie Baker's veto. It codified and expanded the right to abortion in Massachusetts.

14,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,When will the Delta surge end?,,,"Link to Image The United States has entered the fourth wave of the pandemic - or fifth, depending on which expert you ask. As the vaccination campaign lags and the contagious delta variant spreads, cases and hospitalizations are at their highest since last winter. COVID-19 deaths, too, are on a steady incline. After every other peak has come a trough, however, often for reasons that were not immediately obvious. In Britain, where the variant is also the dominant form of the coronavirus, daily cases fell from a peak of 60,000 in mid-July to half that within two weeks, though they have since been climbing again.","FULL TEXT In India, the numbers spiked to more than 400,000 daily cases this spring; experts estimated that the true figure could be more than 20 times greater. The unimaginable toll shocked many who had declared that the country had successfully eluded the virus. But then, in June, infections fell drastically. Scientists are struggling to understand why delta outbreaks in those countries dissipated, even if temporarily, and what that may mean for similar surges, including the one in the U.S. In the U.S., the variant's pace has slowed, and new infections are falling in some states, like Missouri, that delta struck hard. The number of infections over the last week is now 14% higher than it was two weeks ago, a fraction of the rate during much of July and early August. Is the delta surge beginning to slow in the U.S.? Or is the variant putting the country on course for months of bumps and valleys? Expert opinion varies widely on the direction of the virus in the coming months. A number of national forecasts being tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predict that cases will rise in the early weeks of September - but many foresee the opposite. ""Whatever downturn we have, I think, will be fairly mild,"" said Dr. Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York. ""We're right at that tipping point where back-to-school will tip us back into growth at some point."" Gounder predicted that cases in the U.S. would climb again in September before subsiding in October. The virus may have burned through unvaccinated segments of the population this summer, Gounder said, but other people remained vulnerable. ""I don't think that means that everybody who was susceptible has been infected,"" she said. ""I think people tend to have a false sense of security about that."" As schoolchildren and some office workers begin mixing in greater numbers this fall, for example, resurgences may appear, she said. Other epidemiologists said that they were encouraged by trends in Southern states where schools had already opened, noting that while infections were growing among children, they were also falling off among adults. It is important ""not to overly extrapolate"" from delta's course through Britain and India, Gounder added. The three countries vary greatly in the percentage of population vaccinated, the ages of the vaccinated, the embrace of large gatherings and open schools, and the prevalence of mask-wearing and other precautions. Even the weather may be playing a role. Britain's infections thinned in the summer, while the U.S. is heading into fall with a huge burden of cases. More people gathering indoors will mean more opportunities for the virus to spread. Delta's path across the U.S. has depended heavily upon vaccination rates, social behaviors, the weather and various levels of precautions, epidemiologists said. Week on week, cases are now falling in a number of Southeastern states and California, but rising across much of the Midwest and Northeast. The variant is thought to be more contagious than previous versions of the coronavirus because the infected carry it in substantially greater amounts in their airways. This makes the variant particularly adept at exploiting opportunities for transmission - the crowded nightclub, the classroom with an unmasked teacher. But it also means that even modest restrictions, like masking and distancing, can bring numbers back down.",['ENGLISH'],723,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-DGWRDUESCFH5BNCVPQHLEAEMRU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DOTH', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX002064', 'className': 'EPIDEMICS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000912', 'className': 'INFECTIOUS DISEASE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DOXW', 'className': 'PANDEMICS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001880', 'className': 'PUBLIC HEALTH'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000511', 'className': 'DISEASES & DISORDERS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX002233', 'className': 'EPIDEMIOLOGY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX002144', 'className': 'VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001785', 'className': 'VACCINES'}, {'score': '84', 'classCode': 'STX000290', 'className': 'CHILDREN'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DOTY', 'className': 'CORONAVIRUSES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DQGE', 'className': 'COVID CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N923120CC', 'className': 'PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Federal Government'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000COUY', 'className': 'PREVENTION & WELLNESS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX002145', 'className': 'VIRUSES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001759', 'className': 'TRENDS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST000DIF5', 'className': 'ADULTS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX002233', 'className': 'EPIDEMIOLOGY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX002144', 'className': 'VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001785', 'className': 'VACCINES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS148', 'className': 'NEW YORK, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'GC304', 'className': 'INDIA'}]}"

The figure fell short of all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The weaker-than-expected hiring gain suggests firms are still struggling to attract applicants and fill a record number of vacant positions. At the same time, the Delta variant could present additional headwinds to hiring if consumer spending on services like dining out pulls back meaningfully. Service-provider employment increased 329,000 in August. Payrolls at leisure and hospitality businesses advanced 201,000 during the month. Employment at goods producers was up 45,000, led by a 30,000 jump in construction. ""The delta variant of Covid-19 appears to have dented the job market recovery,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said in a statement. ""Job growth remains strong, but well off the pace of recent months."" The combined payroll gain in July and August was the slowest since the start of the year, according to ADP. The figures come just before the government's monthly jobs report, and economists expect private payrolls to advance by 652,000 in August.

16,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,"Officers, paramedics charged in Elijah McClain's 2019 death",,,"Link to Image DENVER (AP) - Colorado's attorney general said Wednesday that a grand jury indicted three officers and two paramedics in the death of Elijah McClain, a Black man who was put in a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative two years ago in suburban Denver. The 23-year-old's death gained widespread attention during last year's protests against racial injustice and police brutality following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.","FULL TEXT McClain's pleading words that were captured on police body camera video - ""I'm just different"" - have been posted on signs at protests and spoken by celebrities who have joined those calling for the prosecution of the officers who confronted McClain as he walked down the street in the city of Aurora after a 911 caller reported he looked suspicious. Stories about McClain, a massage therapist family and friends described as a gentle and kind introvert, filled social media, including how he volunteered to play his violin to comfort cats at an animal shelter. Attorney General Phil Weiser said all five officers and paramedics were charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, while some also face additional charges. Facing pressure during nationwide protests last year, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered Weiser to open a new criminal investigation. A district attorney had said in 2019 that he could not charge the officers because an autopsy could not determine how McClain died. In January, Weiser announced that he had opened a grand jury investigation, noting that grand juries have the power to compel testimony and documents that would otherwise be unavailable. It was one of several investigations prompted at least in part by McClain's death, including separate reviews of McClain's arrest commissioned by the city of Aurora and a comprehensive review of the Police Department. The attorney general's office also is conducting a civil rights investigation into the agency, the first under a new police accountability law in Colorado. Aurora's highly critical review did not find any evidence to justify officers stopping McClain as he walked home from the store on Aug. 24, 2019, after a 911 caller had reported a man wearing a ski mask and waving his hands who seemed ""sketchy."" His family said McClain wore the mask because he had anemia that caused him to get cold easily. Police body camera video shows an officer getting out of his car, approaching McClain on the sidewalk and saying, ""Stop right there. Stop. Stop ... I have a right to stop you because you're being suspicious."" In the video, the officer puts his hand on McClain's shoulder and turns him around and repeats, ""Stop tensing up."" As McClain verbally protests, the officer says, ""Relax, or I'm going to have to change this situation."" As the other officers join in to restrain McClain, he asks them to let go and says, ""You guys started to arrest me, and I was stopping my music to listen."" What happened next isn't clear because all of the officers' body cameras come off as they move McClain to the grass, but the officers and McClain can still be heard. An officer says McClain grabbed one of their guns. McClain can be heard trying to explain himself and sometimes crying out or sobbing. He says he can't breathe and was just on his way home. ""I'm just different. I'm just different, that's all. That's all I was doing. I'm so sorry. I have no gun. I don't do that stuff. I don't do any fighting. Why were you attacking me? I don't do guns. I don't even kill flies. I don't eat meat. ... I am a vegetarian,"" he said. One officer eventually retrieves his camera, which shows McClain handcuffed, laying on his side and periodically vomiting as another officer leans on him. An officer who arrived later threatened to get his police dog to bite McClain. Paramedics arrived and injected the 140-pound (63.5-kilogram) McClain with 500 milligrams of ketamine - more than 1 1/2 times the dose for his weight. The fire department is allowed to use the drug to sedate combative or aggressive people, but there's a lack of police training, conflicting medical standards and nonexistent protocols that have resulted in hospitalizations and even deaths when it's used during police encounters. Within five minutes, according to a federal lawsuit from McClain's family, he stopped breathing. He died six days later after being declared brain dead and taken off life support. A pathologist who conducted an autopsy said a combination of a narrowed coronary artery and physical exertion contributed to McClain's death. Dr. Stephen Cina found no evidence of a ketamine overdose and said several other possibilities could not be ruled out, including an unexpected reaction to ketamine or the chokehold causing an irregular heartbeat. The carotid hold that was used on McClain involves applying pressure to the sides of the neck, stopping the flow of blood to the brain to render someone unconscious. It has been banned by police departments and some states, including Colorado, following Floyd's killing. A lawsuit from the family alleges that McClain died as a result of a dramatic increase of lactic acid in his blood caused by excessive force used by police over about 18 minutes, combined with the effects of the ketamine. They claim that police continued to ""torture"" McClain even after he was restrained, treatment they say is a result of the department's history of ""unconstitutional racist brutality."" The attorney general's announcement comes after three Aurora officers, including one involved in the encounter with McClain, were fired and one resigned last year over photos mimicking the chokehold used on the 23-year-old. The department's new chief, who fired those officers as its interim leader, has vowed to work to rebuild public trust since McClain's death and other police encounters with people of color. However, Vanessa Wilson spent her first days as chief last year apologizing after Aurora officers put four Black girls on the ground and handcuffed two of them next to a car that police suspected was stolen but turned out not to be. A prosecutor later decided there was no evidence the officers committed a crime but urged the Police Department to review its policies to ensure that something similar does not happen again.

Dr. Ankeet S. Bhatt, a clinical and research fellow at the Brigham's Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, served as lead author and cochair of the committee that wrote the statement, along with Dr. Anuradha Lala of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. ""Patients with heart failure are uniquely susceptible to adverse outcomes in the setting of COVID-19 infection, highlighting the importance of vaccination,"" the statement said. Brigham and Women's said the society's statement discussed such questions as the effect of COVID-19 on patients with histories of heart failure, the implications for heart transplants, and concerns about COVID-19-related myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. The Brigham said the society's statement also addressed lingering questions about the effects of COVID-19 and described persistent cardiac symptoms and evidence of cardiac injury that may occur during post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, more commonly known as ""long COVID."" The society's statement was posted Wednesday to the Journal of Cardiac Failure's website. It says that in ""a retrospective analysis of over 8 million individuals with HF [heart failure] from the National Inpatient Sample, those diagnosed with influenza during hospitalization had higher rates of in-hospital mortality, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure even after propensity matching. Together, these data identified patients with HF as possibly more vulnerable to serious adverse events associated with COVID-19."" And here's what the research team said, in part, about the challenging issue of transplants: ""Heart transplantation and non-urgent surgical, electrophysiology, and catheter procedures for HF should likely be deferred if a candidate tests positive"" via PCR test. Heart failure occurs when the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it is supposed to.

18,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",LIFESTYLE,,I guess we're all introverts now?,,Meredith Goldstein,"Link to Image The other night I saw my close friend Sara. We ate dinner and watched cartoons, which is something we did a lot before the pandemic. When I returned home, grateful it felt safe to see each other in person, I fought the urge to send her an apology text. ""Sorry I was weird tonight!"" Or maybe, ""Sorry I was so tired tonight!"" I started typing my favorite 2021 message: ""Hope I didn't seem off!""","FULL TEXT Our evening together was light and fun, but maybe I was awkward. To be honest, I can't figure out whether my introversion and mild social anxiety, which seems more pronounced after 2020, is preventing me from being my usual self, whatever that means. Lately, I'm insecure about most of my interactions, especially with those closest to me. I could send a ""sorry that was awkward/tense/weird/uncomfortable"" message after every friend-date, if I let myself. Last month, as I noticed this ""am I weird?"" question wasn't going away, I found myself looking for books about introversion. I've always been a very extroverted introvert; I need a lot of alone time, but I can speak in front of a crowd if I need to, and I have no trouble making friends. But in 2021, my old talents seem muted. I know I'm not alone. Even if you were a bold extrovert before COVID-19, you're probably experiencing some social second-guessing now. The main source of support I found for my worries was in a memoir/guide called ""Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want to Come"" by Jessica Pan, who writes that she's a ""shintrovert"" (""shy introvert"") raised by social parents, a Jewish mom and Chinese dad. ""I love my parents. I do,"" she writes, adding that her parents will ""talk to anyone: flight seatmates, waiters ... My father is the most unpredictable: I've seen him hit the ground in hotel lobbies to show doormen how to improve their push-up form, ask a Polish waitress whether she missed her family deeply and regretted moving to London, and discuss circumcision rates in the US versus the UK at my own wedding. With my new British in-laws. Whom he'd met the night before."" Pan, a Brown University grad who lives in London now, starts the book as a person most likely to leave a party. She's the opposite of her dad. She doesn't want to be lonely, but company isn't always easy. Had I read her memoir when it came out in 2019, I would have thought, ""She seems nice, but I'm nothing like her."" In 2021, however, I found myself deeply connected to every line, scribbling down the tips she culls from behavioral scientists about how to initiate interaction without overthinking. The premise of ""Sorry I'm Late"" is that Pan forces herself to try extroverted things. She speaks in front of audiences. She has a hilarious journey starting conversations with strangers in London. She networks. In every situation, she tells you how it went and what she learned. For the most part, she learns that socialization is not so scary once you try it and realize the worst-case scenario is not that bad. Some risks she takes in the book are irrelevant at the moment. I'm not sure anyone needs to figure out how to host or navigate a big party just yet. But much of her story is applicable to now - so relevant to the ways many of us got used to Zooming with loved ones, being alone, and living without the small conversations that happened in an office or at a coffee shop. My biggest takeaway from the book was something I've experienced since 2020 but couldn't explain until reading Pan's story. Pan learns that her interactions with strangers are better when they're the opposite of small talk - when she allows even small conversations to be transparent and personal. Genuine connections, even with someone she'll never meet again, leave her feeling elated. Behavioral scientists confirm this will be the case, and that strangers who seem opposed to chatting actually do want to engage, as long as the back-and-forth is genuine. One test of this theory has Pan talking to a man named Claude on a train. The interaction starts small, and then she listens to his personal stories, and it works on both sides. ""I'm also shocked to discover that talking to strangers turns out to be one of the cheapest, easiest ways to feel good and get a hit of dopamine when you're feeling low, or lost in your own world,"" she writes. ""When Claude and I parted ways at the Gare du Nord, he said, 'I never do this but I wish I did. This journey passed like a dream. (He's French, so he's allowed to say things like this.)"" I've experienced the same with strangers this year. I've found myself in deep conversations with the woman who's delivered my groceries through an app since mid-2020 (I now call her a friend). I've had weird bonding talks with people at call centers who I'll never meet in person. I never feel awkward about having deep talk with strangers. What feels strange, these days, is keeping it light, especially when I'm with my close friends. Are we allowed to do that? Keep it light? When so much isn't? I think that's why I want to text apologies after nights out with my loved ones. Maybe what I'm really asking is: ""Is it OK that we didn't talk about the 15 global elephants in the room?"" Maybe I got too good at talking about big things, and I'll have to practice being breezy using some of the stories in Pan's book as a guide. Because breezy is good, too. Breezy doesn't have to mean small talk; it can also mean fun. Silliness. Sitting around and watching cartoons. Maybe you'll pull different lessons from ""Sorry I'm Late."" Regardless, it's a very funny read, and it made me feel like I'm part of a world of second-guessers just trying to do their best right now. The book also makes a lovely gift. I would like to be Pan's friend, but the thought of that would probably stress her out. So I'll just wave from here.

19,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",WORLD,,"It's election season in Germany. No charisma, please!",,,"BERLIN - The most popular politician who would like to be chancellor isn't on the ballot. The leading candidate is so boring people compare him to a machine. Instead of ""Yes, We Can!"" voters are being fired up with promises of ""Stability."" Germany is having its most important election in a generation but you would never know it. The newspaper Die Welt recently asked in a headline: ""Is this the most boring election ever?""","FULL TEXT Yes and no. The campaign to replace Chancellor Angela Merkel after 16 years of her dominating German and European politics is the tightest in Germany since 2005, and it just got tighter. The Social Democrats, written off as recently as a month ago, have overtaken Merkel's conservatives for the first time in years. But the campaign has also revealed a charisma vacuum that is at once typical of postwar German politics and exceptional for just how bland Merkel's two most likely successors are. No party is polling more than 25 percent, and for much of the race the candidate the public has preferred was none of the above. Whoever wins, however, will have the job of shepherding the continent's largest economy, making that person one of Europe's most important leaders, which has left some observers wondering if the charisma deficit will extend to a leadership deficit as well. While the election outcome may be exciting, the two leading candidates are anything but. Less than a month before the vote, the field is being led by two male suit-wearing career politicians - one balding, one bespectacled, both over 60 - who represent the parties that have governed the country jointly for the better part of two decades. There is Armin Laschet, governor of the western state of North-Rhine Westphalia, who is running for Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats. And then there is Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat who is Merkel's finance minister and vice chancellor. The candidate of change, Annalena Baerbock, the 40-year-old coleader of the Greens, has a bold reform agenda and plenty of verve - and has been lagging in the polls after a brief surge before the summer. It's a nail-biter, German-style: Who can most effectively channel stability and continuity? Or put another way: Who can channel Merkel? For now it seems to be Scholz - a man Germans have long known as the ""Scholz-o-mat"" or the ""Scholz machine"" - a technocrat and veteran politician who can seem almost robotically on message. Where others have slipped up in the campaign, he has avoided mistakes, mostly by saying very little. ""Most citizens know who I am,"" was Scholz's pitch to his party before being anointed chancellor candidate, conspicuously echoing Merkel's iconic 2013 line to voters: ""You know me."" More recently, one of his campaign ads showed his reassuring smile with a caption using the female form of the word chancellor, telling voters that he has what it takes to lead the country even though he is a man. ""Angela the second,"" was the title of a Scholz profile in the magazine Der Spiegel this week. Scholz has tried so hard to perfect the art of embodying the chancellor's aura of stability and calm that he has even been photographed holding his hands before him in the chancellor's signature diamond shape - making what is known as the Merkel rhombus. ""Scholz is trying to be Merkel's clone all the way down to the rhombus,"" said John Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany who has lived in Berlin on and off since the 1960s. ""The guy everyone likes best is the most boring guy in the election - maybe in the country. He makes watching water boil seem exciting."" But Germans, political observers point out, love boring. ""There are few countries where such a premium is put on being dull,"" said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European history at the University of Oxford, who has written about the country. It's not that Germans are resistant to charisma. When Barack Obama was running for president and delivered a rousing speech at the victory column in Berlin in 2008, 100,000 Germans cheered him on. But they don't want it in their own politicians. That's because the last time Germany had a rousing leader it didn't end well, noted Jan Böhmermann, a popular TV host and comedian. The haunting memory of Hitler's Nazi party winning office in free elections has shaped Germany's postwar democracy in various ways, Böhmermann said, ""and one of them is that charisma is banned from politics."" Andrea Römmele, dean of the Berlin-based Hertie School, put it this way: ""A Trump character could never become chancellor here."" Paradoxically, that's at least in part thanks to an electoral system bequeathed to Germany by the United States and its Allies after World War II. Unlike in the American presidential system, German voters don't get to elect their chancellor directly. They vote for parties; the parties' share of the vote determines their share of the seats in Parliament; and then Parliament elects the chancellor. And because it just about always takes more than one party to form a government - and this time probably three - you can't be too rude about the people you might rely on to be your coalition partners. ""Your rival today might be your finance minister tomorrow,"" Römmele said. As for the chancellor candidates, they are not chosen in primaries but by party officials who tend to pick people like themselves: career politicians who have given years of service to the party machine. Being good on television and connecting with voters doesn't cut it, said Jürgen Falter, an electoral expert at the University of Mainz. ""It's a strict oligarchic system,"" he said. ""If we had primaries, Markus Söder would have been the candidate."" Söder, Bavaria's ambitious governor, has heaps of beer-tent charisma and is the most popular politician in the country after Merkel herself. He was eager to run for chancellor, but the conservatives picked Laschet, a longstanding Merkel ally, not least, Römmele said, because at the time he looked most like ""the continuity candidate."" Recent polls give Scholz's Social Democrats the edge with between 23-25 percent, followed by 20-22 percent for Laschet's Christian Democrats, or CDU, and around 17 percent for the Greens.",['ENGLISH'],1071,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-FVCE3K2UYBC7XGPJGYD6MCVF2M,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Constitutional Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D3DQ', 'className': 'GERMAN POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DQNG', 'className': 'SOCIALISM'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001812', 'className': 'VOTERS & VOTING'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000CYBP', 'className': 'CONSERVATISM'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DHPL', 'className': 'GERMAN CHANCELLORS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001347', 'className': 'POLLS & SURVEYS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DLOJ', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX000512', 'className': 'DISMISSALS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX001959', 'className': 'PUBLIC FINANCE'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX001937', 'className': 'ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009UHD', 'className': 'ANGELA MERKEL'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX121', 'className': 'BERLIN, GERMANY'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS016', 'className': 'NORDRHEIN-WESTFALEN, GERMANY'}], 'country': [{'score': '97', 'classCode': 'GC318', 'className': 'GERMANY'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GT115', 'className': 'EUROPE'}]}"
20,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,Here's what to know about the abortion law now in effect in Texas,,Amanda Kaufman,"Link to Image A law in Texas that bans abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy - before many women even know they are pregnant - went into effect early Wednesday, becoming one of the strictest abortion measures in the country. While the Supreme Court may still rule on the measure, which contradicts precedents set by the landmark Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey decisions, the high court has so far been silent.","FULL TEXT Here's what to know about the new law. What does the law do? The measure bans abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks into pregnancy. The law provides an exemption for ""medical emergencies"" but it does not have an exception when there is rape or incest. The law was passed by the Texas House and Senate in mid-May and signed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott a few days later. It took effect on Sept. 1 after the Supreme Court failed to block it. What makes this law different from previous measures seeking to restrict abortions? The law was designed to make it difficult to be challenged in the courts because it prevents public officials from enforcing it, instead allowing private individuals to sue abortion providers or anyone who ""aids or abets"" the newly illegal abortions. That description extends to people who drive the person to the procedure, or help pay for it, among other situations. At least one anti-abortion group has set up a website where people can anonymously submit tips about potential violations. Instead of imposing a punishment for those who perform abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, the law allows anyone who helps a person obtain the procedure to sue. Anyone who successfully sues another person under the law would be entitled to at least $10,000. Abortion rights advocates say the measure creates confusion over who to sue in court. A lawsuit would typically name state officials as defendants, allowing plaintiffs to sue the officials who are responsible for enforcing the law. ""SB 8 effectively puts a bounty on anyone who supports a pregnant person seeking abortion care after about 6 weeks in pregnancy,"" Adrienne Kimmell, acting president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement denouncing the law. In an emergency request on Monday that asked the Supreme Court to block the measure, abortion providers in the state said it ""would immediately and irreparably decimate abortion access in Texas, barring care for at least 85% of Texas abortion patients (those who are six weeks pregnant or greater) and likely forcing many abortion clinics to ultimately close."" Similar laws banning abortions after six weeks that have been passed in states like Kentucky and Georgia have been blocked by federal courts. Abortion rights advocates fear that other states will take the court's silence on the Texas law as tacit approval and pass similar measures. Abortion providers described a scramble to perform procedures in the hours before the law took effect On Tuesday night, abortion clinics in Texas were filled with patients seeking the procedure hours before the law went into effect. Amy Hagstrom Miller, CEO of Whole Women's Health, which has four abortion clinics in the state, wrote on Twitter after 10 p.m. on Tuesday night that the waiting rooms were ""filled with patients and their loved ones,"" and its staff would work up until the minute the law went into effect. The last abortion at one of her clinics finished at 11:56 p.m. in Fort Worth, according to The Associated Press. Whole Women's Health also tweeted that anti-abortion activists were outside the clinic.",['ENGLISH'],634,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-GK3CMSJ5LZGHBONHUHT54IOBJM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '99', 'classCode': 'STX000002', 'className': 'ABORTION'}, {'score': '94', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDJERTczQzQxNDBENEQ4RDlCRjNGNUMyMjg0NEI0NjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjM2NTg4ODQ2MEU0NENDOUE4NzlDN0E2QjM5MjJFQjg', 'className': 'Abortion'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N922110CC', 'className': 'LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001020', 'className': 'LEGISLATION'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001366', 'className': 'PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009ZVD', 'className': 'SUPREME COURTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N621410MM', 'className': 'REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CLINICS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001648', 'className': 'SUITS & CLAIMS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000694', 'className': 'FAMILY PLANNING'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N922120CC', 'className': 'LAW ENFORCEMENT'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDJERTczQzQxNDBENEQ4RDlCRjNGNUMyMjg0NEI0NjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjM2NTg4ODQ2MEU0NENDOUE4NzlDN0E2QjM5MjJFQjg', 'className': 'Abortion'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N621410MM', 'className': 'REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CLINICS'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DHIK', 'className': 'GREG ABBOTT'}], 'state': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'GS159', 'className': 'TEXAS, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

22,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,How technology cracked the case of a missing Camry,,Hiawatha Bray,"Link to Image When Tarikh Campbell stepped out of his boyhood home in Teaneck, N.J.,  last month, the parking space where he'd left his 2020 Toyota Camry was a patch of empty pavement. His Avis rental car had apparently been stolen. Campbell, an East Boston resident and program manager for workplace inclusion at Microsoft in Cambridge, didn't get much help from Avis, or the local police. So he set about to figure out the car's fate himself, with a welcome assist from some digital gadgets that just happened to be in the right place at the right time.","FULL TEXT When he discovered the theft on the night of Aug. 14, ""I was freaked out, like, rubbing my eyes,"" said Campbell. He'd gone to Teaneck in mid-August for a relaxing weekend visit and had planned to spend Saturday night hanging out with friends. Instead, he found himself filing a stolen car report with the Teaneck police. The next morning, he took a Lyft to the Avis office near the Newark airport. As he handed over the keys to the missing car, a customer service worker told Campbell that he would be charged daily rental fees. The worker said that the car didn't contain a GPS tracker, so Avis couldn't help find it. And the worker added, ""If we don't find the car, you're going to be liable for it,"" Campbell recalled. ""I was pretty stressed out about that."" Campbell filed a claim with his personal auto insurance company, but he was warned that the payout might not cover the full cost of the rental car, which was newer than his own vehicle. In addition, he could expect to pay higher insurance premiums going forward. Insured or not, the loss of the car could cost him dearly. After flying home to Boston, Campbell remembered something he'd left behind in the car: his E-ZPass transponder for making automatic payments for road tolls. Realizing that the E-ZPass billing system automatically tracks a vehicle's movements along toll roads, he logged on to his account, and found that the missing Camry had indeed traveled on the New Jersey Turnpike that Saturday night. ""It got off the highway at the Newark airport exit,"" said Campbell. The next break in the case came from Campbell's aunt, whom he'd visited during the trip and who lived three doors down from Campbell's parents. The aunt had installed a video surveillance camera on her porch, which had a good view down the street. Recorded video from the camera showed a tow truck scooping up the vehicle and carting it away. But the car was legally parked. Who would have towed it? Car thieves? ""We weren't entertaining the idea that there was some organized crime group with tow trucks,"" said Campbell. ""This would most likely be done by Avis."" Combined with the location data from the E-ZPass, it was an open-and-shut case. When Campbell reported the car missing, the Avis worker had said the company couldn't track the car, but he must have been wrong. The company had found the vehicle in Teaneck and hauled it away. And sure enough, Campbell's Avis smartphone app now listed the car as having been returned, 90 minutes after his plane landed back in Boston. Case closed? Not quite. Campbell wanted reimbursement from Avis for his lost weekend, and the return of some personal items he'd left in the car. But phone calls to customer service left him frustrated. The company wouldn't even give him a direct phone number to the Newark rental office. ""I was even hung up on at times by customer service agents,"" Campbell said. Then he unleashed the ultimate weapon: Twitter. On Aug. 20, he cranked out a lengthy thread of tweets about his misadventure, complete with images of the E-Z Pass record and his aunt's surveillance video. The thread went viral, with thousands of likes from sympathetic readers. Avis began to pay attention. The company agreed to a full refund, and a return of his possessions. And it finally revealed what had happened. ""Our internal findings indicate there was an incorrect tow triggered by an administrative error on a previous rental,"" said an e-mail from an Avis spokesperson. ""Mistaken tows occur infrequently but we are taking steps to prevent situations like this from occurring at all in the future."" Like it or not, our lives are now under near-constant electronic surveillance, usually for the benefit of some far-off faceless corporation. But sometimes the digital spies are on our side.",['ENGLISH'],756,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-JBU4FHV7ENDHZAJKQ5RTMM4OTQ,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Transportation Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001793', 'className': 'VEHICLE THEFT'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'N922120QM', 'className': 'POLICE FORCES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000DDQU', 'className': 'SERVICE WORKERS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000DKTF', 'className': 'SURVEILLANCE'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001066', 'className': 'MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000439', 'className': 'CUSTOMER SERVICE'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001860', 'className': 'WORKPLACE DIVERSITY & INCLUSION'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'ST00096KT', 'className': 'BILLING & RECEIVABLES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001659', 'className': 'SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001266', 'className': 'ORGANIZED CRIME'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RURCMEVGMTYyNjAzNDFDM0E0QzBEMjJCNTgxMTc5MUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUQzM0QzNzNGREY4NDcxOEIyRTk4NTM1OTcwMzcwMUY', 'className': 'Parking Facilities'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000CVHY', 'className': 'TOLL ROADS & TURNPIKES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DOOG', 'className': 'CAMERAS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DN5F', 'className': 'ON DEMAND SERVICES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0IxRTFGMjc4NUEzNDI4MEIzMzIxNzNDQTU4NEQwODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTUxRjY2QkZCMjhBNDJENTg2QzJGQUQ1MTAyMEI5RkI', 'className': 'Property Insurance'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEVCQjgwQjFBQjY5NDAxRjg4NTI2NDYyNDdBREM1Mjk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTUxRjY2QkZCMjhBNDJENTg2QzJGQUQ1MTAyMEI5RkI', 'className': 'Motor Vehicle Insurance'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0008XK6', 'className': 'PERSONAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000DOZN', 'className': 'ROAD TRANSPORTATION & TRANSIT FEES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'N524000CC', 'className': 'INSURANCE'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkE5N0U0RkQwM0VENDRCRjkzN0M3RjA1Qjg4OEJERDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDQ0MzAyMTAyNjY5NDRENEFDMzkyRjFDRUE4ODVGQjg', 'className': 'Premiums'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000A2VZ'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'N488400CC', 'className': 'ROAD TRANSPORTATION SUPPORT SERVICES'}], 'city': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'GX622', 'className': 'NEWARK, NJ, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '88', 'classCode': 'GS146', 'className': 'NEW JERSEY, USA'}]}"
23,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",TRAVEL,,White-tablecloth service has come back to Amtrak. Here's what it's like,"I hopped aboard the Empire Builder for a ride from Seattle to Chicago, some great views, and lots of good food.",,"Link to Image I hadn't seen my son who lives in Bellingham, Wash., since before the pandemic, and I had never slept on a train, so I decided to visit my son and then take the train from Seattle to Chicago on the way back to Boston. My romantic visions of ""North by Northwest"" and ""Some Like it Hot"" were fueled when I learned that Amtrak was returning some trains to white-tablecloth dining - a glamorous alternative to the prepackaged meals that have been standard fare since 2019. The Empire Builder is one train that has reinstated chef-prepared meals. It travels from Chicago to the Pacific Ocean, wending its way along the Mississippi roughly following the route of Lewis and Clark across the North Dakota plains, through the Wisconsin Dells, and dipping into Glacier National Park. It crosses a bit of Idaho and traverses the rugged terrain of Eastern Washington before it splits at Spokane, where some of the cars head to Seattle and others leave to go through the Columbia Gorge and onto Portland. According to Amtrak's Ridership reports, it's the most popular long-distance route, and many experienced riders claim that it is also the most scenic. Sold!","FULL TEXT After a great visit with my son, I booked a roomette on the Empire Builder headed from Seattle to Chicago. I dropped off my rental car in downtown Seattle and walked a few blocks to King Street Station. Link to Image The Amtrak crew made sure that everyone with sleeping cars got on first (they really do say ""All Aboard!""), and as I collapsed into my tiny roomette, I heard the two whistle blasts signaling that we were on our way. A roomette is more private than a coach seat and less expensive than the slightly larger bedrooms. It's big enough for one person; cramped if there's two. There is a seat that transforms into a lower bunk and a narrow upper bunk that pulls down. Restrooms are shared and there's a shower stocked with towels and soap and with surprisingly good water pressure. Trains are all about schedules, and my car attendant, George, booked me for lunch in the dining car at 12:45. All meals are included with every sleeper car ticket. At the designated time, I walked down the length of the dining car and peeked at the burgers and Caesar salads on other people's plates. Our server, Lori, seated me at a table with another single woman. It was nice to have company. The baked potato topped with vegan chili looked good, and it was delicious. The only disappointment was that it was served on a plastic plate, with ice tea in plastic cups. Link to Image ""They are working on transitioning to china and glassware,"" Lori assured me. ""Come back at the end of the summer!"" After lunch, I took my book and another glass of ice tea to the Lounge Car, but with the breathtaking beauty of the Cascades and the chance to chat with fellow travelers (through masks), I never read a word. George took my dinner reservation for 6:45 and, as promised, there were white tablecloths, blue cloth napkins and fresh flowers on every table. I was seated with a couple from Fort Worth, Texas. We hit it off and all ordered a glass of wine (one is included with every meal) and it was served in real stemware. I ordered the crab and lobster cake for an appetizer. It's Amtrak's signature appetizer for a reason - it's delicious. For an entrée, I picked grilled Atlantic salmon, which was perfectly cooked and nestled on a bed of farro. My tablemates got the signature flat iron steak and the tortellini with pesto cream. Both were fabulous, they said. For dessert we passed around slices of flourless chocolate torte, cheesecake, and carrot cake. These were not made in the kitchen downstairs, but they were rich and wonderful. After dinner we headed to the lounge car, played cards, and watched the sunset over the farms and hills of Central Washington. When I returned to my roomette, George had made up the bed with sheets and a blanket. I climbed in and slept fitfully through the night. Sleeping on a train is not easy. There are lights and bells and whistle stops and some rough tracks. I woke up early and was delighted that there was a coffee station near my roomette. Fortified with caffeine, I lurched my way to the dining car. I was eager have breakfast and find a good seat to view Glacier National Park. Link to Image Breakfast options ranged from yogurt and oatmeal to omelets. I opted for scrambled eggs. Alas! The cloth napkins were replaced with paper and the coffee served in paper cups, but the food was good and I tipped Lori and found a place in the Lounge Car where I could watch Glacier's snowcapped mountains and rushing streams. I saw a moose. By dinnertime, we were entering North Dakota and I could tell that the staff was feeling stressed. The train had picked up more passengers in White Fish and was full. They had run out of some menu items and were completely out of dessert. My hips were grateful, but some passengers weren't as gracious. I ordered the crab cakes again and the chicken breast with wild mushroom risotto. My appetizer never came, and when I mentioned it to the server, Carl from the kitchen appeared with a double portion and an apology. These folks work hard. Link to Image The next morning, after breakfast, I spoke with the chef and her two-person crew. ""We have a 4-foot-by-3-foot grill and some steam trays, and we cook everything from scratch,"" she explained. While lunging along at 70 miles an hour, it can't be easy. Lunch was the last meal aboard. I sat with a college track coach who had great stories and a restrained appetite. He had a salad and I had a grilled cheese with turkey and bacon. We exchanged cards and promised to ""friend"" each other. With Chicago just a few hours away, I packed up my clothes, took a quick shower (still amazed at the water pressure!), tossed my book into my suitcase, and sat down to watch a little more of America pass by. Link to Image If you go . . . These are the room options on the Empire Builder Coach - The most economical choice. No meals are included, and you sleep in your seat. You can walk around the train, buy food from the café car (or pack your own), and enjoy the view from the lounge car. Roomette - Sleeps two people compactly. The upper bunk is bare bones with no windows and a strap so that no one falls out when the train lurches. There are shared lavatories and a shower in the hallway. All meals, a complimentary coffee station, and water are included with a roomette. Also included is access to the lounge at major train stations. Bedrooms - Larger than roomettes, bedrooms have a slightly larger bottom bunk as well as a private toilet with a tiny shower and sink. Meals and access to station lounges included. Superliner Bedroom Suite - Two connecting rooms that sleep 3-4 people with twice the room of a regular bedroom and two private restrooms. Meals and access to station lounges included. Family Bedroom - Sleeps up to two adults and two kids with a private restroom and shower. There's room for luggage, too. Meals and access to station lounges included.

24,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,"How the Delta variant stole Christmas: empty shelves, long waits - and yes, higher prices",,,"Link to Image More than 1 million Rainbow High dolls are primed for the holidays - but first they need to make it out of China. The popular toys have already overcome their share of hurdles, including short-staffed factories and record-high plastic prices. But now there's a shortage of the shipping containers that ferry them from Asian factories, warehouses, and ports, to American fulfillment centers and stores. ''I'm afraid there is simply not enough time to get products on the shelf this year,'' said Isaac Larian, chief executive of MGA Entertainment, the toy giant behind Rainbow High and such popular lines as L.O.L. Surprise and Little Tikes. ''The holidays are going to be very tough and, frankly, a lot of families are not going to be able to get the toys they want.''","FULL TEXT Mounting challenges - including factory shutdowns, computer chip shortages, and clogged ports - are rattling the industry as it prepares for the crucial holiday shopping season, an eight-week window that can account for more than half of a retailer's annual sales. The rapid spread of the Delta variant adds to the uncertainty: It already has forced a two-week shutdown of a terminal in one of China's busiest ports, and halted operations at one-third of Vietnam's garment and textile factories. And there are signs that consumers are pulling back. Retail sales took a hit in July, with Americans spending less on clothing, cars, and furniture as Delta took hold. The Biden administration has signaled that smoothing out the supply chain is a growing priority. Last week, the White House appointed a port envoy to address congestion at US ports while the recent bipartisan infrastructure deal includes $17 billion in investments for port infrastructure. But those efforts are unlikely to offer much reprieve before the upcoming busy season. Analysts say they expect widespread shortages, less selection, and higher prices for a number of popular holiday gifts, including gaming consoles, TVs, toys, and sneakers. ''COVID has turned supply chains on their head,'' said Neel Jones Shah, global head of airfreight for Flexport, a logistics technology company. ''We're seeing an astronomical rise in shipping rates, a dramatic lengthening of transit times, and a logjam of cargo at every port. Shippers are scrambling to figure out how to get their goods to market in time for the Christmas selling season.'' Two of the nation's largest retailers, Walmart and Home Depot, are chartering their own ships to retrieve their products while Amazon is beefing up its fleet of cargo planes. Urban Outfitters is switching from ocean freight to air in hopes of bypassing clogged ports in the run-up to the holidays. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Other brands are recalibrating to avoid the frenzy: Book publishers, dogged by paper shortages and shipping delays, are pushing fall releases into early next year. ''Everybody is in the same boat, saying, 'How do we ensure a supply of goods? What is most critical? What can we do without?''' said Robert Gerwig, senior vice president of distribution and logistics at Sweetwater, which sells musical instruments and audio technology. ''They're rapidly looking for other options to ensure goods are delivered in time.'' With weeks to go before summer slips into fall, store shelves already are sparse: At Walmart and Williams-Sonoma, executives say more items are out of stock than usual. Apparel chain Anthropologie is running low on dresses and jeans. Many retailers are whittling down their toy and clothing inventories, offering fewer styles, colors, and sizes, according to Nikki Baird, vice president of innovation at retail software provider Aptos. ''There is still so much up in the air, and the broader your assortment, the more risky it is that you get it wrong,'' she said. ''The easiest way to respond to inventory risk is to narrow the options so you can concentrate your risk to some degree.'' Everlane, which built its clothing brand around ethically sourced products, is focusing on classics like sweaters and jeans for the holidays. Even so, COVID-related complications are delaying orders by weeks, or sometimes months, according to chief product officer Erika Edelson. ''Ports are congested ... even causing boats to sometimes become stranded on the water,'' she said. ''Once our products are sold out, it may be weeks or months before we can restock.'' The time it takes to ship an item from Asia to the United States has roughly doubled - 15 days by air, 90 by sea - during the pandemic, Shah said. The backlog, coupled with labor shortages and pandemic-related shutdowns at every point in the process have led to monthslong waits for electronics, furniture and other imports. Such delays, analysts say, are likely to cascade in coming weeks. Freight volume at the Port of Los Angeles, the country's largest port, has increased for 12 straight months. ''This remarkable, sustained import surge is pushing the supply chain to new levels,'' said Gene Seroka, the port's executive director. Even once merchandise has made it to stores and warehouses, getting it to consumers' homes will be an ongoing challenge. Delivery carriers like UPS and FedEx are scrambling to hire thousands of truck drivers and package handlers. The US Postal Service has signaled plans to hire 40,000 seasonal workers and convert 33,00 non-career employees to career status to further scale-up capabilities. The holiday season produced recurring nightmares for the mail agency last year: The November election, in which nearly half the nation's voters cast their ballots by mail, combined with a workforce straining under COVID-era package volumes gummed up the Postal Service's entire network. Employee availability plummeted, and led to bins of packages choking walkways at sorting facilities. Food and temperature-sensitive items spoiled as they sat delayed; postal workers complained about flies swarming packages and the smell of rotting materials. Nine major sorting facilities turned away mail shipments during the height of the season, or attempted to divert it to other plants, according to an inspector general report. Scores of postal customers reported receiving holiday mail as late as April. This year, retailers are pulling together contingency plans, finding local and regional alternatives to national carriers and, in some cases, building up their own delivery capabilities. Target is tapping its own workers to drop off packages, and Walmart is creating a new last-mile service that will help other businesses get orders to customers' homes.",['ENGLISH'],1141,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-JOJCQ3UKZZA5PGULVKE5TZXNYA,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008X7D', 'className': 'MANUFACTURING FACILITIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DIJW', 'className': 'PRICES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009Y72', 'className': 'CHRISTMAS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000971E', 'className': 'PRICE INCREASES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'STX001925', 'className': 'BUSINESS OPERATIONS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DJQC', 'className': 'CONSUMERS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000DE1S', 'className': 'COMPUTING & ELECTRONICS SHORTAGES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ4OUNEQThGNzA3NDgxNzhBMDQxQ0M2OUU0NzgzMUI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Nzk2NTgyMDE4NDY2NDMzNEI0MTFGMjM0QzA2MzlBQTM', 'className': 'Discharge & Loading'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000CPAS', 'className': 'RETAIL SALES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000DQGE', 'className': 'COVID CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009FBC', 'className': 'PLASTICS MARKETS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'N483055GM', 'className': 'MARINE SHIPPING'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008X7D', 'className': 'MANUFACTURING FACILITIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001738', 'className': 'TOYS & GAMES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000971E', 'className': 'PRICE INCREASES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001912', 'className': 'RETAIL & WHOLESALE TRADE'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008XSL', 'className': 'RETAILERS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST000DQ2M', 'className': 'INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N339932MC', 'className': 'TOYS & GAMES MFG'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'N481112MM', 'className': 'AIR FREIGHT'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000DE1S', 'className': 'COMPUTING & ELECTRONICS SHORTAGES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000DF3W', 'className': 'DISTRIBUTION CENTERS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ4OUNEQThGNzA3NDgxNzhBMDQxQ0M2OUU0NzgzMUI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Nzk2NTgyMDE4NDY2NDMzNEI0MTFGMjM0QzA2MzlBQTM', 'className': 'Discharge & Loading'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000CPAS', 'className': 'RETAIL SALES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000376', 'className': 'CONSUMER ELECTRONICS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009FBC', 'className': 'PLASTICS MARKETS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001714', 'className': 'TEXTILE MFG'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N313000CC', 'className': 'TEXTILE MILLS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'N483055GM', 'className': 'MARINE SHIPPING'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'ST000CYG1', 'className': 'TEXTILES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST0009EUZ', 'className': 'PASSENGER & CARGO AIRCRAFT'}, {'score': '57', 'classCode': 'STX001332', 'className': 'PLASTICS'}], 'person': [{'score': '54', 'classCode': 'PE0009VUU', 'className': 'JEFFREY P BEZOS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJK', 'className': 'JOE BIDEN'}], 'country': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC385', 'className': 'VIET NAM'}]}"
25,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,"Afghans face hunger crisis, adding to Taliban's challenges",,,"Link to Image KABUL - The United Nations' stockpiles of food in Afghanistan could run out this month, a senior official warned Wednesday, threatening to add a hunger crisis to the challenges facing the country's new Taliban rulers as they endeavor to restore stability after decades of war. About one third of the country's population of 38 million doesn't know if they will have a meal every day, according to Ramiz Alakbarov, the UN's humanitarian chief in Afghanistan.","FULL TEXT The UN's World Food Program has brought in food and distributed it to tens of thousands of people in recent weeks, but with winter approaching and a drought ongoing, at least $200 million is needed urgently to be able to continue to feed the most vulnerable Afghans, he said. ""By the end of September, the stocks which the World Food Program has in the country will be out,"" he told reporters at a virtual news conference. ""We will not be able to provide those essential food items because we'll be out of stocks."" Earlier, UN officials said that of the $1.3 billion needed for overall aid efforts, only 39 percent has been received. The Taliban, who seized control of the country ahead of the withdrawal of American forces this week, now must govern a nation that relies heavily on international aid and is in the midst of a worsening economic crisis. In addition to the concerns about food supplies, civil servants haven't been paid in months and the local currency is losing value. Most of Afghanistan's foreign reserves are held abroad and currently frozen. Mohammad Sharif, a shopkeeper in the capital of Kabul, said that shops and markets there have supplies, but a major concern is rising food prices. ""If the situation continues like this and there is no government to control the prices, that will cause so many problems for local people,"" he said. In the wake of the US pullout, many Afghans are anxiously waiting to see how the Taliban will rule. When they were last in power, before being driven out by the US-led invasion in 2001, they imposed draconian restrictions, refusing to allow girls to go to school, largely confining women to their homes and banning television, music, and even photography. But more recently, their leaders have sought to project a more moderate image. Schools have reopened to boys and girls, though Taliban officials have said they will study separately. Women are out on the streets wearing Islamic headscarves - as they always have - rather than the all-encompassing burqa the Taliban required in the past. The challenges the Taliban face in reviving the economy could give Western nations leverage as they push the group to fulfill a pledge to form an inclusive government and guarantee women's rights. The Taliban say they want to have good relations with other countries, including the United States. Many Afghans fear the Taliban won't make good on those pledges and also are concerned that the nation's economic situation holds little opportunity. Tens of thousands sought to flee the country as a result in a harrowing airlift. But thousands who had worked with the US and its allies, as well as up to 200 Americans, remained in the country after the efforts ended with the last US troops flying out of Kabul international airport just before midnight Monday. President Biden later defended his handling of the chaotic withdrawal and evacuation efforts, which saw spasms of violence, including a suicide bombing last week that killed 13 American service members and 169 Afghans. He said it was inevitable that the final departure from two decades of war would be difficult. He said he remains committed to getting the Americans left behind out if they want. The Taliban have said they will allow people with legal documents to travel freely, but it remains to be seen whether any commercial airlines will be willing to offer service. Bilal Karimi, an official member in the Taliban spokesman's office, said Wednesday that a team of Turkish and Qatari technicians arrived in Kabul to help get the airport up and running again. Alakbarov, the UN humanitarian official, said that the United Nations is asking for access to the airport so it can deliver food and other supplies directly to the capital. The Taliban also have to contend with the threat from the Islamic State group, which is far more radical and claimed responsibility for the bombing at the airport. The Taliban have pledged they won't allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for attacks on other countries - a key US demand since the militants once harbored the al-Qaida leaders who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks. In the wake of last week's bombing, American officials said drone strikes targeted the Islamic State group's affiliate in Afghanistan, and Biden vowed to keep up airstrikes. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday that it was ""possible"" that the US will have to coordinate with the Taliban on any counterterrorism strikes in Afghanistan in the future.",['ENGLISH'],876,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-KDZFWWU3UFFLPEVYMPIKDTMSYQ,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'ST000DKU4', 'className': 'UNITED NATIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00098XE', 'className': 'FOOD ASSISTANCE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9J', 'className': 'FOOD CHARITIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000CEFJ', 'className': 'FOOD CRISES & SHORTAGES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000CUXE', 'className': 'HUNGER IN SOCIETY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N928120KM', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000CURU', 'className': 'TALIBAN'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00097CV', 'className': 'UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D1DR', 'className': 'NEGATIVE NEWS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DIJW', 'className': 'PRICES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000A51F', 'className': 'ECONOMIC CRISIS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000D89F', 'className': ""FEMINISM & WOMEN'S RIGHTS""}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097WX', 'className': 'FOOD PRICES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001851', 'className': 'WOMEN'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000971D', 'className': 'POPULATION SIZE'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001463', 'className': 'RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST00099LR', 'className': 'MUSLIMS & ISLAM'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST00096SZ', 'className': 'PRESS CONFERENCES'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'ST000DN7Q', 'className': 'ANTI-MUSLIM REGULATION & POLICY'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'STX000303', 'className': 'CIVIL SERVICES'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'STX000798', 'className': 'GOLD & FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'ST000D1FR', 'className': 'NEGATIVE ECONOMIC NEWS'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST000971E', 'className': 'PRICE INCREASES'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001464', 'className': 'RELIGION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000CEFJ', 'className': 'FOOD CRISES & SHORTAGES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001902', 'className': 'FOOD & BEVERAGE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097WX', 'className': 'FOOD PRICES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009MJM', 'className': 'FOOD PRODUCTS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009SWJ'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DR32', 'className': 'OUTERWEAR'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'STX000798', 'className': 'GOLD & FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST0008XSL', 'className': 'RETAILERS'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST000971E', 'className': 'PRICE INCREASES'}], 'city': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GX001', 'className': 'KABUL, AFGHANISTAN'}], 'country': [{'score': '97', 'classCode': 'GC508', 'className': 'AFGHANISTAN'}, {'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

Ellement,Link to Image The powerful weather system bringing torrential rainfall to Massachusetts late Wednesday and Thursday could create flooding issues for residents and communities along rivers and streams and emergency officials were offering issuing safety recommendations.,"FULL TEXT ""Flooding is the most common hazard in Massachusetts. Some floods develop slowly, while flash floods can occur within minutes or hours after a storm or containment system break,"" according to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. - The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has an on-line tool that let people check their address and see if the location is in a flood zone. It's called the FEMA Flood Map Service Center and its available here. - Flood water can rise very quickly and it does not have to become very deep for it to pose a threat. According to the National Weather Service, a flood that is just six inches of fast moving water can knock over an adult and drag them downstream. So? Don't go wading in flood water and especially not in an area where a flash flood is active, the weather service warns. - Prepare your home. Move precious items to higher floors, charge up electronics. and if you have a sump pump, test it now and make sure that essential tool is fully operational before the rains come. ""Make a record of your personal property by taking photos or videos of your belongings. Store these records in a safe place,'' MEMA suggests. - A lot of data has been developed by government agencies about flooding concerns. But the best early warning system is probably among people who live in low lying areas near streams and rivers and other fresh water bodies in the state - they already know if they are at risk based on past experience. ""For this particular storm... this is not a coastal storm this is not a storm surge flooding,"" said Christopher Besse, spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. ""This is really a rain event...Over the years, people may know those areas prone to flooding."" He added: ""The real message is making sure people as best they can, understand the risk given where they live. If people do live near an area near a river, keep an eye on that. If the river starts approaching and getting closer than it - it's time to leave."" - Heed emergency warnings by officials. Coincidentally, Gov.

The plan follows an earlier announcement by the Baker administration that vaccines would be required for workers at skilled nursing facilities. The requirement would apply to 62 freestanding rest homes, 268 assisted living residences, 85 programs and up to 100,000 home care workers, the statement said. Workers will be required to get vaccinated ""unless they qualify for a limited exemption because they have a medical condition that prevents them from receiving vaccination or they object to vaccination based on a sincerely held religious belief,"" the statement said. For rest homes, assisted living residents, and hospice settings, the requirement applies to all those directly employed and contractors who regularly enter the facility. The requirement for home care workers applies to all individuals providing in-home, direct care who are employed by an agency that is contracted or subcontracted with the state, the statement said. It also applies to independent, non-agency-based care workers contracted with the state. The plan is subject to approval by the Public Health Council, a panel that advises the state Department of Public Health and promulgates regulations, the statement noted. Massachusetts assisted living executives urged the Baker administration earlier this month to mandate vaccines for their industry. They said thousands of frail elders in assisted living residences, most of them vaccinated but with weak immune systems, are still vulnerable to infections because many workers in the facilities have yet to get their shots, the Globe reported.

29,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,"After Ida, small recovery signs amid daunting destruction",,,"Link to Image NEW ORLEANS - Lights came back on for a fortunate few, some corner stores opened their doors, and crews cleared fallen trees and debris from a growing number of roadways Wednesday - small signs of progress amid the monumental task of repairing the damage inflicted by Hurricane Ida. Still, suffering remained widespread three days after Ida battered Louisiana and parts of Mississippi as the fifth-most-powerful hurricane to strike the United States. Some low-lying communities remained largely underwater. Roughly a million homes and businesses still had no electricity, and health officials said more than 600,000 lacked running water.","FULL TEXT The death toll rose to at least six after a coroner confirmed a 65-year-old woman had drowned in her Louisiana home and police in Maryland said a 19-year-old man was found dead in an apartment complex flooded by heavy rain from Ida's remnants. And the staggering scope of the disaster began to come into focus, with a private firm estimating total damage from Ida could exceed $50 billion. With all of New Orleans blacked out except for those running generators, Byron Lambert woke up startled at about 1:30 a.m. when light suddenly came on down the hall from where he slept. He first thought it was a burglar, then realized his home had electricity. Lambert's house in eastern New Orleans was among more than 11,000 homes and businesses that had power restored early Wednesday, according to the electric company Entergy. ""When it came on it startled me. I'm like 'All right! We got power,'"" Lambert said, his enthusiasm tempered by the knowledge of what others were going through. ""I'm fortunate, but they have a lot of people that aren't as fortunate as me, and I pray for them because it's rough."" There were still 989,000 homes and businesses without power, or 44 percent of all state utility customers in southeast Louisiana, from the New Orleans area to Baton Rouge, according to the state Public Service Commission. Phillip May, president and chief executive of Entergy Louisiana, told reporters Wednesday he predicts ""a lot more progress"" in coming days. Still, he said full recovery will be slow, with thousands of power poles and transformers knocked out by the storm. In neighboring Mississippi, 32,000 customers had no electricity. Hard-hit areas in southeast Louisiana were under a heat advisory Wednesday, with forecasters warning combined heat and humidity could make some areas feel like 108 degrees Fahrenheit. Officials scrambled to offer food, water, and places to cool off. National Guard troops had handed out more than 141,000 meals, 143,000 liters of water, and more than 500 tarps in Louisiana as of Wednesday morning, according to Governor John Bel Edwards' office. In New Orleans, officials opened seven places where people could get a meal and sit in air conditioning. The city was also using 70 transit buses as cooling sites, Mayor LaToya Cantrell said. In New Orleans, some residents gathered at a basketball gym with large fans running to cool off and charge their phones. People took random boxes holding chicken salad or tuna salad, and a man outside offered granola bars, applesauce, and chips. More than 1,200 people were walking through some of Ida's hardest-hit communities to look for people needing help, according to the Louisiana Fire Marshal's office. In coastal Jefferson Parish, where Ida brought severe flooding, authorities were waiting for floodwaters to recede enough for trucks carrying food, water, and repair supplies to begin moving into Lafitte and other low-lying communities. ""We are pretty confident that those that wanted to get out have now been able to get out,"" said Captain Jason Rivarde of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, who said more than 100 people were rescued in the area. Search and rescue missions were tapering off but continued in four parishes that still had floodwaters, Brigadier General Lee W. Hopkins of the Louisiana National Guard said on a Zoom call. That's compared to 31 parishes in the hours immediately after the storm. President Biden was to visit Louisiana Friday to survey the damage, the White House said. In New Orleans, where the mayor estimated roughly half the population had evacuated, there were growing signs of recovery. Flags hung from dangling power lines to help drivers avoid them, and in one neighborhood, someone decorated the downed lines with strands of tinsel in an echo of Mardi Gras. City crews removing debris from roads and cutting up fallen trees had some streets almost completely cleared, while others remained cluttered with obstacles. A few corner stores were open, many taking cash only, though some had working ATM machines. In many areas, National Guard soldiers or law enforcement stood posted at pharmacies and gas stations, where drivers waited in long lines for fuel. Louisiana's transportation department announced that all interstate systems across the state had reopened and been cleared of debris. AT&T, which faced widespread cellphone outages after Ida, said it's currently operating at more than 90 percent of normal capacity. As a clearer picture of Ida's devastation emerged, the hurricane likely caused $50 billion to $60 billion in total damage, estimated Karen Clark, who has calculated catastrophic risk since 1987. Her risk modeling company, Karen Clark and Company, figured just $18 billion of those losses would be insured. Those estimates would rank Ida anywhere from the fifth- to seventh-costliest US hurricane based on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Katrina, Harvey, Maria, and Sandy were well over that amount. NOAA says 2017′s Irma incurred about $55 billion in damage and 1992′s Andrew about $53 billion in 2019 dollars.",['ENGLISH'],1003,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-P6UOU4X4AZBDVE5D4WAFGCNUKI,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Energy & Utilities Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000453', 'className': 'DEATH & DYING'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009F7U', 'className': 'HURRICANES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001826', 'className': 'WEATHER'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000D1DR', 'className': 'NEGATIVE NEWS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DEUI', 'className': 'SEVERE WEATHER'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000425', 'className': 'DEATH RATES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000735', 'className': 'FLOODS & FLOODING'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DOA4', 'className': 'WEATHER ALERTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'N922120QM', 'className': 'POLICE FORCES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000CYFW', 'className': 'HEAT STRESS DISORDERS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Energy & Utilities'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjI0NUI3NzREMEFFNDJBQzk4MzI3RTU5RTREQ0RDQkQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODlFNTdDNTQ4MUFCNEM1NUIwN0I1NUQ4NEUzMkJBMkY', 'className': 'Duties of Coroners & Medical Examiners'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST000DF9I', 'className': 'HEAT WAVES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'STX001359', 'className': 'POWER FAILURES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001900', 'className': 'ENERGY & UTILITIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjNBOTc1MjdCNkU5NENCRDg1OTk1QjQyRjNBNDMwOUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzMyRjFDNjRCQUVENEJBMkEzMjZEMUVBQzA2MUIwQ0I', 'className': 'Electricity Distribution & Transmission'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzMyRjFDNjRCQUVENEJBMkEzMjZEMUVBQzA2MUIwQ0I7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA', 'className': 'Electric Power Industry'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'N926130MJ', 'className': 'PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFENThDQTNGRUE4NDA3MkJGN0JGRjMxNUY3N0MxNTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjNBOTc1MjdCNkU5NENCRDg1OTk1QjQyRjNBNDMwOUU', 'className': 'Electricity Generation'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000775', 'className': 'NATURAL GAS & ELECTRIC UTILITIES'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUUzODAyRDk1QzVFNEZGMEJDM0RGMDYxOTlEMEEzRDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Energy & Utilities'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N220000CC', 'className': 'UTILITIES INDUSTRY'}], 'person': [{'score': '57', 'classCode': 'PE000DOG1', 'className': 'JOHN BEL EDWARDS'}], 'city': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GX608', 'className': 'NEW ORLEANS, LA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX564', 'className': 'BATON ROUGE, LA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'GS134', 'className': 'LOUISIANA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS136', 'className': 'MARYLAND, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
30,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",OPINION,,History has its eyes on Boston's mayoral race,"In a city long marked by white hegemony, it matters that the next elected mayor will be a person of color.",Renée Graham,"Link to Image Never before during my years in Boston have so many out-of-state friends asked me some variation of this question: ""So how's it looking up there?"" They want to know what's happening in Boston's mayoral campaign. On Sept. 14, acting Mayor Kim Janey, City Councilors Andrea Campbell, Annissa Essaibi George, and Michelle Wu, and John Barros, the city's former chief of economic development, will vie in the preliminary election. The top two finishers will face off in November, but whatever the results, this much is already known: For the first time in Boston's history, a person of color, most likely a woman, will be elected mayor.","FULL TEXT If not quite a racial reckoning, it's a critical moment for Boston. And even those who don't live here feel as if they, too, have a stake in the outcome. That's been apparent since March when former mayor Martin J. Walsh departed City Hall to become President Biden's labor secretary. As succession protocol dictates, Janey, then city council president, was sworn in and became Boston's first person of color and first woman mayor. Even before she was the last candidate to announce her mayoral campaign, Janey garnered national headlines with her appointment, hers a different face representing what many hoped would lead to a different Boston. Janey is one of nine Black women leading one of the nation's 100 largest cities, including Lori Lightfoot (Chicago); Keisha Lance Bottoms (Atlanta); Muriel Bowser (Washington, D.C.); London Breed (San Francisco); LaToya Cantrell (New Orleans); and Tishaura Jones (St. Louis). All of those cities have previously had Black mayors. Only twice have Black candidates even survived to a final mayoral election in Boston. Both Mel King, in 1983, and Tito Jackson, in 2017, lost to white men. Now Bostonians seek a leader who better reflects the city's shifting demographics. In their television ads, both Campbell and Janey speak frankly of their personal tribulations. Campbell talks about growing up in public housing in Roxbury and how her twin brother, Andre, died while incarcerated. Janey cites her experiences as a child of Boston's acrimonious school desegregation era who briefly lived in a shelter and became a mother when she was 16. Wu, Essaibi George, and Barros have all touted their histories as small-business owners connecting them to many who even before the pandemic toiled to survive rising rents and rampant gentrification. Voters who have felt disenfranchised due to racism or sexism not only see candidates who look like them, but have also had to navigate similar struggles in this city. Each has seasoned their campaigns with lived experiences viewed not as deficits but trials that have shaped them and serve as assets that make them empathetic to constituents. This neither looks nor feels like past mayoral contests. Of course, the next mayor already knows that if racial progress is halting in America, in Boston it can be glacial. Not until Ayanna Pressley, now a congresswoman, won in 2009 had a Black woman been elected to the city council. Though people of color are the majority, the city remains as segregated as any in the nation. And in the past decade, the city's Black population declined 3.3 percent, more than any other group. When it comes to race in this city, the dead past is never allowed to bury its dead. Boston is - and isn't - the same place I moved to decades ago despite warnings from friends that the city would offer a young Black woman nothing but tears and disappointment. Results of a single election can't atone for Boston's complicated history. It won't erase the indelible image of an angry white man trying to impale a Black man with an American flag. It won't silence the persistent echoes of racial epithets at Fenway Park, or wipe away memories of a white man throwing a water bottle at Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets as the former Celtics player walked off the Garden floor last May. Anyone who remembers Barack Obama's ""postracial"" election and the ferocious white backlash that birthed the Trump presidency eight years later should know better. Yet with history's eyes set on Boston, a cautious embrace of this unique moment is still an embrace. In the national spotlight, this race is not only a referendum on transforming City Hall. It can counter with action a reputation long characterized by racial animus and white hegemony. And if the first elected mayor of color in Boston, of all places, can lead this city toward equity and justice, perhaps America will follow.",['ENGLISH'],772,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-Q67KUKLCFBAKXPBNLPDIMQE3WI,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '97', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q', 'className': 'Mayors'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9I', 'className': 'CITY GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000297', 'className': 'CITIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001851', 'className': 'WOMEN'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001444', 'className': 'RACE & ETHNICITY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST00097CZ', 'className': 'ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DA0C', 'className': 'RACISM & XENOPHOBIA'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Local Governments'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009QS2', 'className': 'REPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST00098X6', 'className': 'SEX & GENDER ISSUES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DM8Y', 'className': 'BUSINESS NEWS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEM2MTQ4MDU4RjZCNDM1QzhGNkQxOUM1RUU5NTUyN0E7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjM5NEJCMDNFQkQ0NEM4NkEwOTQwOTkyRDRCRjZDNzA', 'className': 'Desegregation'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001581', 'className': 'SMALL BUSINESS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST00096VM', 'className': 'DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX000549', 'className': 'ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000DLOJ', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST000D1DR', 'className': 'NEGATIVE NEWS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001430', 'className': 'PUBLIC HOUSING'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST0009ZCS', 'className': 'TWINS & MULTIPLE BIRTHS'}, {'score': '59', 'classCode': 'STX000556', 'className': 'EDITORIALS & OPINIONS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000025', 'className': 'MARKETING & ADVERTISING'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST0009RDZ'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX000215', 'className': 'BROADCAST ADVERTISING'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJK', 'className': 'JOE BIDEN'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DR1B', 'className': 'MARTY WALSH'}], 'city': [{'score': '98', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS124', 'className': 'DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
31,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",HIGH SCHOOLS,,MIAA tournament management committee reaches a compromise on COVID-19 dilemma,,Jim Clark,"The MIAA's tournament management committee continues to clean up logistical issues and work through hurdles as the new statewide tournament officially rolls out with the start of the 2021-22 school year. Among the potential concerns is a major one athletic directors and administrators have faced for more than a year: What to do if a team is unable to play because of COVID-19. During Wednesday's first virtual meeting of the school year, the TMC grappled with the best way to handle games not being played because of COVID-19, particularly as it pertains to the new power rating system that will be used to select and seed tournaments in most MIAA sports.","FULL TEXT The TMC already had voted unanimously Wednesday that if one team forfeits a game, it will be entered into the power ratings at the maximum allowed scoring margin for a particular sport - 14-0 for football and rugby, 10-0 for basketball and lacrosse, 5-0 for baseball and softball, and 3-0 for soccer, volleyball, and ice or field hockey. ""If it's a legit COVID reason why [a team] can't play, I'm not sure that I love the power rating system coming into play there,"" said Westborough athletic director Johanna DiCarlo, who originally motioned to have any COVID game declared a no-contest. Wellesley AD John Brown countered that it wouldn't be fair to the team not affected by COVID to lose out on a power rating opportunity for a game that doesn't get played. ""I just think that to penalize somebody that is trying to play the game, or to penalize somebody that can't play the game, is just not right,"" Brown said. The TMC haggled with the math concept of the power ratings - whether a game could count for one team and not the other - before agreeing that any games canceled and not made up because of COVID would be declared no-contests. A school then can appeal if cancellations cause a team to fail to reach a qualifying standard such as a .500 record or a minimum number of games played in a season. ""That's probably the best compromise in regards to assuring [a team] makes the tournament,"" said TMC chair Jim O'Leary of St. John's Prep. · In approving formats for 2021 fall sports, the TMC accepted the football committee's modification that a team must schedule at least seven games over the eight-week regular season (not including Thanksgiving). Also, because football brackets will be capped at 16 teams for each division, the TMC approved the recommendation that a team must have at least three wins to qualify - eliminating the possibility of a school finishing in the top 16 with two wins or fewer. · For boys' golf, the TMC removed previous language that would have allowed for the top two teams (plus ties) in a league to qualify for a sectional tournament - making it consistent with all other MIAA sports. · The TMC unanimously voted to set a minimum qualifying standard of 50 percent of the maximum allowed games in a particular sport - i.e., if the maximum number of games allowed in a sport is 20, a team must schedule at least 10 to qualify. · Seeding tiebreaker language was modified, making the second step in the process (behind head-to-head results) the Average of Opponent Ratings - which is one half of the new power ratings formula. · New Bedford AD Tom Tarpey (District 8) was introduced as the only new member of the committee. DiCarlo was elected as vice chair, replacing Mary Ryan of Rockport, who remains a TMC member.",['ENGLISH'],595,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-QSCKRRTIWBGSFERRCBZZPNP7IA,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Business & Corporate Compliance', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST000DQGE', 'className': 'COVID CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DOTH', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPF', 'className': 'EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST00098PN', 'className': 'PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000108', 'className': 'APPROVALS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001066', 'className': 'MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001089', 'className': 'MATHEMATICS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009JZH', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000170', 'className': 'BASEBALL'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000710', 'className': 'FIELD HOCKEY'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0009RM9', 'className': 'SOFTBALL'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DHIF', 'className': 'VOLLEYBALL'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009XS5', 'className': 'THANKSGIVING'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000171', 'className': 'BASKETBALL'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000A0LE', 'className': 'LACROSSE'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001587', 'className': 'SOCCER'}], 'industry': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPF', 'className': 'EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'N610000CC', 'className': 'EDUCATIONAL SERVICES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST00098PN', 'className': 'PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009JZH', 'className': 'HIGH SCHOOLS'}]}"
32,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,White House details plans to improve housing affordability,,,"Link to Image WASHINGTON - White House officials are outlining plans to build and restore more than 2 million homes, a response to the volcanic rise in housing prices over the past year.","FULL TEXT Millions of Americans are getting priced out of ownership or stuck spending the bulk of their income on rent. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index climbed a record 19.1 percent in June from a year ago, as too few homes are available to buy and low interest rates have enabled affluent buyers and real estate investors to pay more for homes. The jump in prices is a threat to President Biden's vision of centering the US economy around the middle class, a group that has defined itself in large part through home ownership. Americans' desire to own homes has also altered regional politics as suburbanites aligned with Democrats in 2020 to help give Biden key victories in Arizona and Georgia, two states that have added population through new home construction. The White House Council of Economic Advisers on Wednesday posted on its blog a detailed analysis of the affordability problem and the administration's plans to relieve it. Its analysis notes that housing supply has fallen short of population growth for four decades, so many of the challenges predate the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers at the mortgage buyer Freddie Mac estimate that the United States is 3.8 million homes shy of what is needed to meet demand. The persistent shortage has meant that home prices are steadily increasing faster than incomes, making it harder for first-time buyers to save for down payments and keeping them in rentals longer. Nearly half of renters spend more than the recommended 30 percent of their incomes on housing. To increase home construction, Biden's economics team proposes a series of policy shifts. First, it intends to deliver 100,000 affordable housing units over three years through a series of administrative changes. It will increase mortgage availability through Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae for manufactured houses and buildings with two to four units. The government also intends to make it easier for would-be owners and nonprofits to buy homes that failed to sell in foreclosure auctions, as well as expand outreach to local governments and nonprofits to buy federally held homes. The government also plans to increase the financing options for apartment buildings through tax credits, loans, and grants. Secondly, the Biden administration estimates that its economic agenda would lead to the construction and renovation of 2 million homes. This would include the use of federal subsidies, the low-income housing tax credit, a new tax credit for construction in economically vulnerable neighborhoods, and incentives to remove exclusionary zoning and land use policies by local and state governments that limit new construction. Still, the blog post cautioned that a supply crunch could linger. ""There is no magic formula to quickly relieve the supply constraints,"" it concluded.",['ENGLISH'],531,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights

33,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,Moderna submits early data to FDA for third shot of COVID-19 vaccine,,,Link to Image (Bloomberg) -- Moderna said that it had filed initial data with the US Food and Drug Administration for clearance of a third-dose booster shot of its COVID-19 vaccine.,"FULL TEXT In a statement on Wednesday, the company said the booster shot, using a reduced dose of 50 micrograms that is half the dose used in the existing vaccine, raised antibody levels against the delta variant by more than 40-fold in a clinical trial. The company also said it planned to submit the data to regulators in Europe and elsewhere in the coming weeks. A panel of expert advisers to the FDA plans to hold a meeting on booster shots on Sept. 17, according to people familiar with the planning. The filing puts Moderna only slightly behind Pfizer and BioNTech in seeking official go-ahead for a third-dose booster. Those companies filed initial booster data with the FDA last month. A debate over booster shots is intensifying in the US amid a rise in breakthrough infections and a broader delta-variant fueled surge in illness. Still, moving too quickly toward booster shots is controversial among scientists, as there is little evidence that the capacity of vaccines to prevent serious illness, hospitalization and death has waned significantly. In clinical studies, a third shot given to people who participated in Moderna's original phase 3 trial more than six months after their first two shots boosted neutralizing antibodies significantly, according to results presented earlier this summer. There were no significant new side effects, the company said in an August earnings presentation. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are based on similar messenger RNA technology, and have produced similar overall results, but there are subtle differences. In particular, Moderna's current vaccine uses two 100 microgram doses, a higher amount than 30 microgram dose used in the Pfizer. While Pfizer has moved forward with the same dose for its booster shot, Moderna has been testing a lower dose 50 microgram for third dose booster, believing that it will not necessarily need to use a achieve a robust immune response. ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",['ENGLISH'],377,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-TDILTYM4HFHU5M2ENPXEVDQGBQ,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'STX001785', 'className': 'VACCINES'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX000311', 'className': 'CLINICAL TRIALS'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST000DOTH', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DQGE', 'className': 'COVID CORONAVIRUS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DQAS', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS VACCINE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000511', 'className': 'DISEASES & DISORDERS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008WZ7', 'className': 'DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000912', 'className': 'INFECTIOUS DISEASE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000702', 'className': 'US FDA REVIEW'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N541710QQ', 'className': 'MEDICAL RESEARCH'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0009FYC', 'className': 'IMMUNOLOGY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX000453', 'className': 'DEATH & DYING'}], 'industry': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'STX001785', 'className': 'VACCINES'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX000311', 'className': 'CLINICAL TRIALS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DQAS', 'className': 'COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS VACCINE'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0008WZ7', 'className': 'DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001323', 'className': 'PHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008X66', 'className': 'IMMUNOLOGIC FACTORS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001322', 'className': 'PHARMACEUTICALS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0009FYC', 'className': 'IMMUNOLOGY'}], 'country': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '56', 'classCode': 'GT115', 'className': 'EUROPE'}]}"

36,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",OPINION,,Are Marty Walsh and his mom on the same page in the Boston mayoral race?,"Annissa Essaibi George could be Walsh's not-so-secret favorite candidate. But her agenda is about tweaks, not shake-ups. And she does nothing to discourage speculation about Walsh's support.",Joan Vennochi,"Link to Image As Marty Walsh's mother goes, so goes Marty Walsh? At his farewell press conference, as he left the mayor's office to become US labor secretary, Walsh said he wouldn't endorse or play any role in the race to replace him. He made no such pledge about his mother, Mary, who still lives in the Dorchester home where she raised her family - and supports Boston city councilor and mayoral candidate Annissa Essaibi George, who grew up on the same street. Asked on WCVB's ""On the Record"" whether the former mayor backs her candidacy, Essaibi George said: ""I have not asked him directly for his vote. I hope he will consider me on September 14. . . . I would say I'm grateful to have the support of his mother."" To which co-host Janet Wu noted, ""She has a sign on her front lawn for you."" Of course, Walsh's mother has every right to make that political statement. But does it also say something about where her son stands? A spokeswoman for the Department of Labor said Walsh can't speak about the mayor's race ""in light of rules limiting political activities by federal employees"" and his focus on Biden administration priorities.","FULL TEXT The suggestion that Essaibi George is Walsh's not-so-secret favorite candidate isn't new. She made it the central joke of her St. Patrick's Day breakfast video, photoshopping him into old photos of herself. Her campaign manager, Cam Charbonnier, and communications director, Nicole Caravella, worked for Walsh, as did her political adviser, Tim Sullivan, now of the Liberty Square Group. With less than two weeks before the preliminary election, how does the Walsh factor play in a race billed as historic because no white man is in the running? Boston voters still like Walsh, at least according to a June poll in which he received a 72 percent job approval. Yet he also left behind serious problems in the police and school departments for Acting Mayor Kim Janey, the first Black person and first woman to hold that office, to handle. Meanwhile, minus the burden of executive decision-making, Essaibi George is working to assemble the coalition that twice elected Walsh, drawing support from West Roxbury, Hyde Park, South Boston, and Dorchester, along with backing from unions representing firefighters and EMS workers. William Gross, who was appointed by Walsh as the city's first Black police commissioner, also endorsed Essaibi George. Yet while Janey had to deal with fallout from Walsh's controversial appointment of Dennis White as Gross's successor - on Gross's recommendation - Essaibi George is unencumbered by it. On ""OTR,"" she said she has never asked Gross about White, who was fired by Janey because of domestic abuse allegations, which he denies. Essaibi George calls herself pragmatic, but she's often described as the status quo candidate. She wants to hire more police and keep admissions exams for Boston exam schools. During the ""OTR"" interview, she said she's ""nervous"" about vaccine passports and sounded equally nervous about a mask mandate. The delicate issue of race also influences the perception of her as something less than a change agent. Besides Janey, the other mayoral candidates are John Barros and Andrea Campbell, who are Black, and Michelle Wu, who is Asian American. Essaibi George's mother is PolishAmerican and her late father emigrated from Tunisia; she identifies as a woman of color. Yet she's viewed as the candidate of white Boston. (According to a recent poll, she and Wu drew the same support - 24 percent - from white voters.) The Essaibi George campaign said that, like Walsh, she's ""a constant presence"" in all Boston neighborhoods. It's also true that Walsh won his last campaign against Tito Jackson, who is Black, with crossover support from Black voters. In some ways, Essaibi George does represent change from the Walsh era. She's a mother, a former teacher, and a small-business owner. But her agenda is about tweaks, not shake-ups. And she does nothing to discourage speculation about Walsh's support.

""I think the kid came out and he did well - he did very well,"" Edelman said. ""You could see it in his eyes, you could see it in his reads that he felt comfortable in the pocket. He was looking at the right areas. Intensely watching these play calls and how he was handling them, he ran the no-huddle very well."" Edelman believes  the quarterback competition really was about Jones being able to prove himself to Bill Belichick, as opposed to a straight-up battle with Cam Newton. ""I don't think he quite beat [Newton] out,"" Edelman said, ""but the ceiling is so high, they spent a 15th overall pick on the kid, they're going to go with him."" Edelman also said he felt bad for Newton, who started 15 games for the Patriots last year and was released Tuesday following five weeks of training camp. Edelman  played only six games with Newton last year before a knee injury knocked him out for the season  (and his career), but in Week 2 against Seattle, Newton and Edelman connected eight times for 179 yards, Edelman's career high. Edelman believes that Belichick didn't want Newton's big personality getting in the way of Jones establishing himself as the team's leader.

""This agreement will protect students, staff, and faculty thereby enhancing the teaching, research, and service that are so beneficial to the entire state of Rhode Island."" URI, which has several other unions representing its workers, said it could not yet comment on the agreement with the faculty union. Classes at URI start Sept. 8. Public and private employers are now grappling with COVID-19 vaccine requirements as the Delta variant continues to complicate the pandemic picture in Rhode Island. One barrier is labor unions. While many union leaders say they broadly support COVID-19 vaccines, they also have sought protections for workers who do not wish to get vaccinated, and have also insisted that the rules be negotiated between labor and management. The result of a negotiation between URI and its faculty union was this, according to the union: All faculty must receive their final dose of COVID-19 vaccine by this coming Oct. 15. Also, members of the bargaining unit who are licensed health care providers have to follow Rhode Island Department of Health rules, which are slightly different. The deadline to request a medical or religious exemption is Oct. 1. And non-vaccinated faculty have to be tested in line with the university's testing protocols. ""The rapid intensification of COVID-19 spread in the past month has led us to request additional safety measures, and we're fortunate we could work with the University to provide this additional layer of protection."" Jay Walsh, the executive director of the URI chapter of the faculty union, said in an emailed statement. The public university is already requiring COVID-19 vaccines for undergraduate and graduate students, but is offering medical and religious exemptions for them too.

41,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,US faith groups unite to help Afghanistan refugees after war,,,"Link to Image America's major religions and denominations, often divided on other big issues, have united behind the effort to help receive an influx of refugees from Afghanistan following the end of the United States' longest war and one of the largest airlifts in history. Among those gearing up to help are Jewish refugee resettlement agencies and Islamic groups; conservative and liberal Protestant churches; and prominent Catholic relief organizations, providing everything from food and clothes to legal assistance and housing.","FULL TEXT ""It's incredible. It's an interfaith effort that involved Catholic, Lutheran, Muslim, Jews, Episcopalians, . . . Hindus, . . . as well as nonfaith communities who just believe that maybe it's not a matter of faith, but it's just a matter of who we are as a nation,"" said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and chief executive of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. The United States and its coalition partners have evacuated more than 100,000 people from Afghanistan since the airlift began Aug. 14, including more than 5,400 American citizens and many Afghans who helped the United States during the 20-year war. The effort by faith groups to help resettle them follows a long history of religious involvement in refugee policy, said Stephanie Nawyn, a sociologist at Michigan State University who focuses on refugee issues. Decades before the US Refugee Resettlement Program was created in 1980, faith organizations advocated for the resettlement of Jewish refugees during World War II. Religious groups also helped receive people who fled wars in Vietnam, the Balkans, and elsewhere. Besides helping distribute government resources, the groups mobilize private assets such as donations and volunteers and work with other private entities to provide supplies and housing, Nawyn said. US resettlement agencies were gutted under former president Donald Trump, who slashed refugee admissions yearly until they reached a record low. Now agencies are scrambling to expand capacity so they can handle the influx from Afghanistan. ""It's a historic effort, and there are and have been challenges - especially after rebounding from four years of what was a war on immigration, which decimated the refugee resettlement infrastructure,"" O'Mara Vignarajah said. ""Some of our local offices might have resettled 100 families throughout the entirety of last year, and they may now be looking at 100 families in the next few weeks,"" she said. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic Charities, and other agencies have been welcoming Afghan families at US military bases where they're being housed temporarily. A major challenge is finding affordable housing in areas where Afghans have typically resettled, including California and the Washington, D.C., region. ""I'm very concerned about children, getting them into schools,"" said Bill Canny, executive director of the USCCB's Migration and Refugee Services program. World Relief, a global Christian humanitarian organization, has helped resettle about 360 Afghans in the past month and is expecting many more, said Matthew Soerens, the group's US director of church mobilization. ""These are individuals in many cases who have put their lives at risk and their families' lives at risk for the people of the United States of America,"" he said. ""Now that they're facing the risk of retribution and retaliation from the Taliban, . . . I think most Americans of all religious traditions see it as a moral imperative for us to keep our promise."" Among the evacuees are Afghans who obtained special immigrant visas after working with the United States or NATO as interpreters or in some other capacity; people who have applied for the visas but not yet received them; and those who might have been particularly in danger under the Taliban. But thousands of others who also qualified for visas have been left behind because of a backlog of applications, and faith-based groups have called on President Biden's administration to get them safely to the United States. ""Some of the cases we are involved with have gotten out, but many have not,"" said Mark Hetfield, president and chief executive of the Jewish refugee agency HIAS, one of nine groups that contract with the State Department on resettlement. ""We have a girl who was literally shot by the Taliban and is now severely disabled who can't get out,"" he said. ""We are aware of many, many others who are trapped - and the US has left them behind."" Biden says he has tasked Secretary of State Antony Blinken to coordinate with international partners to hold the Taliban to their promise of safe passage for those who want to leave in the days ahead. The president has historically supported receiving refugees, cosponsoring legislation that created the government's program in 1980. This June, for World Refugee Day, Biden said that ""resettling refugees helps reunite families, enriches the fabric of America, and enhances our standing, influence, and security in the world."" Ardiane Ademi, director of the Refugee Resettlement Program for Catholic Charities in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, said it recently resettled several families who left Afghanistan before the airlift and is bracing for hundreds more. John Koehlinger, executive director of Kentucky Refugee Ministries, said his agency has received two families through the special immigrant visa program and has begun receiving additional evacuees. But other families the agency had been expecting have not yet arrived. ""Hopefully some or all of them are on a US military base being processed,"" he said. Ademi and Koehlinger said individuals and local congregations have volunteered to help with resettlement. Some have worked with refugees before, while others are newcomers motivated by the desperate news out of Afghanistan. ""It's a huge response,"" Ademi said. The humanitarian arm of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been providing personal hygiene items, underwear, sandals, and toys to refugees at an air base in Qatar, church spokesman Doug Anderson said. Widely known as the Mormon church, it has also been distributing supplies to the thousands of Afghans temporarily sheltered at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. And it is working with the US military to provide aid to the 10,000 refugees expected to arrive at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin, from where they will be relocated in communities across the country. Hala Halabi, national director of refugee facilitation for the Islamic Circle of North America Relief USA, said Muslim Americans have been flooding the group with calls, emails, and text messages offering to make donations, mentor refugees ,or prepare welcome boxes. The nonprofit recently furnished three apartments in the Dallas area with everything from the ""doormat to the food in the fridge,"" Halabi said, and is collecting supplies from pots and microwaves to pasta, sugar, and cleaning agents as it prepares for additional arrivals. Beyond the response from Muslim Americans, Halabi said she is heartened by how different faith groups have mobilized to help refugees: ""It's amazing from everybody.""",['ENGLISH'],1230,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-WZO2ZJXIYVC7LEJK2AOJHNY5DY,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Immigration Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUM5ODIzNEVDM0VCNDU1OTkyMDZCRUU1Q0ZCMzM4NDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0VDRDc0NDNBMjkwNDJBMEFCOUNGMTU1QzFBRTIyMTk', 'className': 'Refugee Status'}, {'score': '96', 'classCode': 'STX001464', 'className': 'RELIGION'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST00099LP', 'className': 'CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST000A0PN', 'className': 'PROTESTANTS & PROTESTANTISM'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000A7IS', 'className': 'ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00099LS', 'className': 'JEWS & JUDAISM'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DKU8', 'className': 'MIGRATION ISSUES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00099LR', 'className': 'MUSLIMS & ISLAM'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DHZS', 'className': 'RESETTLEMENT & REPATRIATION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000A0RH', 'className': 'CATHOLICS & CATHOLICISM'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000691', 'className': 'FAMILY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001463', 'className': 'RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000CYBP', 'className': 'CONSERVATISM'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DM88', 'className': 'ECUMENISM & INTERFAITH RELATIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009S6Y', 'className': 'HOUSING ASSISTANCE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N813311MM', 'className': 'HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000887', 'className': 'IMMIGRATION'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000309', 'className': 'CLERGY & RELIGIOUS VOCATIONS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000CYCH', 'className': 'LIBERALISM'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0009SCB', 'className': 'SOCIOLOGY'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009XVW', 'className': 'WORLD WAR II'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000278', 'className': 'CHARITIES'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000DOSH', 'className': 'HOUSING AFFORDABILITY'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'STX000290', 'className': 'CHILDREN'}], 'industry': [{'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000DOSH', 'className': 'HOUSING AFFORDABILITY'}], 'person': [{'score': '52', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS124', 'className': 'DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS138', 'className': 'MICHIGAN, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'GC508', 'className': 'AFGHANISTAN'}, {'score': '96', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'GC385', 'className': 'VIET NAM'}]}"
42,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,Judge conditionally approves Purdue Pharma opioid settlement,,,"Link to Image A federal bankruptcy judge on Wednesday gave conditional approval to a sweeping, potentially $10 billion plan submitted by OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma to settle a mountain of lawsuits over its role in the opioid crisis that has killed a half-million Americans over the past two decades. Under the settlement reached with creditors including individual victims and thousands of state and local governments, the Sackler family will give up ownership of the company and contribute $4.5 billion but will be freed from any future lawsuits over opioids.","FULL TEXT The drugmaker will be reorganized into a new company with a board appointed by public officials and will funnel its profits into government-led efforts to prevent and treat opioid addiction. Also, the settlement sets up a compensation fund that will pay some victims of drug addiction an expected $3,500 to $48,000 each. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain said Wednesday after speaking from the bench for more than six hours that he would approve the plan as long as two technical changes were made. If so, he said, he will formally enter the decision on Thursday. He said before his ruling that while he does not have ""fondness for the Sacklers or sympathy for them,"" collecting money from them through litigation would be complicated. The settlement comes nearly two years after the Stamford, Connecticut-based company filed for bankruptcy under the weight of some 3,000 lawsuits from states, local governments, Native American tribes, hospitals, unions and other entities. They accuse Purdue Pharma of fueling the crisis by aggressively pushing sales of its best-selling prescription painkiller. The Sacklers were not given immunity from criminal charges, though there have been no indications they will face any. State and local governments came to support the plan overwhelmingly, though many did so grudgingly, as did groups representing those harmed by prescription opioids. Nine states, Washington, D.C., Seattle and the U.S. bankruptcy trustee, which seeks to protect the nation's bankruptcy system, opposed the settlement, largely because of the protections granted to the Sackler family. At least some of them are expected to appeal. Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson quickly announced he would appeal the plan, calling it inadequate. The bankruptcy judge, based in White Plains, New York, had urged the holdouts to negotiate an agreement, warning that drawn-out litigation would delay getting settlement money to victims and the programs needed to address the epidemic. ""Bitterness over the outcome of this case is completely understandable,"" Drain said. ""But one also has to look at the process and the issues and risks and rewards and alternatives of continued litigation versus the settlement laid out in the plan."" He noted that the payout issue was mediated by Kenneth Feinberg, who oversaw the government's Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund. Most states have sued Purdue, claiming it aggressively marketed OxyContin, contributing to an opioid overdose and addiction epidemic that has been linked to more than 500,000 deaths in the U.S. Some of the deaths have been attributed to OxyContin and other prescription opioids, but most are from illicit forms of opioids such as heroin and illegally produced fentanyl. Opioid-linked deaths in the U.S. continued at a record pace last year, hitting 70,000. The crisis crushed the reputation of the Sackler family, major philanthropists whose name was once emblazoned on the walls of museums and universities around the world. With the settlement, family members who have owned the company will still be worth billions. Whether the deal provides enough accountability for the Sacklers was the most contentious question through the proceedings. Many state attorneys general and advocacy groups working on behalf of opioid victims pushed for the family members to pay more and initially fought against the liability waiver. They succeeded in boosting the amount the Sacklers would pay from a likely $3 billion to a guaranteed $4.5 billion over a decade. David Sackler, a former Purdue board member, had testified that family members would not accept the agreement unless it protected them from lawsuits. Otherwise, he said, the family would defend itself in litigation that could drag on for years, with the company's and the family's assets eaten up by lawyers' fees rather than used to help address the crisis. His father, Richard Sackler, a former Purdue president and board chairman, said under questioning that he, his family and the company did not bear responsibility for the opioid crisis. Drain noted that none of the four Sacklers who testified offered an explicit apology. ""A forced apology is not really an apology, so we will have to live without one,"" he said. One projection commissioned by a group of state attorneys general found that the family's wealth could rise from the current estimate of $10.7 billion to more than $14 billion by 2030 despite making payments under the settlement. That's because the family could continue to benefit from investment returns and interest payments as they make their gradual contributions under the deal. However, lawyers for Purdue and branches of the Sackler family disputed the assumptions used in the projection. The settlement also requires members of the Sackler family, who are scattered across the U.S., Britain and elsewhere in Europe, to get out of the opioid business worldwide. Several attorneys general won another provision that will create a massive public repository of company documents, including communications with lawyers that normally would be protected by attorney-client privilege. Purdue has said the settlement overall will be worth about $10 billion, a figure that includes the value of addiction treatment and overdose antidote drugs it is developing. The bankruptcy case is not the first time Purdue had faced legal trouble over the marketing of its prescription painkillers. The company pleaded guilty in 2007 to federal charges it misled regulators and others about the addiction dangers of OxyContin and agreed to pay more than $600 million in penalties. Last November, as part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, Purdue pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States and violating anti-kickback laws. Purdue's bankruptcy has been the highest-profile case in a complicated universe of opioid litigation. Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and the three largest U.S. drug distribution companies recently announced a settlement that could be worth up to $26 billion if state and local governments agree. Individual trials also remain, including one scheduled to start in October in Cleveland over the role pharmacies played in the crisis. Other trials have been held this year in California, New York and West Virginia, though verdicts have not yet been reached.",['ENGLISH'],1195,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights

43,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",WORLD,,Pope inadvertently quotes Putin to chide West's Afghan war,,,"MADRID - Pope Francis has criticized the West's two-decade-long involvement in Afghanistan as an outsider's attempt to impose democracy - although he did it by citing Russian President Vladimir Putin while thinking he was quoting German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Asked during a radio interview aired Wednesday about the new political map taking shape in Afghanistan after the United States and its allies withdrew from the Taliban-controlled country following 20 years of war, the pope said he would answer with a quote that he attributed to Merkel, whom he described as ""one of the world's greatest political figures.""","FULL TEXT ""It is necessary to put an end to the irresponsible policy of intervening from outside and building democracy in other countries, ignoring the traditions of the peoples,"" the pope said, using his own translation into Spanish. But the words were spoken last month by Putin in the presence of Merkel, during her visit to Moscow. During the meeting on Aug. 20, Putin scathingly criticized the West over Afghanistan, saying that the Taliban's rapid sweep over the country has shown the futility of Western attempts to enforce its own vision of democracy. At a news conference with Putin, Merkel conceded that the operation had failed in delivering a clear future for Afghans. ""We did not want to force any system on Afghanistan,"" Merkel told reporters. ""But we saw that millions of girls were glad to go to school and that women could participate. There are many in Afghanistan who are very, very unhappy about developments now."" Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, refused to comment directly on the pope's comments when asked on Wednesday, but he added that Merkel's position on Afghanistan was well known and repeated during a recent speech to the German parliament. The goal of no international terror attacks from Afghanistan since the military operation started in 2001 ""was achieved,"" Merkel told German lawmakers on Aug. 25: ""That was a concrete contribution to the safety of our country."" Although she acknowledged that the West's goals may have been too ambitious and cultural differences and corruption may have been underestimated, she also said that the mission in Afghanistan ""wasn't futile"" for the country's population, as it helped reduce child mortality, deliver drinking water and electricity to a majority of Afghans, and protected rule of law and the basic rights of women and others. Merkel said the analysis of what went wrong would take time and each international mission would need to be assessed on its own, but she added that ""we must not and won't forget Afghanistan, because even if it doesn't look like it in this bitter hour I'm convinced that no violence and no ideology will stop people's urge toward freedom, justice, and peace forever."" The Vatican didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the pope's interview with Spain's Cadena COPE, which took place Friday at his residence. The radio station owned by Spain's Catholic bishops' conference aired the talk on Wednesday and said that its content had been vetted by the pope himself. Francis also said that ""not all eventualities were taken into account"" in the departure of Western allies from Afghanistan. ""I don't know whether there will be a review or not [about what happened during the withdrawal], but certainly there was a lot of deception perhaps on the part of the new [Afghan] authorities,"" said the pope. ""I say deceit or a lot of naivety."" He said he believed that the Vatican's top diplomat was offering to engage in Afghanistan to make sure that locals don't suffer and called for Christians across the world to engage in ""prayer, penance, and fasting"" in the face of events in Afghanistan. In the interview, Francis addressed direct questions about his health for the first time since he underwent bowel surgery in early July. He said his body is adjusting well to the removal of part of his colon and that he can now eat whatever he wants and leads ""a totally normal life."" He said that he expected his trip to Slovakia and Hungary between Sept. 12-15 would be as busy as previous ones. He also has an upcoming tour taking him to Cyprus, Greece and Malta. The pope also said he was expecting to appear and speak at the U.N.-sponsored COP26 climate talks in November in Glasgow, Scotland.",['ENGLISH'],762,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-X7CNIVOLWBDEDHEII37WQHKBDE,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DIFM', 'className': 'CATHOLIC POPES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00099LP', 'className': 'CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DL87', 'className': 'DEMOCRACIES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000CURU', 'className': 'TALIBAN'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DL5Q', 'className': 'TYPES OF GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D1DR', 'className': 'NEGATIVE NEWS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST000971D', 'className': 'POPULATION SIZE'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000D89F', 'className': ""FEMINISM & WOMEN'S RIGHTS""}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTYzQjQyOTBDNzNDNEI2QUIyOTE2MEYyMTdBQTlDMzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZCMUU5OEUyREYzNDM4MjkzMkFCQzA0MTM3QUY1NjQ', 'className': 'Human Rights'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DFNA', 'className': 'RULE OF LAW'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX001851', 'className': 'WOMEN'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DHPL', 'className': 'GERMAN CHANCELLORS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000D2P9', 'className': 'GERMAN PARLIAMENT'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N921110CC', 'className': 'HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDlBOEIwQjg0OTdFNEFDQUJCRkZBMEZCNTJDMTlEQTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg4MDhDQ0I2QkY5NDU2Rjg1RDNEREFBODk1Nzg1QTY', 'className': 'Terroristic Acts'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000DRDX', 'className': 'NEGATIVE MISC NEWS'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'ST00096SZ', 'className': 'PRESS CONFERENCES'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST000DKUI', 'className': 'WATER RESOURCES'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg4MDhDQ0I2QkY5NDU2Rjg1RDNEREFBODk1Nzg1QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Terrorism'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX000425', 'className': 'DEATH RATES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001900', 'className': 'ENERGY & UTILITIES'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009UHD', 'className': 'ANGELA MERKEL'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009U46', 'className': 'VLADIMIR PUTIN'}, {'score': '58', 'classCode': 'PE000DAZW', 'className': 'POPE FRANCIS I'}], 'city': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'GX266', 'className': 'MOSCOW, RUSSIAN FEDERATION'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC508', 'className': 'AFGHANISTAN'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GC318', 'className': 'GERMANY'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'GC578', 'className': 'RUSSIAN FEDERATION'}]}"

Hogeland said that even if the board had the authority to fire Officer Craig Eichhammer, a 31-year veteran of the department, the termination might not hold because other town officials do not see strong enough grounds for firing, The Berkshire Eagle reported. Civil rights groups have called for Eichhammer's termination. While the panel cannot fire Eichhammer, it said it found the photo highly offensive and the demands to fire the officer are valid. Last month, groups like the Berkshire County branch of the NAACP and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law both condemned the officer's actions and called for his termination, the newspaper said. The groups said the officer's decision to pin a photo of Hitler in the town's police station mimicked actions by hate groups and spread antisemitic rhetoric and views. Eichhammer has said he hung the photo to make fun of a fellow officer who resembled Hitler. The board's power is limited in these circumstances, Hogeland said. In the past, the board has only had the authority to fire town managers and police chiefs ""We understand, and agree, that an officer having a photo of Hitler in a police locker is unacceptable and is highly offensive to the community,"" Hogeland said. ""(The officer's explanation) does not excuse his actions in posting the photo or keeping it in his locker. We condemn it.""",['ENGLISH'],300,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-XJY5G5KFNFEYFJOZY66NVK27QA,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N922120QM', 'className': 'POLICE FORCES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'STX000297', 'className': 'CITIES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0008X9I', 'className': 'CITY GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'N813311MM', 'className': 'HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Local Governments'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000302', 'className': 'CIVIL RIGHTS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DN9X', 'className': 'HATE SPEECH'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DHV1', 'className': 'ANTISEMITISM'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000512', 'className': 'DISMISSALS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DA0C', 'className': 'RACISM & XENOPHOBIA'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'Civil Rights Law'}], 'state': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}]}"

Simona Halep and Garbiñe Muguruza also reached the third round, ending long stretches without success in Flushing Meadows for the two-time Grand Slam champions. They were among the few players to squeeze in victories early on a rainy afternoon, when play started late and then was suspended briefly on the outer courts.","FULL TEXT Osaka had been scheduled to face Olga Danilovic of Serbia in the first match of the day at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Instead, the US Tennis Association moved the 12th-seeded Halep's match against Kristina Kucova into that spot. Halep won, 6-3, 6-1, to reach the third round for the first time since a quarterfinal appearance in 2016. She was knocked out in the first round in both 2017 and 2018 - the latter the first time the No. 1 seed lost in the first round of the US Open. But the No. 12 seed has made a strong return after missing the French Open and Wimbledon with a calf injury. ""Already it's a better result than when I was healthy, so it's a good thing to be in the third round here,"" she joked. The ninth-seeded Muguruza got past the second round of the US Open for the first time since 2017 when she beat Andrea Petkovic, 6-4, 6-2. She will play three-time US Open runner-up Victoria Azarenka. The No. 18 seed beat Jasmine Paolini, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1). ""I think it's going to be a very difficult match. I think she always plays great here,"" Muguruza said. ""I think that's the best. Just to go out there and play with people that are top level."" Halep and Muguruza - who have won the French Open and Wimblebon - played two of the only matches to start on time on a day when heavy rain was expected in the New York area. Puddles filled the grounds around the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, though rain had stopped as fans began to enter for the day session. The outside courts were empty while they were being dried so play could eventually start. Once they did, fifth-seeded Elina Svitolina beat Rebeka Masarova, 6-2, 7-5, and No. 20-seeded Ons Jabeur raced to a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Maria Camila Osorio Serrano in 53 minutes. Most other players on the outer courts had to wait out another delay during their matches, as fans raced for cover when rain returned. Osaka would have been going for her 17th straight victory in a Grand Slam match. After missing Wimbledon during a mental health break, she returned to the majors with a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Marie Bouzkova on Monday night. The two-time US Open champion hasn't lost a Grand Slam match since Coco Gauff beat her at the 2020 Australian Open. Danilovic wrote on Instagram that she was dealing with a viral illness unrelated to COVID-19. The 17-year-old Gauff was set for one of the featured matches of the day, facing 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens under the lights at Ashe. No. 5 seed Andrey Rublev eliminated Pedro Martinez in four sets but 15th-seeded Grigor Dimitrov, a semifinalist in the 2019 US Open, retired after losing two tiebreakers and trailing, 4-0, in the third against Alexei Popyrin.",['ENGLISH'],552,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-YCHFU44T5BDC3K2PIYBLYZOPB4,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009IRB', 'className': 'SPORTS AWARDS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001707', 'className': 'TENNIS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000A0KP', 'className': 'TENNIS TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DNWN', 'className': 'TENNIS FACILITIES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'N813990GM', 'className': 'SPORTS GOVERNING BODIES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST0009SE3', 'className': 'STADIUMS & ARENAS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001826', 'className': 'WEATHER'}], 'person': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'PE000DRH6', 'className': 'NAOMI OSAKA'}, {'score': '92', 'classCode': 'PE000DRH2', 'className': 'SIMONA HALEP'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DRH3', 'className': 'ELINA SVITOLINA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DRLR', 'className': 'GARBINE MUGURUZA'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST0009QYK', 'className': 'SERBIA'}]}"

50,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",POLITICS,,Gig workers question clears first hurdle before 2022 ballot,Attorney General Maura Healey approves 17 ballot petitions,Emma Platoff,"Link to Image A controversial ballot question that could reshape the gig economy moved one step closer to appearing before Massachusetts voters on the 2022 ballot. On Wednesday, Attorney General Maura Healey certified 17 ballot petitions as meeting constitutional muster, including questions on voter identification, happy hour, the legal status of app-based drivers, and more. That's just the first hurdle of many: Proponents of each question still have to gather more than 80,000 signatures over the next few months, and, if the Legislature doesn't take action on the petitions, more than 13,000 additional signatures in the spring. It's a taxing, expensive process; many initiatives don't make the ballot after missing one or more requirement. And there's always the possibility that a lawsuit could keep a petition from reaching voters, especially for controversial measures like the gig workers question.","FULL TEXT Thirteen initiatives were nixed in Healey's review, she announced, including several that had the backing of the Massachusetts Republican Party. One seeking ""to preserve the lives of children born alive,"" was rejected because, the agency said, ""its provisions are so ambiguous that it is impossible to determine, or inform potential voters of, the proposed law's meaning."" Healey's office also rejected one the party claimed targeted ""critical race theory,"" in part because ""it is inconsistent with the right to free speech."" Ballot petitions are reviewed under strict constitutional standards, the office said in a news release. They cannot infringe on protected constitutional rights and cannot pertain to subjects like religion or the power of the courts. Perhaps the most closely watched is the question on the legal classification of gig workers in Massachusetts. A coalition backed by tech companies such as Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Instacart seeks to keep classifying their drivers and deliverers as independent contractors, not employees, while offering them some new benefits. An opposing group, with support from large labor organizations, says those benefits are paltry compared with what drivers should already be getting under state law. The tech-backed coalition cheered Healey's decision Wednesday, providing reporters with statements from app-based workers who said they support the ballot question. ""We believe that Massachusetts voters will support what drivers are asking for: to remain independent contractors, in control of our own schedules, while gaining new benefits,"" said Brittney Woods of Boston, who drives with DoorDash. ""That flexibility and control is why we drive."" The labor-backed coalition opposing the ballot question, which earlier put out a legal memorandum asking Healey not to greenlight it, will ""carefully consider our litigation options,"" said coalition director Mike Firestone. ""The Uber/Big Tech ballot measure cheats workers, shields these massive companies from liability to customers, and makes Massachusetts taxpayers pick up the tab,"" Firestone said. Firestone previously served as Healey's chief of staff and her campaign manager. The measure has already spurred two formal complaints to state campaign finance authorities, with critics pointing the finger at proponents and proponents pointing right back again. That early mudslinging foreshadows what could well prove to be the ugliest, priciest ballot initiative fight in Massachusetts history, a battle with fronts in the courts and on the airwaves. In August, the labor-backed Coalition to Protect Workers' Rights - which opposes the ballot question - accused the tech-backed Coalition for Independent Work of raising and spending money without properly disclosing it. Days later, the tech-backed group fired back, asking state campaign finance authorities to investigate their rivals for improper disclosures of fund-raising and spending. Both coalitions have dismissed their rival's accusations as meritless. A spokesman for the state's Office of Campaign and Political Finance, Jason Tait, said the office does not confirm the existence of such complaints but does review each one that is submitted to the office. It's a fight that may sound familiar to California's Proposition 22, a similar measure that voters approved last year after tech companies spent $200 million successfully pushing it. A California court recently struck down Prop 22 as unconstitutional under that state's laws, a ruling that will be appealed and that does not have direct legal bearing on Massachusetts' version. Healey's staff decided that the ballot question passed legal muster even as their colleagues in another division of the attorney general's office actively sue Uber and Lyft, claiming they are violating state law by misclassifying drivers as independent contractors. Healey has said the two are entirely separate and her personal views do not inform the process of vetting ballot questions. The attorney general's office approved two versions of the gig workers ballot question. They are identical but for a provision included in only one version that would require drivers to undergo paid safety training sessions on topics like collision avoidance and sexual assault prevention. Proponents are moving ahead with both versions of the question, a spokesman said. Already expected to be on next fall's ballot: a constitutional amendment that would impose a 4 percent surtax on annual personal income above $1 million. That measure cleared its last procedural hurdle before the 2022 ballot in June, when overwhelming majorities in the Democratic-dominated Legislature backed it. Voters may also get the chance to opine on issues ranging from voter identification requirements to happy hours. Massachusetts banned happy hours in the 1980s after a series of drunk driving tragedies. Despite some movement at the Legislature, and widespread public support for bringing it back, Governor Charlie Baker has said he would ""be hard pressed to support changing it."" The ballot question seeks to permit happy hour drink specials. Another would require voters to present a government-issued photo ID before casting a ballot. Massachusetts does not ask voters to present identification at the polls, with some exceptions, such as for first-time voters. Voting rights advocates say that ID requirements are discriminatory against people of color and low-income voters, and are not intended to solve a legitimate public policy problem. A spokeswoman for the Secretary of State's Office said she is not aware of any recent voter fraud cases in Massachusetts. Healey declined to certify a petition seeking to ban teachers from presenting US history ""with the specific intent of making any such students feel personally responsible, at fault or liable, either individually or as a member of a racial or ethnic group, for the actions or omissions of others."" The Massachusetts GOP had claimed that that initiative would target ""critical race theory,"" though the phrase did not appear in the text itself. Critical race theory is an academic doctrine built on the idea that modern law and other institutions were shaped by historical patterns of racism that continue to disadvantage people of color and Black people in particular. Critics on the right have attempted to paint the theory with a broad brush, claiming it accuses all white Americans of racism and attempts to make students feel guilty for historical events they played no role in. A number of red states have passed laws banning ""critical race theory,"" limiting how educators can talk about the country's troubled racial history. In rejecting the initiative, agency staff wrote, ""read literally, a teacher could violate this proposed law based on their students' feelings in receiving instruction, and as a result, teachers' speech about 'our country's history' is chilled by this proposed law."" The state Republican party also slammed Healey for refusing to certify the ""born alive"" abortion-related petition, suggesting Healey's personal politics - she is a strong supporter of abortion rights - had come into play. The attorney general's office said it rejected the petition because it was ""ambiguous,"" an explanation the party scoffed at. ""Today's denial by AG Healey confirms the radical left has no problem eliminating medical care for babies born alive,"" GOP Chairman Jim Lyons said in a statement. ""The attorney general's failure to put her political views aside constitutes a dereliction of her duty.""",['ENGLISH'],1443,Copyright 2021 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-ZAC3SKN2RJBDPJSS2R2CF6RLEI,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '01', 'month': '09', 'year': '2021'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000128', 'className': 'ATTORNEYS GENERAL'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000160', 'className': 'BALLOTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DN59', 'className': 'GIG ECONOMY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001317', 'className': 'PETITIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001706', 'className': 'TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001812', 'className': 'VOTERS & VOTING'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'Constitutional Law'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000A2YF', 'className': 'FREELANCE EMPLOYMENT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST00097Z1', 'className': 'SELF EMPLOYMENT'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg', 'className': 'Freedom of Speech'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0Y2REExMDg3NTBBNDJDNDk0MzcwNDc1RTNEMUIyQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0M3QUYzNjlBN0UzNEVBMDk4OEIyMzdBMDlGQzA2RjI', 'className': 'Initiative & Referendum'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST0009TD5', 'className': 'US REPUBLICAN PARTY'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000A7IS', 'className': 'ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000DM8B', 'className': 'EMPLOYMENT CLASSIFICATIONS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'Civil Rights Law'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001648', 'className': 'SUITS & CLAIMS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000DLPN', 'className': 'EMPLOYMENT HISTORY'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001020', 'className': 'LEGISLATION'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000DRER', 'className': 'CRITICAL RACE THEORY'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DN5F', 'className': 'ON DEMAND SERVICES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DLCR', 'className': 'RIDE SHARING SERVICES'}, {'score': '78', 'classCode': 'ST000DQ2M', 'className': 'INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000DPKP', 'className': 'BIG TECH'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}]}"
