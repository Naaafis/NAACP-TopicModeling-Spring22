"Top chefs bring the heat  It may not have been as intense as 'Hell's Kitchen,' but competing chefs at yesterday's Greater Boston Culinary Cook-Off certainly  brought their A game, heating things up on theNew England Food Show's main stage. Chefs Jason Bond of Bondir, Bill Brodsky of Boston Nightlife Ventures and David Ladner of Rialto were given local scallops and New Zealand lamb as the main ingredients to create an appetizer and entree with.  Judges Scott Kearnan (Zagat), Henry Santoro (Radio BDC) and myself were tasked with awarding points for taste, presentation and creativity, and the gorgeous emcee Jenny Johnson chatted up us, the audience and chefs with her signature, fun-loving banter. Students from Le Cordon Bleu served dishes (prepped by the celeb chefs and their trusty sous chefs) to judges and a three-person panel of lucky audience members who scored their special seat by answering food-related trivia questions. Each dish was spectacular, but in the end, Bond's perfect presentation tipped the scales in his favor, making him the winner of this year's cook-off - and of five Benjamin Franklins to boot. Sponsored by the Mass-achusetts Restaurant Association, the New England Food Show is the region's largest B2B trade event for restaurants, retailers and food-service pros.

"Wilfork goes out a legend Lineman leaves Pats for Texans Vince Wilfork will be immortalized as a Patriot, but like so many, he won't be a Patriots lifer. The seven-time captain and five-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman signed with the Texans yesterday after a positive two-day visit with the Houston brass. Wilfork landed a two-year, $9 million contract, which included $5 million in guaranteed money, according to a source. And so ends Wilfork's 11-year run with the Patriots. The 2004 first-round pick opened his reign by surging to the top of the defensive tackle depth chart and becoming a fierce contributor for a Super Bowl champion. His tenure concluded with another victory on the world's greatest stage, and he was vindicated after returning from a torn Achilles while continuing as the defense's most prominent leadership presence. 'Few players reached or will ever reach the special level of Vince Wilfork,' Pats coach Bill Belichick said. 'He is a great champion and one of the classiest people I have ever been around, just a kind, genuine and giving person who was all about our team, football, winning and bringing joy to others. There may have never been anyone at his position with as much strength, toughness, intelligence, instinctiveness and athleticism. He is the best defensive lineman I ever coached, an all-time great Patriot whose place on our team will be missed but whose remarkable career as a Patriot will be remembered forever.' Wilfork was expected to take his time on the free agent circuit, but there was an obvious connection to Texans coach Bill O'Brien, defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel and linebackers coach Mike Vrabel, all former Patriots employees. He will now play alongside Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt and last year's No. 1 overall draft pick, Jadeveon Clowney. So, Wilfork made the quick decision after his first tour, spurning supposed interest from AFC contenders such as the Colts and Ravens. The Patriots declined Wilfork's option on March 5 for the 2015 and 2016 seasons, which saved $8 million against the cap in 2015. But because Wilfork never closed the door on a return in his initial statement and the Patriots hadn't acknowledged the transaction until last night, there was a popular belief the two sides could still indeed reunite. They mended fences after much more contentious negotiations in 2009, 2010 and 2014, and this split seemed amicable. 'I've been very blessed and privileged to play up there and learn from the best coach that has ever done it,' Wilfork said. 'Also, to play with one of the best quarterbacks that's in the game. From my teammates, there's nothing but love for them. They are brothers to me. The fans always treated me with respect. We had a lot of fun. I had a lot of fun in New England, and I'm going to cherish all of that. Because at the end of the day, I've been there for 11 years, so it's hard to close that door on my teammates, my fans, my coaches and the owner.' Wilfork is a shoo-in for the Patriots Hall of Fame, and those in and around the team fondly will remember the classy way he handled the past two weeks. Of course, Wilfork won't go wire-to-wire as a Patriot, just like Ty Law, Willie McGinest, Lawyer Milloy, Richard Seymour and Logan Mankins before him. The business side can often be football's reaper. Belichick has roamed NFL sidelines for 40 years, and he proclaimed to have never coached a defensive lineman better than Wilfork. That timeless impression will spark everlasting memories of Vince Wilfork.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hillary's modus operandi not pretty 'Nasty' GOP latest excuse for private email use Just when you thought we were done with emailgate, along comes James Carville to shed light on the matter. In defending Hillary Clinton's decision to use a private server for her emails, Carville on ABC's 'This Week' Sunday justified Clinton's actions as a 'reasonable' means of preventing the Republican Congress from 'rifling through her emails.' Wait. Rewind the tape. Didn't Clinton tell us that she set up the private server to avoid carrying two devices? And now Carville claims that she did it to hide from those nasty Republicans? Which is it? Clinton's excuse - that she sought to avoid fumbling with two phones - is laughable. Any kid can tell you that a single device is capable of displaying emails from multiple accounts and that professionals routinely set up their hand-held devices to do just that. Carville's excuse - that it is the GOP's fault - is classic Clintonian finger-pointing. By insinuating that Republicans have some sort of prurient interest in emails between Bill and Hillary Clinton, Carville makes Clinton's actions seem rational. After all, who among us would want our private communications spilled to the world?   But Carville's suggestion that Republican lawmakers were on some dystopian quest to monitor Clinton's private life is not only paranoid, but historically inaccurate - at the time Clinton set up her account on the private server, Democrats (not Republicans) controlled both houses of Congress (and thus the ability to subpoena State Department records). In truth, GOP lawmakers have not questioned Clinton's decision to use a private email account for truly private emails. Everyone does that. They have, however, raised questions about Clinton's decision to conduct government business on a private server - a server designed to keep things secret. (When did Hillary Clinton decide to become not just the secretary of state but the secretary of IT?) Carville's comments, while intended to hurt Republicans, inadvertently reveal the truth: Clinton created the account to avoid congressional oversight. (As part of its long-established authority to oversee federal agencies, Congress has every right to review government emails.) Upon becoming secretary of state, Clinton could have chosen to use a government email account for all communications. More appropriately, she could have chosen to use the government email for work matters and a separate private account for personal matters. She chose neither approach. Instead, Clinton set up a private server - not for administrative simplicity, but for political expedience. Clinton could not have known at that time what controversies lay ahead. But controversies she knew there would be. So she took measures to protect herself, knowing that when her decision to hide her emails eventually came to light, she could fall back on 'administrative convenience' and count on her ol' friend James Carville to blame any criticism of her Highness on the 'vast right-wing conspiracy.' This, of course, is strategy No. 1 in the Clinton playbook: Protect your political future at all costs, even if you have to break a few rules. After all, rules are technicalities that apply only to little people, not to the enlightened few who are destined to make the world a better place. That Clinton later instructed her minions to delete all so-called personal emails proves that her motive was not administrative but the avoidance oversight. Why, if one had a personal and secure server would one bother to delete all allegedly personal emails? The only plausible explanation is so that nobody can challenge whether those emails are, in fact, strictly personal. This controversy is about more than just transparency. It's about the character and modus operandi of HRC. And it's not pretty. Jennifer C. Braceras is a lawyer and political commentator.

"Coen brings NU up to speed on ND  Pulling Bill Coen away from basketball is a tough thing to do. While his team waited, and waited, for Sunday's NCAA tournament selection show to come around, the Northeastern men's basketball coach decided to watch some of the other conference tourneys after his Huskies had wrapped up the Colonial Athletic Association's automatic bid, knowing there was a possibility he would have to game-plan for one of the teams. Like many, Coen tuned in to a Duke game and watched a team steamroll one of the power teams in the country. Then, a day later, he watched that same team pick apart North Carolina like it was standing still with a 24-2 run in the second half to win the ACC tournament. That team was Notre Dame.  Coen picked the right team to view.  The 14th-seeded Huskies will have to figure out how to slow down third-seeded Notre Dame on Thursday in the second round of the NCAA tournament in Pittsburgh. 'Coach (Mike) Krzyzewski hasn't figured it out (for Duke) and (North Carolina's) Roy Williams hasn't figured it out. I don't know if I can figure it out by Thursday,' Coen said jokingly yesterday after practice at the Cabot Center. 'It's going to take our best. . . . We are going to need guys to have multiple efforts on every possession. Guys are going to have to help guys. Guys are going to have to shrink the floor and then recover to shooters, box out the weakside. We are going to need maximum effort to cover the floor.' The Irish are one of the most complete offensive teams in the tournament, with Pat Connaughton (Arlington/St. John's Prep), Jerian Grant, Steve Vasturia and Demetrius Jackson all able to beat defenders with the dribble to score or create opportunities for others. Notre Dame was second in the ACC in scoring average (78.5) and led the conference in field goal percentage (50.9) and 3-point percentage (38.9). In three of their past four games, the Irish have managed to shoot 50 percent or better from the field. '(It's about) being in a stance at all times and being prepared,' Northeastern redshirt junior swingman Quincy Ford said of defending against Notre Dame. 'We have to be ready to defend and want to win.' The best way for the Huskies to take the steam out of the Irish is to limit their possessions. When they have the ball, the Huskies will need to pass it around and use up clock. The more time Northeastern spends on offense, the less opportunities on the other end for Notre Dame. Turnovers have led to problems for the Huskies. Coen understands that carelessness with the basketball will lead to bad things for his team. He watched what the Irish did to North Carolina when the Tar Heels got sloppy with the ball in the ACC title game. 'You cannot turn the ball over against them,' Coen said. 'They are elite, maybe the best team, in transition. They play three, four, even five guards at one time. Their frontcourt players can all put the ball down. If they get a steal anywhere they can all dribble, finish and make a play. That is going to be a major emphasis for us. We have to be near a season low in turnovers in order to compete.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Keep off the grass  The devil is - as it has always been - in the details of the Boston 2024 Olympic effort. Now the planning process has come under attack on two fronts. And all the ex-Patrick administration folks on the payroll can't set things right if those details remain on the far side of lunatic. Yesterday the head of the House Transportation Committee, Bill Strauss (D-Mattapoisett), issued a statement calling on Boston 2024 to provide details on its final decisions on venues and come up with the money for an independent review of the impact and the cost to the public sector. 'I do not want to see the public left out of the discussion by only learning in mid-September of this year where Boston 2024 is intending to locate specific events,' Strauss said. His comments come just days after the respected Friends of the Public Garden announced their opposition to use of the Boston Common for beach volleyball and parts of the Public Garden itself for ancillary uses as a path to the marathon and road cycling events. Despite the fact that the beach volleyball idea with its 16,000-seat stadium sounded like a bad joke, the Common has, of course, hosted lots of large public gatherings - not 16,000-seat large - but substantial. But we're frankly grateful for the work of the Friends, who raise substantial amounts of money and donate thousands of man hours to keeping both parks the wonderful places that they are, for getting under the hood of the Olympics proposal. Because the bottom line is that it is simply horrifying. The beach volleyball plan calls for the removal of 50 mature trees on the Common, the board said in an announcement posted on its website. Putting a security fence around an area they calculate at some 32 acres for a construction timeline estimated at seven months would mean 'mostly likely the areas impacted would be unavailable for as long as a year including post-event restoration.' Thus displacing some 35,000 people who 'use this as their neighborhood park and many thousands more from every neighborhood and beyond Boston [who] use it for various forms of recreation and civic gathering. ... This use would reverse centuries of tradition.' It would be easy to accuse the Friends of the Public Garden of simply being guilty of that old 'not in my backyard' syndrome. But the fact remains that the Common and the Public Garden are treasures beloved by locals and sought out by tourists. What is the point of hosting an Olympics if it puts off-limits to non-ticket holders the very heart of the real Boston? And that's what this most foolish part of the Boston 2024 effort proposes to do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Elgort runs toward new challenge with 'Insurgent'  LOS ANGELES - A year after his breakthrough success as cancer patient Gus in 'The Fault in Our Stars,' Ansel Elgort returns to his role as Caleb, brother of Tris (Shailene Woodley) in the 'Divergent' sequel 'Insurgent.' 'It's a big franchise so that's nice, and it's something dramatically totally different from Gus,' said Elgort (21 as of last Saturday). As the first film ended, Caleb and Tris saw their mother and father killed; 'Insurgent' finds them traumatized and on the run. The siblings, he said during a one-on-one interview at the Four Seasons hotel, 'change a lot.'  That's an understatement - Caleb abandons his protective sister and her lover Four (Theo James) to return to the scarily powerful leader Jeanine, played by Kate Winslet. Does he become a villain? 'No! He makes that decision because he thinks they're wrong. They want to start a war, assassinate Jeanine. He thinks they're crazy.    'He thinks, 'What is going on? I can't be a part of this. I'm not cut out for this.' You see the way he's running? He can't keep up with them, he's not that type of guy. He's not a Dauntless' - the warrior faction.    'Caleb's an Erudite' - the brainy, scientific faction of biochemists, doctors - 'and as an Erudite, he's looked up to Jeanine for so long he's sort of been brainwashed by her.   'He thinks Jeanine will lead them to peace and not let war happen. If that means getting rid of a few Divergents' - which would include his sister - 'that's fine.' Elgort relished the chance to look gawky and geeky as he lags behind the film's heroic couple, Tris and Four. 'Caleb's more of a character role inside an action film. He's not an action hero. I wanted to represent the intellectual who maybe wouldn't be a good runner. 'The problem with these movies sometimes is everyone is a ... superhero. And he's not. And it wouldn't make sense for him to be running perfectly and then to say, 'I'm not cut out for this.' 'For me, I'm a very physical guy, I rock climb and play basketball. If you watch the film, the way Caleb runs, he looks like he will trip over something. So it was a conscious decision.'

"RETAILERS FEAR TRASHED STREETS Mess left beneath snow piles could slow return to normal With dirty snowbanks still lining many streets, Boston is looking at another month or more of grit, dirt and litter before the city begins street sweeping, leaving many businesses worried that all of the trash left behind by melting snow will turn off local customers and tourists. 'After this very tough winter for main streets, it is vital consumers be encouraged and welcomed back into our local stores and restaurants,' said Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts. 'Easter is April 5, and the spring shopping season has begun. The sooner the snow is gone, the streets are clean, all parking is back, and consumers feel like they can go downtown, not just to the mall, the better. A pleasant shopping environment is important to attract consumers who have mall and Internet options.' At a City Council hearing yesterday on the city's spring cleanup and street-sweeping strategy, Interim Public Works Commissioner Michael Dennehy said with all the snow that is still left, beginning street sweeping on the annual start date - April 1 - will likely be an 'impossibility.' So it's been postponed until curbs and gutters are free of ice and snow, Bonnie McGilpin, a spokeswoman for Mayor Martin J. Walsh, said, and the mayor's office will notify residents when street cleaning will resume once a date is finalized. In the meantime, McGilpin said, cars that park on the sides of a street that is posted for cleaning on certain weekdays beginning April 1 will not be ticketed. As the record 108.6 inches of snow that hammered Boston this winter melts, the city has been 'stuck with incredible amounts of trash,' Councilor Matt O'Malley said. 'We have to do better with trash pickup in the business districts, especially on the main streets,' said Michael Reiskind of Jamaica Plain Shines, an anti-litter campaign launched by the Jamaica Plain Business and Professional Association. Since last week alone, crews have hauled away about 200 tons of debris, Dennehy said. And from May 5, 2014, to last Friday, the city issued 58,000 tickets to people for putting trash out on the wrong day - compared to 38,000 tickets over the same period a year earlier - 'to deter bad behavior,' he said. 'Mayor Walsh and his team are doing everything they can to clear the streets of both snow and debris as quickly as possible,' said Paul Guzzi, president and CEO of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. 'It is a priority in every neighborhood, but it will take time.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Night of the laughing dead CW's 'iZombie' mixes horror, mystery, comedy It's the 'Walking Dead'  'Quincy'/'Psych' mashup you didn't know you wanted. But give 'iZombie' a chance. You just might love it. CW, home to the DC Comics hits 'Arrow' and 'Flash,' dips into the medium again for this horror dramedy loosely based on the book from DC's mature reader imprint Vertigo. Dr. Olivia Moore (Rose McIver, 'Masters of Sex') - Liv Moore to her friends, get it? - could be a Meredith Grey clone as she saves patients and plans her wedding to her dreamy fiance, Major Lilywhite (Rob Buckley, 'One Tree Hill,' '666 Park Avenue').  One night, the super-overachiever decides to take a night off and go to a party on a boat.  What could possibly go wrong? The living dead crash the festivities.  In the mayhem, one (David Anders, 'Alias') scratches Liv.  Before you can say walker, biter, roamer or any other of those cute AMC euphemisms, she pops out of a body bag as a zombie.  She barely has a pulse. Her skin and hair turn the color of chalk.  Those aren't the worst parts. The worst part is the hunger for brains.  Afraid of hurting her loved ones, Liv dumps her fiance and spends the next six months essentially zoning out in front of the TV, becoming a different kind of zombie, a slacker. She reluctantly takes a job in the coroner's office, where it is almost an all-you-can-eat brains buffet. There, she discovers a few surprises. Her colleague, Dr. Ravi Chakrabarti (Rahul Kohli), guesses her secret - and is eager to help her find a cure for her condition. And whenever she eats the brains of murder victims, she experiences flashes of memory that she passes on to Detective Clive Babineaux (Malcolm Goodwin, 'Breakout Kings') to solve the crime. She tells him she's a psychic. He doesn't believe her - until her clues prove to be solid.  Another side effect of her new diet: She picks up the personality traits of the deceased. Next week, as she investigates the murder of an artist who had several lovers, she finds herself unwittingly, hilariously getting frisky with all sorts of the wrong people.  'iZombie' is superbly cast and displays wit and surprises you don't often find in the comics-to-TV genre (cough, 'Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,' cough). Series co-creator Rob Thomas ('Veronica Mars') knows something about creating lovable female detectives. McIver seems to be adept at everything. Kohli has terrific timing. Buckley finally has a role that allows him to show his range at both comedy and drama. He's devastating next week as Liv's personality flips wreak havoc on his heart.  The gore level, in case  you're wondering, is so minor, it's almost negligible. You see more on 'Grey's Anatomy.' The murder mysteries, however, could be better developed. Tonight's is settled by one of the worst cliches in TV procedurals. To the show's credit, however, the mystery behind the zombie who attacked Liv takes a huge leap next week.  'iZombie' really is about one woman finding her determination to live again, regardless of her affliction. Not a bad premise for a show about a brain-muncher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sox see what's missing Harvey shows off top-of-rotation arm FORT MYERS - It's not just the results, the confidence, the poise, the give-me-the-ball, I'm-not-going-to-lose attitude. It's all of that, combined into one.  Matt Harvey has it. The Red Sox don't have a Matt Harvey, and they received a good reminder of that yesterday for four innings by one of baseball's best pitchers. 'If (the New York Mets) want to give him up, we'd certainly welcome him,' Sox manager John Farrell said jokingly. Against the Red Sox' best, Harvey, in his second start since missing all of last season following October 2013 elbow surgery, was better. 'He looked good,' David Ortiz said after going 0-for-2 against Harvey. 'His slider - powerful.' In a playoff-like at-bat in the third inning, Harvey threw a high-90s heater up in the strike zone to Dustin Pedroia, then came back with a 3-2 changeup that disappeared before it reached the plate and made the former AL MVP look like a minor league extra, if just for one horribly sloppy swing. 'He's a great guy,' Harvey said. 'It was a fun battle.' Harvey's changeup was 88 mph. 'He got me,' said Pedroia. 'He looked great.' Harvey was dominant, shutting out the Red Sox while holding a lineup full of regulars to three hits over four innings. He struck out three and his fastball touched 94 mph in the first inning, 97 in the second and 98 in the third. And then there's the changeup, the curveball and the slider. 'To see the power and the shape to secondary pitches - he's a heck of a pitcher,' Farrell said. Pitchers like Harvey are the reason why Clay Buchholz had to go out and make T-shirts that say, 'He's the ACE,' for every starter in the Red Sox rotation. None of the Sox starters have taken the step that Harvey has, from passed-over high school pitcher (23 were taken ahead of him in the 2007 draft), to college mop-up man during his second year at North Carolina, to first-round draft pick in 2010, to Cy Young contender. 'There are only a few guys in that caliber,' pitching coach Juan Nieves said recently of staff aces. 'Everybody else falls into that lower one just underneath that.' Once quoted in Sports Illustrated as saying, 'I want to be that guy when they know you're starting against them, they go, 'Oh crap,' ' Harvey's persona fits with his career 2.39 ERA. But he's also aware that one pitcher won't win a World Series. The Mets are far from playoff favorites, even in an NL East that should provide plenty of opportunities to win. New York isn't a longshot, either, because of their starting pitching depth. 'I think if you look at all of our guys, they could be aces,' Harvey said. 'I think once Opening Day is out of the way, the whole ace thing isn't really in our minds. It's nice when you're considered an ace and facing an ace because you have to work harder and try to outduel them. For that, it's special.' In Buchholz, Rick Porcello or Justin Masterson, maybe even Wade Miley or Joe Kelly, who left yesterday's start in the third inning with biceps soreness, the Red Sox have pitchers capable of putting up a sub-3.00 ERA. Buchholz has been there before, if only for short stints, and he's looked the part of a No. 1 this spring. Or the Red Sox, with plenty of financial flexibility and prospects to move, could try to make a trade. With the class of talented starting pitchers that might be available in July, there will be plenty of options. But there are only a few guys like Matt Harvey.

"Spandex-loving speeders want to be king of road  Just what we need here in Massachusetts - another new class of victims. This time it's bicyclists. Believe it or not, Spandex-Americans are seeking to become a protected class. I thought they already were! These sweaty, trust-funded, unshaven (of both sexes) cultists want to legally define their precious selves as 'vulnerable road users.' Of course, as cover, they also throw in cops, pedestrians, tow-truck drivers and other more sympathetic figures, but it's all about them. Kind of like they behave on the streets, right? And now they want more special perks. Haven't we already bestowed on bicyclists their own road version of affirmative action? It's called running red lights with impunity. Pick a road, any road. Comm. Ave. around Boston University, Harvard Street in Brookline or my favorite, Mass. Ave. in Cambridge. If you drive from Harvard Square to the Arlington line, you have to go through close to 10 traffic lights. Here's what happens on Mass. Ave. to the truly vulnerable road users - motorists. The driver approaches a bicyclist who is hogging the right lane. The driver has to slow down until traffic passes on the left. Then he passes the Beautiful Person on his $8,999 Scott Plasma Premium. Often the bicyclist gives the motorist a salute - a one-finger salute. A few streets further west, the next light on Mass. Ave. turns red. The motorist stops, but the bicyclist he has just passed cruises right through the light, in complete violation of the law, and is once again ahead of the motorist. The light turns green and the motorist closes in on the bicyclist who has just run a red light. Once again, the motorist slows, waits for a chance to get around the bicycle, guns the car and tries to get through the next light as it turns yellow, but can't make it. And the bicyclist cruises past him again on the right. Stop at a traffic light? I'm wearing Spandex, pal, I don't need to obey no stinkin' laws. These bicyclists want rights but no responsibilities. Who do they think they are, illegal aliens? If bicyclists want equal rights, let them pay equal taxes. Excise taxes, registration fees, inspections, etc. Have the Legislature pass a tax automatically increasing the tax every year on air pumps. One quote from these Lance Armstrong groupies: 'For too long, bicyclists have been simply tolerated instead of welcomed and protected in Massachusetts.' If you substitute the word 'motorists' for 'bicyclists,' I totally agree.

"Try to find method for Madness  There's no better feeling than filling out a bracket before one game has been played in the NCAA tournament. The hope and the chance to capture all the glory (and money) in a bracket pool is there for the taking on a clean sheet (or screen) full of potential winners. That is, before all the red comes out when games start getting played. There is no foolproof way to pick a bracket. Some people ask their grandmother or Timmy the neighborhood stat savant. Some get their dog to pick food out of bowls with team names on them. And there's always the method of picking your favorite uniforms or mascots. It doesn't matter how many games you've seen or how much 'studying' has been done. The brackets always win. But here are a few tidbits to make picking the games a little more fun: ·   Kentucky is the considerable favorite to win the national championship. But did you know that if the Wildcats run into Maryland or Notre Dame, some Massachusetts kids will get a chance to pull off a stunning upset? Maryland would face Kentucky in the Sweet 16, and that would give Wrentham's Jake Layman a shot a the spotlight. Barring upsets, a Kentucky-Notre Dame matchup is possible in the Elite Eight. The Irish have Arlington's Pat Connaughton, New Bedford's Bonzie Colson and Marlboro's Zach Auguste. It would be interesting to see if the local kids could slay Goliath and end the undefeated season. ·   Speaking of local, Harvard and Northeastern got tough draws in the second round (the first round involves only the four play-in games during the next two nights). The Crimson get a resurgent North Carolina team, while the Huskies attempt to derail one of the hottest teams in the country, Notre Dame. Maybe Northeastern could even get a shot at Kentucky with a Cinderella run. A win by either Boston team would be a pretty big upset. ·   Everybody has a team they never will pick again after being wronged in the past. For me, it's Georgetown, hands down. In the 2010 tournament, Greg Monroe and the Hoyas earned the No. 3 seed in the Midwest Regional after making believers out of everyone with a run to the Big East tourney championship game. But they lost to 14th-seeded Ohio and were done before their championship journey, at least in my bracket, could get started. Georgetown is the No. 4 seed in the South this time around and will try to hold off a 26-win Eastern Washington team. Think upset, and it's not personal. ·   Upsets are tough to pick. That's whey they are called upsets. But you have to pick one or two teams to do something that probably isn't predicted by the pundits. That's what makes the tournament great. For me, Stephen F. Austin could make a run to the Sweet 16 as a No. 12 seed because of its offensive firepower. Providence will have to wait for the winner of Boise State-Dayton, potentially play a virtual road game in Ohio vs. the Flyers, then beat third-seeded Oklahoma to get to the Sweet 16. It can happen. ·   Most of the heavyweights should be playing as the bracket starts to get smaller. The upper-echelon teams were so steady that seven teams were in the hunt for No. 1 seeds down the stretch. The best game of the tournament before the Final Four could be an Elite Eight matchup between Wisconsin and Arizona in the West. A dream scenario for a lot of defensive purists would be to see Kentucky and Virginia try to reach 50 points against each other in the national championship game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Architect rips plan to fill in 500 Boylston courtyard  An original architect of 500 Boylston St. in Boston's Back Bay took aim at owner Equity Office Properties' plans to infill the building's 'underutilized' courtyard with a five-story retail and office addition. 'It's a bad idea,' said John Burgee, who designed the award-winning 1989 building with esteemed architect Philip Johnson. Renderings haven't been released, but Burgee said the addition 'sounds like a blocking idea to fill up space. It puts a plug into (an) open space and obviously to maximize profit.' The existing building, which shares a full block with 222 Berkeley St., has a 19-story office tower atop a six-story retail/office base. 'The idea of the court was to make it feel like you were on Boylston Street as you entered the building beyond, so to block that with another building is defeating the purpose,' Burgee said. Equity also plans to convert 50,000 square feet of office space at 500 Boylston into retail, according to a letter filed with the city. Two new vestibules at 222 Berkeley's entrance would provide access to its second floor and 8,350 square feet of office space slated to become restaurant space. Equity said the changes would 'improve the retail experience and street edge' on Boylston Street and improve the pedestrian connection between Berkeley and Clarendon streets.  The project is a 'reflection of our belief in this terrific building and the overall strength of the Boston market,' senior vice president John Conley said. 'Quality tenants are challenging landlords to be constantly improving their properties in order to offer the best amenities and building features for their employees and customers.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Letters To the Editor  Voting for 'empty chair' In his op-ed, Michael Barone wonders who might be the Democratic candidate if Hillary Clinton doesn't get the nod ('If Hillary's unelectable, who's next,' March 14). The thing that he didn't mention is that in a general election almost half the voters, especially those getting government assistance of any type, will vote for an empty chair if it has a 'D' on it. - Jeff Padell, Walpole  Letting 'Sunshine' in The faculty of the School of Journalism at Northeastern University stands with the editorial efforts of the Boston Globe, Boston Herald and GateHouse MediaMassachusetts in calling for major reforms to the Massachusetts public records law ('Time for 'Sunshine',' March 14). As journalism educators, we were dismayed to learn recently that the state's already-weak law has been weakened still further through rulings issued by Secretary of State William Galvin's office. We find it astonishing that police departments can now withhold the names of officers charged with serious crimes such as drunken driving. Reform is long overdue. Journalists and citizens seeking public information are hampered by government agencies that respond slowly and incompletely (if at all) to their requests. Outrageously high fees for information and the lack of meaningful enforcement provisions add to the difficulties of obtaining documents. The Massachusetts Freedom of Information Alliance is calling for immediate action. It would be fitting if the Legislature and governor could agree on needed reforms this week, which is Sunshine Week, an annual celebration of open government. We support the alliance in its work to ensure that the public's right to know will be protected. - Dan Kennedy and 17 others, Northeastern University School of Journalism A chance for diplomacy Recently, 47 Republican U.S. senators sent a warning letter to Iranian leaders saying that any deal with President Obama could end when he leaves office ('GOP warns Iran: Deal with Obama could expire,' March 10). This was a misguided attempt to shape American foreign policy and undermine negotiations with Iran.  The organizer of the letter, U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ariz.) seems to want talks with Iran to fail. But diplomacy offers the best chance to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. This would resolve one of America's greatest national security concerns. Congress should not allow Cotton's attempts to derail the talks to succeed. Lawmakers should let the president do his job - and oppose legislation that gets in the way of negotiations. This means rejecting legislation aimed at increasing sanctions on Iran or mandating that Congress vote on any agreement reached. Give diplomacy a chance. - Sofia Gebru, Somerville",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cops give riveting firefight details Shed light on a.m. battle with Tsarnaevs The showdown with the bomb-tossing Tsarnaev brothers in Watertown brought everyone in federal court in Boston to the edge of their seats yesterday as police told of the face-to-face firefight. Watertown police Sgts. Jeffrey Pugliese and John MacLellan, along with patrolman Joseph Reynolds, said they found themselves in the Tsarnaevs' crosshairs when the brothers, fleeing an armed carjacking and the murder of MIT police officer Sean Collier, drew police into an ambush on Laurel Street in Watertown in the early-morning hours of April 19, 2013. 'We were about 6 to 8 feet at most from each other,' Pugliese, a firearms instructor, said of his confrontation with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who charged at the officer from the cover of a stolen Mercedes-Benz SUV. 'My pistol ran out of ammunition, and I had to reload in the middle of this battle. He was having problems with his (Ruger). I don't know if it jammed or ran out of ammunition. He looked at his gun, he looked at me, we looked at each other. I think out of frustration he threw the gun at me and it hit me in the left bicep,' Pugliese said. Leaving his then-19-year-old brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev behind crouching next to the Benz, Tamerlan ran straight at MacLellan and Reynolds, Pugliese said, but he tackled him to the ground facedown. 'The three of us were trying to get handcuffs on Tamerlan,' Pugliese said. 'I could hear an engine racing, and I saw the headlights moving toward me. It was accelerating at a very high rate of speed.' Dzhokhar, according to the officers, had gotten behind the wheel of the SUV and made a three-point turn.  'I reached down and grabbed Tamerlan by the back of the belt and I was trying to drag him out of the street. I was able to pull him about a foot,' Pugliese said. Finally heeding MacLellan's and Reynolds' screams for him to save himself, Pugliese recreated how he threw himself backward just as Dzhokhar ran over his brother.  'The front wheels went over Tamerlan. He got bounced up into the undercarriage,' he said. 'The vehicle dragged him about 35 to 40 feet. Tamerlan was hung up in the rear wheels.' As Reynolds fired a shot through the windshield, Tamerlan came loose as his brother plowed into Reynolds' empty cruiser, and then fled from the mayhem, later abandoning the SUV at Spruce and Lincoln streets. Tamerlan later died.  It was only after Dzhokhar vanished across the intersection with Dexter Avenue that investigators discovered responding transit police officer Richard 'Dic' Donohue bleeding to death in a driveway on Dexter from a stray bullet to his groin. Dr. Heather Studley, who treated Donohue at South Shore Hospital's emergency room, said he lost all 10 quarts of his blood and was technically dead for 45 minutes before being miraculously revived through transfusions, CPR and medication.

"Cruz slams amnesty to illegals  U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, spoke with Boston Herald Radio's Holly Robichaud yesterday about his possible presidential run: Q: Great job up in New Hampshire. Are they loving you out there? A: I'll tell you that the reception we received in New Hampshire has really been breathtaking. We've had standing-room-only crowds. ... It has been really encouraging. There's a lot of enthusiasm. People are hungry for a leader who is willing to tell the truth and stand up and do what he said he would do.  Q: Here in Massachusetts there's a lot of us worried about the illegal immigration problem, and now we got the president's amnesty to 5 million illegal immigrants to start off with. Has this ship sailed or could a President Cruz do something about this?  A: The president's executive amnesty - it is wrong. It is unfair to millions of legal immigrants who followed the rules. And it's patently unconstitutional. ... And indeed, someone who styles himself a constitutional scholar 22 times publicly made the point that it exceeds the president's authority to do that, and that person of course is Barack Obama, who 22 times previously said he had no authority to grant amnesty. In fact, in one of the times he explained, 'I am not an emperor.' Well, apparently after this last election after Democrats got walloped he discovered he was an emperor, and so he illegally and unconstitutionally granted amnesty to 4.5 million people. I along with millions of people across this country was heartbroken when Republican leadership just a couple of weeks ago capitulated entirely on amnesty. ... But there is a silver lining ... another branch of the government is doing its job, and that is Article 3, the federal judiciary. A federal court in the state of Texas has issued an injunction preventing President Obama's executive amnesty from going into effect. Q: I understand you've also been looking to see if the Obama administration has been breaking that court order? A: That is exactly right ... we will hold additional hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee to ascertain the degree to which the Obama administration is complying with that order. They need to obey the injunction from the federal court. They say that they are, but at the same time the federal court is having hearings on whether they have gone ahead and processed a number of amnesty applications in direct defiance of what they told the federal court what they would do.

"Chief justice, Suffolk DA joust over mandatory minimums  The chief justice of the state's highest court and Boston's top prosecutor are butting heads over whether there should be mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders - a legal battle that turns on who wields the power to hand out punishment. 'As long as prosecutors, rather than judges, hold the cards that determine sentences, we will not have individualized, evidence-based sentences,' SJC Chief Justice Ralph Gants said yesterday at a criminal justice conference at the University of Massachusetts Boston.  Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley struck back, saying mandatory minimum sentences have proven effective in stopping crime. He said giving judges discretion in sentencing on certain drug crimes was a 'failed policy' that has been off the books for decades. Crimes with mandatory minimums include trafficking, dealing and using or selling drugs in a school zone. 'There was complete, total and unfettered discretion prior to the institution and mandatory sentencing,' Conley told the Herald after the forum. 'Prosecutors who are making decisions on what sentences to bring and what charges to bring has driven down crime to unprecedented levels. It's part of prosecutors' toolbox, and I don't know how anyone can argue with it.' Gants said judges are better suited to craft sentences for each defendant. He added that mandatory minimum sentences have a 'disparate impact' on minorities. Conley said he doesn't impose mandatory minimum sentences in each case.  He said district attorneys are 'in a better position than a member of the judiciary to make the call on the amount of time those individuals ought to be incarcerated.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Make 'Madness' work at work Have fun and staff will go through hoops The phenomenon known as 'March Madness' has officially launched, and it's predicted that more than 60 million Americans will participate in some way. The question is: Will any work get done? Employees across the nation are sure to take time out of their workdays this week to research matchups, make selections and complete their brackets. If you're a manager, brace for the chaos. The cost of lost wages paid to preoccupied and unproductive workers could reach $1.9 billion, according to outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas Inc. Sports has long been renowned for its inherent ability to bring people together. Capitalize on it.  Companies have an opportunity to use the legendary NCAA college basketball tournament as a team-building experience.   The tourney can be used to help bolster morale and encourage interactions among co-workers and clients who may not normally cross paths. Astute managers will respond to the call.  The reality is, anyone with an iPhone or tablet can access March Madness updates on company time. As long as people are clearly going to engage, a manager can acknowledge the tradition and set some rules.   Managers should have a plan. Establish rules early, roll them out and be bold. Mandate any NCAA activity be done on an employee's own time - during lunch, on their break or after work. Or, try to be more creative. Designate 'bracket breaks' to help build camaraderie, using this to your firm's advantage. Build 15-minute 'bracket updates' into the day. Create a company-wide office pool (free to enter) and offer a free lunch or gift card for the winner and post results on office pools. Note: If money is on the table, this could get dicey and out-of-hand.  Employees should honor management's initiative in opening this up, respect rules and boundaries established and use this as an opportunity to schmooze clients! Above all, especially after the long, hard, record-breaking winter, enjoy the activity, the camaraderie and the winnings. Have fun with March Madness ... especially if you have a sales force!

"Krejci's return a tough fit  WASHINGTON - It seems a little odd to say it, but when center David Krejci returns to the Bruins lineup in the next week or so, coach Claude Julien will have to make a difficult decision. It's possible that Krejci, who has been sidelined with a partially torn MCL in his left knee since Feb. 20, will be ready to rejoin the team soon for practice. Today marks four weeks since he was hurt, and the initial prognosis was 4-6 weeks. After seeing their season-saving, eight-game points streak (7-0-1) end with Sunday's 2-0 loss in Washington, the B's got a day off and will skate today ahead of tonight's home game against the Buffalo Sabres. They visit Ottawa on Thursday, and Krejci could return during back-to-back games in Florida this weekend against the Panthers (Saturday) and Lightning (Sunday). But on what line? Given the play of his replacement, Ryan Spooner (three goals, five assists in his past nine games), it's hard to imagine Julien automatically plugging Krejci back onto the line with wingers Milan Lucic and David Pastrnak. That would shake up a threesome whose speed and offensive prowess have spurred the team's recent surge. When the B's have needed a goal, the Spooner line has been on the ice. And what would Julien do with Spooner, give him a seat in the pressbox? Play him as the fourth-line center and on the power play? Give him the third-line center spot in place of Carl Soderberg, who hasn't scored a goal since Jan. 17? Or Julien could leave Spooner where he is. Maybe Krejci is the one who needs to relocate, at least temporarily, to a wing spot. There's more to the Krejci/Spooner decision than just the talent of the two players. Julien also must take into consideration the fact Lucic has been more effective in recent weeks playing with the two youngsters. Both Spooner and Pastrnak play at high speed, forcing Lucic to pick up his tempo and energy. 'Right now, this young line he's with is a real good skating line,' Julien said. 'We've always said when (Lucic) skates, that's when he's at his best. Those guys have probably forced him to skate even more. '(Krejci) is a guy who will slow down the pace of the game and make good plays. When he's got good wingers with him, he will feed them on the fly. Right now, with (Lucic), it's about keeping up with those young, quick legs on his line. It's helped his game a lot.' Lucic is quick to defend Krejci as a great linemate but acknowledges the speed and enthusiasm of his young linemates have helped him. 'A lot of people don't view my game as a skating game,' Lucic said. 'But when I'm skating, that's when I'm most effective, when I'm moving my feet and (playing) that straight-line kind of hockey you can only play if your legs are going.' Pushing the pace has made Lucic a more effective forechecker and playmaker. Defenders give him much more room when he's bearing down on them at high speed, and in his past eight games, he has seven points (three goals) with a plus-2 rating. 'It seems to be the reason why I've had success as of late, playing with these guys,' he said. 'On the other hand, (Krejci) does like to slow the game down. I figured out playing with him how to get my feet going in the past. Unfortunately, it hasn't worked out that great for both of us this year. 'But I think if you're looking at right now, it is a good thing playing that type of style, that quick, skating game. It's definitely gotten me more involved than I had been earlier in the season. 'I'd still love to have had a healthy Krejci all year,' Lucic added. 'Who knows where I'd be at if he was healthy all year. I definitely miss him, but (Spooner) has definitely done a good job fitting in since he's been up here.' Spooner doesn't want to talk about Krejci's return. 'I'm trying not to think about it,' he said. 'I'm just trying to play well. I think they've always had the mindset here that if a player plays well, then they'll make a spot for you. I'm just trying to help the team.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"'Vulnerable' cyclists could get protections  Bike-friendly Beacon Hill lawmakers want to put the brakes on drivers who share streets with pedal pushers and ban stopping in bike lanes - designating cyclists as 'vulnerable road users' - but motorized citizens say the proposed rules could make life even harder for senior citizens, truck operators and average drivers. 'The bigger threat is to someone who's not surrounded by a ton of steel. That's why cyclists are vulnerable,' said state Rep. David Rogers (D-Cambridge), whose two bills already have nearly 30 legislative co-sponsors. One would punish drivers parked in bike lanes with an up-to-$100 fine; the second would label cyclists as 'vulnerable users' and define buffer zones of 3 or more feet that drivers must allow when passing. A third bill filed by state Rep. Denise Provost (D-Somerville) would mandate a 25 mph speed limit for drivers on certain roads that are 40 feet wide and feature bike lanes and street parking. Some cities, including Boston and Cambridge, already have the $100 fines on the books. 'Whoever's doing the enforcement, they should look at the situation. If you have someone taking out their shopping because they went shopping and their car's in front of their house because there's no parking - in Charlestown people can't park in front of their houses,' said Boston City Councilor Sal LaMattina. He added that some drivers picking up their elderly friends and relatives would also suffer. 'For every person we can encourage to ride a bike, we can create one more parking space,' said Richard Fries of MassBike. But driver Richard Webb of Cambridge said cyclists practically have roadway amnesty already. 'They have too many rights, first and foremost,' Webb said. 'And if they do anything wrong, what are they going to get fined for? They already think they run the road.' Sarah Kimball of Boston, who was hit by a truck a year ago, said protecting cyclists is important. 'It's dangerous for the bicyclists when someone stops in the bike lane and you have to swerve into traffic around them,' Kimball said. 'Safety should come before convenience.' John Lin's Savory Food truck was parked in the bike lane on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge yesterday because snow blocked the parking spot, but he said he supports the bill. 'I hope people understand - it's not like we intend to block,' Lin said.

"Right where C's belong Win streak hits five as foes take notice The Celtics' reputation continued to shine last night as one of the most improbable makeovers of the NBA season keeps looking prettier. They finished the proceedings in a three-way tie with Indiana and Miami for seventh playoff seed in the Eastern Conference, though the Pacers and Heat currently have tiebreaker edges thanks to better conference records. More importantly right now, though, the Celtics actually look like they belong there. 'I think they've improved a lot defensively since the last time we played them,' Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said after the Celtics swept the season series with a 108-89 win - their fifth straight, and their longest win streak of the Brad Stevens era. They have also won seven of their last eight and eight of their last 11. 'They've always had that firepower, the ability to score, but you can see a team that's right there to slide into the playoffs. We give them credit,' said Brown. Individual reputations are thriving, too. Tyler Zeller, who has quite possibly enjoyed the best two weeks of his NBA career, was given open space all night by the Sixers' reluctant big men, and he made them pay with a career-high 26-point, 11-for-15 performance. With Jared Sullinger out for the season, the seven-footer has popped out to mid-range to hit a steady diet of jumpers. Over the last two games Zeller has shot 19-for-25 as Indiana's Roy Hibbert and Philadelphia's Nerlens Noel have opted to give him open shots. '(The coaches) yelled at me a couple of times when nobody was within 5 feet of me and I didn't shoot it,' Zeller said of his progression this season. 'But with (Rajon) Rondo, if you can take a layup I'm going to take a layup over a jump shot. He does a great job of finding it. Now they've started packing it in recently, so now I'm trying to shoot it.' Zeller's contribution was only part of the Celtics' wave last night. They opened with a 38-point first quarter and never led by fewer than 16 points the rest of the way. The Celtics finished the game shooting an even 50 percent, including 40 percent (8-for-20) from 3-point range, and placed seven players in double figures, including all five starters. Avery Bradley broke out of a short slump with 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists, and Jae Crowder and Gigi Datome scored 10 each off the bench. 'It's nice when you have a game where you're making every shot, but that's one of those nights, and one of those nights is called that for a reason,' he said recently. 'You're not going to have it very often.' The event is also rewarding when it erupts like this. 'I think it's the continuity of the guys that have been here the whole time; they've really helped and really helped the way in a lot of ways,' Stevens said of his players, like Bradley, Brandon Bass and Zeller, who have survived the hailstorm of trades that rocked his roster this season. 'And then I just think our additions have been good; good, solid team guys that will compete, that are there helping each other and supporting one another,' said the Celtics coach. Players like Bradley can now claim they even saw this recent success coming. 'I saw that we were improving every single game and I knew we would have a chance if we set our mind to it and started speaking to it, and that's what we were doing,' said Bradley. 'We never thought we didn't have a chance to make the playoffs. Now we're right there.' And here's a bonus: The rest of the league is starting to notice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But driver Richard Webb of Cambridge said cyclists practically have roadway amnesty already. 'They have too many rights, first and foremost,' Webb said. 'And if they do anything wrong, what are they going to get fined for? They already think they run the road.' Sarah Kimball of Boston, who was hit by a truck a year ago, said protecting cyclists is important. 'It's dangerous for the bicyclists when someone stops in the bike lane and you have to swerve into traffic around them,' Kimball said. 'Safety should come before convenience.' John Lin's Savory Food truck was parked in the bike lane on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge yesterday because snow blocked the parking spot, but he said he supports the bill. 'I hope people understand - it's not like we intend to block,' Lin said. 'All the cars are parked farther from the sidewalk due to the snow.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Good to see Philly again 76ers provide little opposition A Monday night game in mid-March against the 76ers is grounds for no big whoop. Except when you're the Celtics and you've been granted, through good deeds of your own and grace of the Eastern Conference, admission to the playoff race . . . and you look at your itinerary and see a flight to Oklahoma City today and one from there to San Antonio later in the week. Then a date with the Philadelphians becomes a desperate, must-have, don't-leave-home-without-it outing. Lose this one, and even if Russell Westbrook gets a head cold tomorrow and Gregg Popovich decides to rest his first seven on Friday, you're still looking at a rough week. So it was comforting for the 'we don't need no stinking lottery pick' crowd that the Celtics went ahead by 22 in the first quarter and kept pushing all the way to a 108-89 victory. Maybe it was because Philly didn't push back all that much, but the C's avoided their fate from eight nights prior when they took a 20-point lead a minute into the second quarter in Orlando - and lost. Losing on your home floor to the team with the third-worst record in the NBA would have come packaged with a side order of insult. Then again, as Evan Turner put it after 10 points and five assists against his old team, 'Every loss really sucks. 'When we gave the game away in Orlando, that really sucked. When we gave the game away versus the Golden State Warriors, that really sucked. When we gave a game away versus the Kings, that sucked. If we would have taken care of those, we probably wouldn't have to worry too much. Now we need every win we possibly can get.' This victory means the Celts are assured of being in touch with Indiana, Miami and Charlotte in what is currently a four-team musical chairs competition for the last two playoff seats in the East. 'I just think all the games are ones we really need,' Turner said. 'We're in like a four-way tie every other day, so we can't really pick and choose. We need every single game we can possibly get.' Dining on the 76ers before meeting the Thunder and Spurs was akin to what many a wise person was doing on St. Patrick's Eve. Getting a little nourishment before hitting the hard stuff. 'Yeah, for sure,' Jae Crowder said. 'We are aware that we needed this win tonight. Now we just have to see how it plays out on the road.' After last night was in the books, coach Brad Stevens turned the page quickly. 'We're going on a tough road trip,' Stevens said. 'That's really all I'm thinking about right now.' Looking at the importance of this one in the postseason-drive scheme of things, Stevens said, 'I don't know. I haven't heard them talk about it once. I'm dead serious. I mean, we've talked about it. We've seen the standings, but I don't hear it. I have not heard them say whoever Miami's playing today, or who's Charlotte playing today? They haven't talked about it around me. Maybe they are; I don't know. 'But I just want to play good basketball. I think our guys just want to play good basketball, and I think as a result you have a lot more fun when you spray the ball around the way we're spraying it around and when you're competing together and pulling for one another and five guys playing together on a string defensively. And we're still not as good as we need to be, but I think our team that's out there right now without Isaiah (Thomas) can play better. And you know, we're going to need to play better in the next two games to have a chance to win.' The now 15-52 Sixers gave the Celtics very little chance to lose. No, the visitors are not exactly the pushovers they were last season, and, yes, they have quality wins over Cleveland and Atlanta, but the former came when the Cavaliers were without LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. The Philly fate was sealed before tipoff on opening night. There is no Selection Sunday for it to sweat. The NIT is not on line 2. In the third quarter, Avery Bradley cleanly removed the ball from Luc Mbah a Moute's hands as he drove. Bradley was, however, called for a shooting foul. Under normal circumstances, Bradley and the Garden crowd would be incensed. But, ahead by 20 points, no one had the heart to complain. It would have been unsportsmanlike to whine. The Celtics went ahead and completed the four-game season sweep of the Sixers, each win by double figures for an average margin of 14.75. Now the opponents become rather more frightening. 'How scary?' Crowder said. 'No, it's exciting. It's good basketball. We're playing the top teams. It's fun.' Crowder may be whistling past the dentist's office a bit on that one, for this will be a root canal of a road trip. Good thing the Celts flossed with Philly before they left.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Serve them Wright If Kelly's out, team can lean on veteran knuckler FORT MYERS - One starting pitcher down, the Red Sox could turn to a knuckleballer to round out their staff. It all depends how Joe Kelly feels in the coming weeks. Kelly couldn't put any spin on the ball yesterday, when he felt biceps tightness in his right throwing arm during warmups and tried to pitch through it during a Grapefruit League game against the New York Mets. Kelly tried throwing mostly fastballs and changeups, but even that hurt. The final pitch came in the third inning, when Kelly already had allowed three runs on seven hits and the pain became too obvious for the Red Sox to ignore. Sox manager John Farrell and the training staff ran out to look at Kelly and immediately took him out of the game. 'Yeah, they saw me kind of shaking my arm a little more than usual and asked me what's wrong,' Kelly said. 'I said, 'My biceps (are) little tight and a little achy.' It progressively got a little bit worse.' Kelly said he's dealt with a similar issue in the past and gotten over it quickly. 'Usually it gets knocked out pretty quick,' he said. 'Just a little bit of work in the training room and not really a whole lot of rest. Just kind of got to get through it yourself and eventually it goes away.' As hopeful as the Red Sox are that Kelly won't have to miss time, this spring has been anything but fluid for the 26-year-old. He was throwing fastballs in the high-80s during his first start, and when he was asked if he had reached the high-90s in his second outing, Kelly candidly answered, 'That's probably false. My arm doesn't feel that good.' The Red Sox' sixth starter, should Kelly have to miss time, would likely be 30-year-old knuckleballer Steven Wright. Behind Wright, the Sox aren't exactly flush with starting pitching depth - their next-best option could be Matt Barnes, whose only major league experience came out of the bullpen, and a few highly regarded prospects who the Red Sox prefer not to rush to the majors. Wright was impressive in posting a 2.57 ERA over 21 innings with the Red Sox last year and has developed into a two-speed knuckleball pitcher who can consistently throw them for strikes. He walked just 22 batters in 95 innings with Triple-A Pawtucket last year. 'I feel like I'm ready for whatever job they want me to do, whether it's in Boston or Pawtucket,' Wright said. 'Hopefully it's in Boston at some point, but I feel confident to where if I just keep doing what I'm doing, working with (pitching coach Juan Nieves and former knuckler Tim Wakefield), I'm ready whenever they call upon me to go out there and compete.' Rusney's return on tap Rusney Castillo should be in the Red Sox lineup tomorrow. Castillo, who has been out since March 4 with a left oblique strain, has experienced no restrictions in his recovery. 'He's passed every baseball physical test that's we've put him in front of to date,' Farrell said. Still, it'll be an uphill climb for the 27-year-old to out-duel Mookie Betts for the starting center field job. After going 2-for-3, including a double high off the left-field wall against Matt Harvey, Betts is 10-for-23 this spring. Spring in his step He's usually seen carrying equipment bags and frequently shuttles between whichever minor league team needs a catcher most, but yesterday, Matt Spring had a moment to remember. The 30-year-old career minor leaguer hit a home run off Mets prospect Noah Syndergaard. Spring, who has spent 11 years in the minors (the last four in the Red Sox organization) has never appeared in a major league game and played in just eight spring training games. 'The most important thing is my son (Bo) was watching at home,' Spring said. 'He's 2. I ranked over Mickey Mouse, so that's great.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cops: 'Stare down' sparked gunfight that killed woman  A tension-filled 'stare down' between rivals last summer led to the gunfire that killed a 26-year-old Brighton woman who was an innocent bystander a block away, on her way to the city's Caribbean festival, police and prosecutors said. Wesson Colas, 22, pleaded not guilty yesterday in Suffolk Superior Court to first-degree murder and assault charges for allegedly pointing a gun at a group shortly after a confrontation inside a Blue Hill Avenue store on Aug. 23. Once outside, Colas was shot at, and one round fatally struck Dawnn Jaffier in the head, authorities said. Although Colas did not fire the shot that killed Jaffier, 26, he is facing first-degree murder for inciting the gunplay because he was first to raise a weapon, said Assistant District Attorney Mark Lee. 'That precipitated gunfire,' Lee said yesterday, noting Jaffier was struck by a stray bullet about a block away. Authorities said a 20-year-old woman three blocks away was struck in the leg by another errant bullet. Keith Williams, 18, the suspected triggerman, also faces a first-degree murder charge. The Suffolk DA's office said Colas was indicted on a theory of murder under a 1997 Supreme Judicial Court ruling  that, 'Where the defendant chooses to engage in a gun battle with another with the intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm and a third party is killed, the defendant may be held liable for the homicide even if it was the defendant's opponent who fired the fatal shot.' Defense attorney Peter T. Marano accused prosecutors of overreaching. 'The theory of trying my client for murder, I think, is a strong stretch.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dzhokhar could've sailed into paradise  About the only defense Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers have offered so far is to let the jury know how he envied his big brother Tamerlan's entrance into paradise as a martyr. 'I'm jealous of my brother who has received the reward of jannutul Firdaus (inshallah) before me,' Dzhokhar scribbled in pencil on the inside wall of David Henneberry's runabout 'Slip Away II,' perched on a trailer behind his Watertown home on that fateful April night two years ago. Slip Away II immediately ceased to be a boat and became a 24-foot piece of evidence in the marathon bombing trial ... one that jurors got to see close-up yesterday. But what they actually saw in a nondescript Southie warehouse was Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's ticket to paradise - the one he chose not to use. Let's face it, if the younger jihadist really wanted to join his older brother in the afterlife, all he had to do when an army of state and local police unleashed hellfire on Slip Away II was stand up, or at the very least lift his head, and he certainly would have been a lot closer to the gates of paradise. Instead, Dzhokhar chose, as the prosecution noted, to wrap his arms around the engine compartment and hang on for dear life. Somehow, Dzhokhar managed to survive a blizzard of bullets to stand up and fall out of the boat, bloodied by non-life-threatening injuries that were only going to get him as far as a federal prison hospital ... not paradise. Yesterday, as jurors were hoisted on a forklift to get a closer view of the bullet holes, the streaks of Dzhokhar's blood and the so-called manifesto he scrawled, sources say the defendant sat under a canopy a short distance away, tugging on his chin hair. Ironically, the story of yesterday's testimony only seemed to reinforce the idea that it was Tamerlan, not his kid brother, who was ready and willing to enter paradise. He was the guy who ran straight toward Watertown Police Sgt. Jeffrey Pugliese firing until he ran out of bullets. And if his kid brother hadn't run him over with that carjacked Mercedes, who knows, maybe Tamerlan would have been denied the reward of jannutul Firdaus (inshallah) and those 72 virgins. Perhaps, after he had crawled into Slip Away II, maybe Dzhokhar thought he would go to sleep and ease into martyrdom. But when the opportunity presented itself for Dzhokhar to go out in blaze of infamy, he chose to hide deep down in the belly of the boat. He clearly wanted to stick around. One final note: Friends say that David Henneberry never went fishing on Slip Away II. He couldn't stand to have fish blood and guts stain the inside of his boat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Two 'aces' in holes already Masterson, Kelly shaky so far FORT MYERS - The past two days have not been good ones for the Five Aces. In fact, after Justin Masterson and Joe Kelly were finished the past two afternoons - which didn't take long by the way, in either case - the skeptical might suggest the Red Sox rotation looked like three aces and two jokers. Much has been made of the Sox' insistence on entering the season without a definable 'ace,' the classic alpha dog starting pitcher the rest of the staff looks up to and can rely on to slam the brakes on potential losing streaks and carry the day in the clutch. Early in spring training, manager John Farrell went so far as to postulate that he had five No. 1 starters, while pitching coach Juan Nieves argued that at any particular stretch during a long season someone can emerge for a few weeks to serve as an ace of the moment before returning to his true self. At that point, one would guess, the hope is someone else makes a short-term appearance at that position until a real ace shows up. It's a good theory, but as far as a plan, one has to wonder about it. Sounds like something Pete Carroll might conjure up with the ball on the goal line and seconds left in the Super Bowl. But I digress. To add insult to injury, literally, Masterson was lit up Sunday by the Phillies, allowing seven hits, including two homers, and six earned runs. Kelly came back yesterday and gave up the identical number of hits, including two doubles in the second inning, and three earned runs in 22/3 innings before having to leave with a trainer by his side because of a balky biceps. We all understand that baseball is a marathon not a sprint. It is a long process of preparation and performance before anything is really decided definitively, so one should never put too much stock in either a strong outing or back-to-back circumstances where two of the Five Aces come up short. Yet these last two days give one pause to wonder anew whether the Sox have Five Aces or, like the hamburger joint, five guys. Yesterday one of them, Kelly, struggled with a biceps that began to tighten like a vice, quickly preventing him from throwing anything but fastballs. That might have worked at times for Nolan Ryan or Pedro Martinez, but in general not much good happens at the major league level when all you can throw is the same pitch over and over again. 'Warming up earlier my arm had a little bit of biceps tightness,' Kelly said. 'As the game progressed, it got more than tight. Basically I could only throw my fastball. I didn't think it was a big deal but it began to affect how the ball came out of my hand. I couldn't spin the ball. I thought it would work itself out. It didn't. I was getting hit around.' Indeed he was. Meaningless as it is when one has thrown so few innings, there's no questioning the fact Kelly's ERA at the moment is 11.05 and Masterson's is a less than masterful 6.48. At this stage of the spring, those are just numbers. But if you have lingering doubts that this insistence on saying they have Five Aces when in fact they have none may come back to haunt them, the last 48 hours did nothing to ease your concerns. Farrell, of course, has no concerns, which is the beauty of the man. If he was a golf pro who just shot 81, he'd say he struck the ball well but just didn't score. That's his role and his personality. It's a gift. His cup is always half-full and trending toward overflowing. So when asked if he had any worries either about Kelly's health or the Five Aces' future after a 4-3 win over the Mets yesterday, Farrell made clear none of this has led him to take Ambien to get to sleep at night. 'There's a process to go through (to prepare starting pitchers for the season),' Farrell cautioned. 'You can't skip any steps. Getting up and down, building their pitch count. Guys aren't always going to feel 100 percent on given days. You fully expect pitchers will go through ebbs and flows of arm strength in spring training. Some of our starters are going through a dead-arm period.' Fair enough, but are the Sox dead without an ace is the larger question? Hard to know, but if you were sitting in JetBlue Park on a sunny Monday afternoon watching a real ace, the Mets' Matt Harvey, mow down the Sox' lineup, you certainly understood the difference between Five Guys and one ace. Harvey, who is coming back from Tommy John surgery, scattered three hits over four innings, striking out three and allowing no runs. He was overpowering much of the time, reminding a crowd of 10,024 mostly Sox supporters that there is something still missing here in Fort Myers this spring, and it's not snow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Report finds underinvestment in T a 'myth'  A new report by a conservative think tank is calling the MBTA's claims that systemwide failures this winter were caused by years of underinvestment a 'myth.' The Pioneer Institute argues that, as measured by both passenger miles traveled and vehicle hours in service, the T received the most capital funding of the nation's 10 largest transit systems between 1991 and 2013. Funding for T capital improvements like expansion and facilities upgrades was higher than systems in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and New Jersey. T spokesman Joe Pesaturo said, 'The challenges this winter have made it clear that the MBTA has obstacles to overcome. The MBTA will continue to work closely with Gov. (Charlie) Baker's office, which appointed an expert panel to assess the T's finances and operations.' Pesaturo also noted that the T is about $1.7 billion in debt for Big Dig-related spending, with annual debt service of about $140 million.  The Pioneer Institute countered that the federal government did not order the T to undertake projects like building a commuter line to the South Shore as a condition of its contribution to the Big Dig.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hub students make strong argument for debate teams  Charlestown High School junior and aspiring lawyer Mohammad Umar was so nervous at the start of his first debate tournament last year that his left leg was shaking. But Umar's nerves were put at ease after he won the first round debating Cuba's embargo. He gave coach James Soares a high-five and said: 'Sign me up for the next tournament. I love it.' Umar, 17, now a team captain, said debating has improved his writing, reading and public speaking skills.  'I feel like I am much, much more confident,' Umar said. Success stories like his are behind a massive plan to start debate teams at every public middle and high school in Boston. A Georgia State University study on Boston's debate program found that students who joined debate teams have higher grades, higher test scores and are more likely to take and pass AP tests than those not on debate teams, said Steve Stein, executive director of the Boston Debate League, a nonprofit that works with BPS to start debate teams, run tournaments and train teachers as debate coaches. The Debate League began about nine years ago with three Hub schools and is now in 28 middle and high schools. Over the next five to seven years, Stein said, the goal is to have a debate team in each of the city's 75 middle and high schools. The $2 million annual budget - heavily supported by corporate donations and foundations - is expected to triple.  'We'd love to see a day where thousands of students are graduating from BPS every year trained in debate,' said Stein, who said the program has helped students struggling the most, 'especially male students of color.' Over the past seven years, Stein said they've been 'intentionally recruiting' students who struggle with academics, those with behavioral problems and those who are learning English. They found that the students 'loved debate,' Stein said. Last year, a pilot program in Spanish was launched. The students debate serious public policy topics - this year it's ocean exploration and development. They practice after school and compete in six tournaments a year. At Charlestown High yesterday, Umar and Joshua Rosa, his debate partner and fellow captain, were gearing up for this week's Citi Foundation Championships. Joshua, a 17-year-old junior, said he was hooked after winning his first round in a debate tournament. His public speaking skills have improved and he wants to study pre-law or pre-med at NYU. 'In class, I'm more engaged and more involved in the discussions,' he said. Said coach Soares: 'It's such an amazing way to empower students.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No time to lose Bibi  With all the threats facing our closest ally in the Middle East, Israelis must pull the lever for Bibi one more time. The future of their country - and peace in the Middle East - depends on it. If Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu loses his re-election bid today, the winner is Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah and radical jihadists worldwide who hate Israel, the United States and every freedom Western civilization stands for. Yet despite Netanyahu's unwavering friendship and wise counsel to the United States, President Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will be cheering his defeat, as well as dozens of other misguided Democrats who boycotted Netanyahu's recent historic speech before Congress about Iran's nuclear threat. It's an utter travesty we had to receive that warning, and a much-needed explanation of the cataclysmic consequences that failed nuke talks would undoubtedly yield, from a foreign leader instead of from our own president. It's obvious Obama and Kerry are more interested in coming to an agreement with Iran that's a public relations 'win' for them first versus crafting a pact that actually keeps Israel and future generations safe from harm. Americans don't want our president to kick the nuclear can down the road.  Netanyahu explained in his speech that Iran already has nuclear capability that can reach America's shores. And we know there's no safe haven from our other enemies - such as ISIS - accessing and utilizing dirty bombs or warheads in the future. A new report says the Kurds are accusing ISIS fighters of using chemical weapons in their ongoing Holy War against humanity. Will the Islamic State turn down an opportunity to amplify its power and influence tenfold by getting a nuke in the future?  You can bet your last dollar the answer is no.  What we know for sure is that once Iran completes its nuclear program, it will trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, making America and the world a much less safe place.  All the more reason Israelis need to re-elect one of the finest leaders of the free world, Benjamin Netanyahu. He's an honest and fearless leader who shares our interests and has America's back.

"Datome fan club building up  A new Garden folk hero appears to have been born. Luigi Datome, a native of Sardinia who was perhaps the finest Italian player in Serie A before he went to Detroit to languish on the bench, reemerged as one of Brad Stevens' best shooters off the bench.  And, as the Garden crowd demonstrated yet again during the swingman's 10-point performance last night, there's no shortage of appreciation. 'I'm very surprised, but I think people are excited because it's somebody new,' Datome said after the Celtics' 108-89 win over Philadelphia. 'Brand new in this league, but, of course, the love from the fans is moving me on.' This is also the happiest Datome admittedly felt on an NBA roster. 'Last summer with the national team,' Datome replied when asked the last time he was this happy.  'I was thinking about it. I never had so many games in a row with real minutes, when the game counted. My goal when I came into the league was to show I belonged on this level, and coach Stevens gave me this opportunity. It's just fantastic.' Thomas a no-go As Stevens repeatedly said last night, nobody wants to get back on the basketball court more than Isaiah Thomas. If only the Celtics guard's bruised lower back agreed. Thomas got the bad news during a meeting with Celtics trainer Ed Lacerte yesterday morning. The pain in his back was still too intense to allow him to play last night, thus extending his absence to four straight games. And the time frame is worse.  The Celtics leave tomorrow for games in Oklahoma City and San Antonio, and Thomas will spend that time getting treatment here. 'He'll be reevaluated tomorrow, but right now I'd say it's unlikely he travels,' Stevens said before last night's game. 'He's still three games away, which is too bad. He really wants to play. To say he's antsy is an understatement.' No further tests have been deemed necessary for Thomas. 'Ed said it's as tough of a bruise as he's ever seen,' Stevens said. 'Nobody wants to play more than that kid. That's what I appreciate about him. He had himself convinced he would play the next day after he fell. Hopefully he gets better sooner rather than later. He's a tough kid. Nobody questions that. He's doing nothing running-wise, movement-wise. He started jogging on the treadmill. But he hasn't been able to push himself as much as he needed to.' College calling A source said that, if contacted, Celtics assistant Jay Larranaga will consider interviewing for the opening at George Mason, the program his dad Jim took to the 2006 Final Four. Larranaga is said to view it all with due diligence, as opposed to genuine interest, out of respect for his father's former program. 'He loves working for Brad (Stevens) and the Celtics,' said the source, indicating that it would take a very special situation - another NBA job - for Larranaga to leave the Celtics. A league source said that Larranaga, who interviewed for the 76ers job last season, can expect to be getting more calls from NBA teams. 'The reality is that I'd be surprised if Jay wants that job,' the source said. 'He's going to have chances at head NBA jobs. If he went to George Mason, that would hurt his chances.' Stevens said he certainly understands the interest. 'It would be smart to pursue him, but I don't know what his interests are,' he said. 'He's just a really good basketball guy. He's smart, he works really hard, he's positive. I've talked about our staff and how great they've been all year. Any of those guys would be good for opportunities like that. One thing I'm excited about is that I have a chance to work with those guys every day, because I learn more from them than they do from me.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BAKER DEFENDS JOKES 'If you can't poke fun at yourself, you're not getting it' Gov. Charlie Baker is standing by his MBTA skit at South Boston's St. Patrick's Day Breakfast - and doubled down last night at another holiday dinner in Lowell, where he mocked the transit agency's dysfunctional commuter rail line. 'It was an opportunity for all of us to sort of poke fun at ourselves, and let's face it, we all know it's been a long winter. The MBTA had some issues we worked pretty hard with them to fix,' Baker told the Herald last night. 'If you can't poke fun at yourself, you're not getting it.'  Baker drew some chuckles at the St. Patrick's Day fete in Lowell, when he joked that during the height of the storms he would be told a number of commuter rail engines were ready to go the next day - only to see that number shrink the following morning.  'I was like, what are these things, teenagers? 'I got up this morning, Dad looked at me kind of funny. I was out drinking last night. I'm sorry.' ... I wish I was kidding, but the simple truth is the main reason we had so much trouble with the commuter rail is because inside those big, brawny locomotives beats the heart of a 16-year-old,' Baker said.  'We've been doing everything we can to get them to grow up fast. We're told we have 50 of them ready to go tomorrow morning,' he said. 'As long as nobody has any exams - or nobody wants to celebrate St. Patrick's Day with their friends - we should be fine in the morning.'  Baker got mixed reviews Sunday when he appeared in a video with event emcee, state Sen. Linda Dorcena Forry, waiting for a late bus to take them to the breakfast. Departing T general manager Beverly Scott then pulls up behind the wheel and hopes out loud that there's 'absolutely no reason to put you in the back of the bus,' before telling the governor to 'buckle up.' Newly minted Attorney General Maura Healey also drew some heat for holding up several fake subpoenas at the Sunday breakfast, and jokingly telling lawmakers in the crowd, 'Some of you might be familiar with these. So laugh.' Santa Clara University Law School professor Margalynne Armstrong found the joke inappropriate for the state's top lawwoman. 'She needs to make sure she gives the office the respect it deserves. It's important to not treat her power lightly,' Armstrong said. 'The decent thing to do would be to apologize. And it should be a real apology.'  Healey noted she didn't catch any flak for the joke. 'No, not for that. For a bad performance, maybe. Not that part of the performance, no,' she told the Herald. 'Was I supposed to? It was a joke. It's a roast.' She also said the subpoenas were obvious props.  'They didn't have the right seal,' she said. 'Did you see them? They were like Crayola subpoenas.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pedro: Ace motivator Sox legend stresses 'attitude' with staff FORT MYERS - Gather 'round, wannabe Red Sox aces (we're talking to you, Clay Buchholz; look alive, Rick Porcello): Uncle Pedro has a story to tell. 'I got into Montreal (in 1994) and I had just come from being a reliever with the Dodgers,' Pedro Martinez was saying the other day. '(Manager) Felipe (Alou) called me into the office one day in spring training and he handed me a ball and said, 'Pedro, you're my No. 4 starter.' I'm like, 'Oh, really? Thank you so much for the opportunity.' And he goes, 'Don't worry about being No. 4, because after the first three guys pitch, you're the No. 1. You have to feel like a No. 1 every time you take the mound.' ' Now, surely Martinez knows that being a No. 1 starter is more than a state of mind. He didn't become the greatest pitcher of his generation, to say nothing of a first-ballot Hall of Famer, by virtue of having extreme self-confidence. The blazing fastball, knees-knocking curve, bat-slowing changeup (that might only be the nastiest pitch ever thrown) and the fearlessness to brush back any hitter undoubtedly had more to do with it. And after a week-long visit to fulfill his duties as a special instructor and assistant to general manager Ben Cherington, Martinez also must know the Red Sox lack a pitcher with real No. 1-starter bona fides. Jon Lester isn't walking through the clubhouse door. Neither is Philadelphia Phillies ace Cole Hamels, for whom the Sox made a trade offer that one MLB source recently labeled as 'poor.' It's difficult to imagine they won't eventually obtain such an alpha pitcher, especially with principal owner John Henry green-lighting a record payroll that will approach $200 million for luxury tax purposes. But in the meantime, it behooves everyone in the organization to help instill enough confidence in Buchholz, Porcello and the other starters that they believe any of them are capable of taking the lead. And that's the tune Martinez is singing. 'A guy like Hamels, like Lester, top-notch starters, they're welcome in any team,' Martinez said. 'But if they're not here, I would be saying, 'Hey, I'm capable. Hamels was once what I am today, so why not me?' That would be the question I would have. I think they have to walk around with that same attitude - why not me, or why not us? Why can't we all be aces?' So, Martinez loves the customized 'He's the ACE' T-shirts that Buchholz ordered and distributed to Porcello, Justin Masterson, Joe Kelly and lefty Wade Miley to wear around the clubhouse before games. It shows 'character,' he says, and demonstrates the attitude he believes the starters need to have. Of course, proven aces don't need T-shirts. When Mets right-hander Matt Harvey scaled the mound yesterday at JetBlue Park, everyone knew they were about to see one of the majors' best. The same went for Martinez in his 201 starts for the Sox from 1998-2004. 'Any one of these guys could be the stopper,' Martinez said. 'They were just never put in this spot. And this (Red Sox) team is no joke. This team is going to put up some runs. This team is going to produce for them.' Ironically, people were saying the same thing about the Red Sox 10 years ago, after Martinez left to sign with the Mets. With Curt Schilling injured, the 2005 Sox went through most of the season with an ace-less rotation that consisted of David Wells, Matt Clement, Tim Wakefield, Bronson Arroyo and Wade Miller, only one of whom (Wakefield) posted an ERA below the league average. That team won 95 games and made the playoffs on the back of an offense that scored 910 runs but got swept out of the playoffs by the Chicago White Sox' superior starters. Still, Martinez is bullish on the potential of this year's rotation. He's impressed by Kelly's talent, and noted that Masterson was the Cleveland Indians' best pitcher for much of the 2013 season. He believes Porcello is 'showing signs of someone that could become the ace of the team,' and described Buchholz as 'going about his work like he's got a purpose.' Maybe so. But is there an ace in the bunch? Here, again, we yield to Uncle Pedro. 'My advice to those guys: Feel like you're the ace every single time you take the mound,' Martinez said. 'They know what they need to do. I'm not concerned, to be honest.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"MO COWAN PARTNER IN MCCA HOTEL BID Ex-U.S. sen once served on convention center board Former U.S. Sen. William 'Mo' Cowan - a onetime board member of the state convention center authority - is an equity partner in an $800 million Seaport District hotel that's being proposed as part of the agency's controversial $1 billion expansion, the Herald has learned. Cowan, who also served as former Gov. Deval Patrick's chief of staff and chief legal counsel, and another former member of the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority's board, Dean Stratouly, both have ownership stakes in the Omni Hotel & Resorts-backed 'headquarters hotel' project. It is one of six bids to build a 1,000- to 1,200-room, $800 million hotel across from the convention center. Cowan was tapped by Patrick in February 2013 to replace John F. Kerry in the U.S. Senate until Edward J. Markey won the seat in a special election five months later.  Cowan told the Herald in an email he did not see any conflict being an equity partner in the hotel after serving on the board that will decide on his bid. 'I do not discuss my personal investment decisions,' said Cowan, now a lawyer at Mintz Levin, when asked how much money he has invested for his equity stake.  Cowan, who served on the board from February 2008 to November 2010, also confirmed he is friends with Greg Shell, husband of the panel's current chairwoman, Michelle A. Shell. Stratouly - who served on the MCCA board from February 1998 to June 2010, and chaired its building committee - also downplayed perceptions that his project might be looked on more favorably due to his longtime ties with the MCCA. 'I am not quite sure how it would be a conflict of interest given the amount of time that has lapsed for either me or Mo' since serving on the board, Stratouly said. 'The fact that I have spent time working on the convention center is widely known. And this is a new board that I don't have any relationship with. That board came in as we exited ... so I think enough time has lapsed that there is no holdover knowledge.' James Rooney, the MCCA's executive director, declined an interview request yesterday. But during a break at his board's expansion committee meeting Friday he denied any favoritism would be given to his two former board members. 'There is a process. I'm sure it will be a rigorous process that is devoid of who the players are,' Rooney said. 'It's a very rational process involving capacity to build a hotel, the design, the level of participation, and that is how they will be judged. I don't see that they have an upper hand at all. They will be tested just like the rest.' Neither Cowan or Stratouly have filed any conflict of interest disclosures with the State Ethics Commission or the MCCA.  State 'revolving door' laws permanently ban state 'employees,' including those who volunteer on boards, from becoming financially involved in projects they worked on while serving the state.  If the person did not directly work on the project but it fell under their official purview, there is a one-year cooling off period. Both Cowan and Stratouly have passed that period. The headquarters hotel is a '50-50 undertaking' between the MCCA and Massport, which owns the two vacant parcels bordering Summer and D streets where the hotel will be built. The MCCA said the first official action taken on the project came on June 20, 2013 - after both Cowan and Stratouly left - when both the MCCA and Massport boards approved a letter of intent to begin developing the hotel site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In close race, Netanyahu vows no Palestinian state  WASHINGTON - In last-minute campaigning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday said that if his party stays in power he will reject the creation of a Palestinian state, a pitch aimed at shoring up his support on the right in a hard-fought race.  'Whoever moves to establish a Palestinian state or intends to withdraw from territory is simply yielding territory for radical Islamic attacks against Israel,' Netanyahu told the Israeli news site NRG. When asked if that meant no Palestinian state, he replied, 'Indeed.' Netanyahu used the backdrop of Har Homa, a Jewish settlement built on West Bank land annexed to Jerusalem, to warn that under his opponents, the center-left Zionist Union alliance headed by Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni would cede the area and allow it to be turned into 'Hamastan,' a reference to the Islamist militant group Hamas. Netanyahu's statements seemed aimed to halt the seepage of Likud votes to other conservative parties. Netanyahu's main rival on the right, the pro-settlement Jewish Home party, opposes a Palestinian state. While Netanyahu had been seen just a few months ago as likely to win, the election today in Israel is now more about bread-and-butter issues than the strained negotiations over Iran's nuclear ambitions, election-watchers told the Herald. 'The major political questions candidates have had to address are the price of cottage cheese and the cost of housing,' said David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee.  Netanyahu's controversial address to the U.S. Congress and ongoing tensions with President Obama drew headlines here, but those issues barely registered in Israel, where Netanyahu's Likud Party is facing a strong challenge from the Zionist Union. Voters don't elect the prime minister directly, but if Netanyahu's party doesn't secure enough of the 120 seats in the Knesset, he could lose the post to Herzog - but that is one of several potential outcomes that could take days to emerge from this tight race and complex parliamentary system. The prospect of restarting stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, a top priority of U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, also played a minimal role. Palestinians won't be watching the results, because they expect little to change, said Diana Buttu, an analyst and former spokeswoman of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Negotiations Support Unit. Herald wire services contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Saunders respects roots of Crimson  Crimson guard Wesley Saunders claims to feel duty-bound by Harvard's traditions. His performance easily can be measured on a stat sheet, or by the many Ivy League accolades he's accumulated in his unprecedented run at the school. Saunders is a three-time All-Ivy League first-team All-Star and was last season's conference player of the year. But the 6-foot-5, 215-pound Los Angeles transplant needs to satisfy some unspecified obligations to coach Tommy Amaker and the Crimson players who've helped turn Harvard into a basketball dynasty. 'It's great for me, but at the same time I can't forget about how it came to be this way,' Saunders said. 'It all started with the players before us paving the way and coach Amaker really getting us to buy into his system.' Saunders will compete in his sixth NCAA tournament game when 13th-seeded Harvard (22-7) engages fourth-seeded North Carolina (24-11) in the second round of the West Regional on Thursday night at Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena in Florida. 'This has been great to see how everything has come together to get us to this point and time,' said Saunders. 'I have just been lucky enough to be here at the right time but honestly, it's about the players before and everybody before who laid the foundation of what we have achieved.'     Harvard has won 20 or more games in six straight seasons, captured a share of the Ivy League title in each of the past five years and will appear in its fourth straight NCAA tournament. The Crimson needed a dramatic 53-51 victory against archrival Yale in a one-game playoff on Saturday in Philadelphia to capture the Ivy League's automatic berth. The last Ivy League team to secure four straight trips to the Big Dance was Princeton (1989-92).  'We feel like we can compete with anybody and I think we've shown over the years we can be competitive with just about any team in the country,' Saunders said. 'We are looking forward to the opportunity to go out there again and just play and see what we are made of.' The Crimson have demonstrated they can respect the name on their opponents' jerseys without being intimidated. Harvard upset New Mexico in the second round in 2013 and laid a 61-57 beating on fourth-seeded Cincinnati last March. Harvard rallied from a 16-point deficit to put a scare into perennial Big Ten power Michigan State before bowing 80-73 to the Spartans. The confidence from last year's run can carry over against the Tar Heels. Harvard's projected starters are Saunders at off-guard, Siyani Chambers on the point with Agunwa Okolie on the wing and Steve Moundou-Missi and Zena Edosomwan underneath. 'I think a lot of time with us being in the Ivy League, we don't get the respect around the country that other teams and other leagues do,' Saunders said. 'So it's opportunities like this where we can measure ourselves against the bigger-name school and bigger-name conferences. We just want this great opportunity to compete, and we know Carolina is great team. They are big and fast, but they aren't bigger and faster than Michigan State.'

"No doubting Thomas wants to be in lineup  As Brad Stevens repeatedly said last night, nobody wants to get back on the basketball court more than Isaiah Thomas. If only the Celtics guard's bruised lower back agreed. Thomas received the bad news during a meeting with Celtics trainer Ed Lacerte yesterday morning. The pain in his back was still too intense to allow him to play last night against Philadelphia, thus extending his absence to four straight games. And the time frame is worse. The Celtics leave tomorrow for games in Oklahoma City and San Antonio, and Thomas will spend that time getting treatment here. 'He'll be reevaluated tomorrow, but right now I'd say it's unlikely he travels,' Stevens said before last night's 108-89 win against the 76ers. 'He's still three games away, which is too bad. He really wants to play. To say he's antsy is an understatement.' No further tests have been deemed necessary. 'Ed said it's as tough of a bruise as he's ever seen,' Stevens said. 'Nobody wants to play more than that kid. That's what I appreciate about him. He had himself convinced he would play the next day after he fell. Hopefully he gets better sooner rather than later. He's a tough kid. Nobody questions that. He's doing nothing running-wise, movement-wise. He started jogging on the treadmill. But he hasn't been able to push himself as much as he needed to.' College calling A source said that, if contacted, Celtics assistant Jay Larranaga will consider interviewing for the opening at George Mason, the program his dad Jim took to the 2006 Final Four. Larranaga is said to look on the matter with due diligence, as opposed to genuine interest, as well as respect for his father's former program. 'He loves working for Brad (Stevens) and the Celtics,' said the source, indicating that it would take a very special situation - another NBA job - for Larranaga to leave the Celtics.  A league source said that Larranaga, who interviewed for the 76ers job last season, can expect to be getting more calls from NBA teams. 'The reality is that I'd be surprised if Jay wants that job,' the source said. 'He's going to have chances at head NBA jobs. If he went to George Mason, that would hurt his chances.' Stevens said he certainly understands the interest. 'It would be smart to pursue him, but I don't know what his interests are,' he said. 'He's just a really good basketball guy. He's smart, he works really hard, he's positive. I've talked about our staff and how great they've been all year. Any of those guys would be good for opportunities like that. One thing I'm excited about is that I have a chance to work with those guys every day, because I learn more from them than they do from me.' Home or away The Celtics now have won nine of their past 10 home games.Though Stevens emphasized execution on the second night of back-to-backs, he doesn't feel the need to stress something similar about home or road performance. 'It's important to me, and I said at the lowest of points, that in here you represent yourself like a Boston sports team should and play the right way, with the right mindset, the right toughness,' he said. 'But I don't talk about home and the road other than that. But yeah, we'll happily ride the momentum of a home crowd. There's an expectation to play the right way here, and we expect that of ourselves. You make too big a deal of the road, and then you think you're going to get a better deal at home and that's not how it works. You make a big deal of home, and then you make the road out to be this unconquerable mountain. So you play 50-by-94 feet and try to play well.  'That's one thing I learned from my first coaches - don't make things bigger than they are.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Celts show off moves Dance to fifth win in a row Gino made an appearance last night. Brad Stevens knows the cause of his cameos is a truly rare thing. 'It's nice when you have a game where you're making every shot, but that's one of those nights, and one of those nights is called that for a reason,' he said recently. 'You're not going to have it very often.' But after starting the game with a four-game winning streak comprised of grind-style basketball, the Celtics were apparently due to put Gino's disco video up on the Jumbotron. They completed a season sweep of Philadelphia, all by double digits, with the 108-89 win, and never led by fewer than 16 points after the first quarter. The win briefly moved them into a tie with Indiana and Charlotte (which played last night) for the seventh playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings. All five starters cracked double figures, including a 20-point, 10-rebound double-double from Avery Bradley, and Gigi Datome and Jae Crowder each brought 10 points off the bench. The Celtics, after shooting as high as 70 percent in the first quarter, closed out shooting a clean 50 percent. Brandon Bass, who had lamented Saturday night at Indianapolis that he hasn't seen Gino for awhile, got his wish last night. Stepping into the old Kevin Garnett role, the Celtics forward put his arm around Gerald Wallace's shoulders and pointed up at the Jumbotron, dissecting the dance master's moves. The Celtics thus won their fifth straight game, and their seventh in the last eight. The C's started their fourth straight quarter with a burst, pushing out as far as a 25-point (95-70) lead before the Sixers resumed making shots. Though they eventually gave in to a stretch of sloppiness, the Celtics did enough to preserve the comfortable margin. Four straight points from Tyler Zeller (game-high 26 points), including a run at the rim off a high pick and roll, was good for a 103-82 Celtics lead with 2:57 left. Strong first halves have often been followed by flat third quarters this season, but not this time. The Celtics hit eight of their first 10 shots in the third, moved up by 23 points (75-52) on a Marcus Smart three-point play, and continued to simply have one of those nights. Zeller, who had a layup off a Bass feed during that stretch, popped out to the top of the circle to hit jumpers on back-to-back possessions for a 79-57 Celtics lead with 4:05 left. Bradley and Zeller each had 18 points at this point, and Smart became the fifth starter to crack double figures with a 3-pointer. Though the Sixers had finally struck a groove, too, with a 34-point third quarter, the Celtics were busy lighting up for a 32-point frame of their own. Though Philadelphia cut the Celtics' lead to 85-68 with 1:25 left, Crowder closed out the third with back-to-back hoops for an 89-68 Celtics lead. The Celtics, Saturday's high-quality win in Indianapolis tucked away, celebrated in the opening 12 minutes. They departed for the second with a whopping 38-18 lead after shooting 67 percent from the floor. Zeller and Bradley - the latter breaking out of a short slump - each had 10 points by the end of the quarter. Zeller was a perfect 4-for-4. Datome opened the second quarter with his second 3-pointer of the night, continuing to push the Celtics on to greater offensive things. By the time Bradley buried his third trey of the first half on the end of a 9-1 run, the Celtics led, 51-24. Evan Turner scored the Celtics' next six points, including a 15-foot turnaround for a 57-31 lead with 1:23 left. They led at the half, 57-34.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Video bust for Hub heist flick  'The Forger,' the John Travolta-Christopher Plummer art-heist flick that was filmed in Boston almost two years ago, is finally getting a release - and it's going straight to video! The film, about an aging art prodigy who has to steal a Monet from the Museum of Fine Arts and replace it with a forgery, will have an exclusive run on DirectTV starting March 26. Then it gets a limited theatrical release on April 24, and pops up on Video On Demand. 'The Forger' is the second flick with usually bankable stars to go direct to video this month. It follows 'Serena,' which stars two of the hottest names in Hollywood - Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper - down the on-demand route. And like 'Serena,' 'The Forger' languished unreleased for many months, and suffered from some less-than-enthusiastic reviews. The flick was filmed entirely in Boston in 2013 and a just-released trailer features shots of the Tobin Bridge, the MFA, a framed David Ortiz jersey and Travolta struggling with an on-again, off-again Boston accent. It debuted at last year's Toronto Film Festival and the critics were less than impressed. 'The opening shot in 'The Forger' is of a haggard John Travolta sitting in a prison cell, and the despair etched into his face suggests the actor might already be contemplating how wrong he is for this role,' said The Hollywood Reporter, which went on to call the flick 'a contrived thriller that wraps a gritty Boston milieu redolent of a Dennis Lehane story around a sentimental heart, with a high-stakes art heist that belongs in a more robustly plotted Hollywood studio picture.' Variety predicted that it would do weak business at the box office - which is the likely reason for the video release. 'Home-turf theatrical biz is likely to be flaccid,' said the show biz bible. 'Although cast names and genre elements will make this a viable, if uninspired, ancillary and minor theatrical item in most territories.' 'The Forger' was one of five high-profile projects to film in Massachusetts in 2013. 'American Hustle,' with the aforementioned Lawrence and Cooper; 'The Judge' with Robert Downey Jr.; 'The Equalizer' with Denzel Washington;and the HBO miniseries 'Olive Kitteridge' with Frances McDormand were all filmed around the same time as the Travolta flick, and all were released last year. 'The Forger' was one of the first films acquired by the newly formed Saban Films, which picked up domestic distribution rights it at the Toronto film fest for $2.5 million. The studio also bought 'Tracers,' starring 'Twilight' teenthrob Taylor Lautner, which also went direct to video.

"Back on stand, Weinstein accuser declares: 'He is my rapist'  Link to Image NEW YORK - A day after breaking down in tears under cross-examination, a key accuser at Harvey Weinstein's trial returned to a New York City courtroom on Tuesday and told jurors: ""I want the jury to know that he is my rapist."" The woman was back on the witness stand for a third and final day as Weinstein's lawyers finished an exhaustive review of friendly, sometimes flirtatious e-mails she sent the film producer after she says he raped her twice in 2013. FULL TEXT They also played a recording she made of herself telling a psychic in April 2014 that Weinstein ""had tried to cross boundaries in my life but I don't allow him to."" Weinstein's lawyers contend that evidence points to a consensual relationship and shows that the 34-year-old former actress was a manipulator who gritted her way through sexual encounters with Weinstein because she enjoyed the perks of knowing him. ""I know the history of my relationship with him,"" she pushed back. ""I know it was complicated and difficult. But that doesn't change the fact that he raped me."" Asked by Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno how many times they had consensual sex, the woman responded: ""I only remember intercourse the times that he raped me."" Cross-examination took up most of the woman's time on the witness stand. She finished direct testimony on Friday, and prosecutors decided not to ask her any additional questions once Rotunno was finished Tuesday afternoon. One reason the defense has focused so much attention on the woman is that her allegations Weinstein raped her at a Manhattan hotel in March 2013 are the basis for some of the most serious charges at issue in his trial. The woman has alleged Weinstein raped her again several months later at a Beverly Hills hotel, though she said she is not sure whether she will pursue charges there. The woman's return to the witness stand followed an emotional episode Monday, when she sobbed while reading an e-mail passage about being abused earlier in her life. It was part of an e-mail she sent a boyfriend in May 2014 explaining her relationship with Weinstein. The judge halted proceedings when she was unable to continue. The Associated Press typically does not publish the names of people alleging sexual assault unless they give their consent. The AP is withholding the name of the woman because it isn't clear whether she wishes to be identified publicly. Resuming questioning on Tuesday, Rotunno asked the woman about several times she saw Weinstein after the alleged rapes, including her acceptance of his invitation to a Oscars party in 2015 and her decision to meet him in 2016 in his room at the same Beverly Hills hotel where she alleges he previously raped her. After the 2016 hotel encounter, the woman e-mailed Weinstein saying, ""I feel so fabulous and beautiful. Thank you for everything."" She told jurors that Weinstein ""was being really nice to me"" at that time, but said she couldn't remember if they had sex on that occasion. Weinstein, now 67, was married at the time to fashion designer Georgina Chapman. At one point, Rotunno asked the woman why she would accept favors from ""your rapist."" That's when the woman turned to jurors and said: ""I want the jury to know that he is my rapist."" While dozens of women have accused Weinstein of sexual assault or harassment, he is on trial in New York for allegations involving just two episodes with two women: the woman testifying Tuesday and a former film and TV production assistant, Mimi Haleyi, who alleges he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. Weinstein's downfall energized the #MeToo movement. As big a factor as Tuesday's witness is in the case, the defense's painstaking cross-examination, coupled with her emotional reaction on Monday, could run the risk of alienating jurors and making her appear more sympathetic. Defense lawyer Brian McMonagle found himself navigating the same murky waters on the way to winning a mistrial because of a hung jury in Bill Cosby's first molestation trial in 2017. Cosby was later convicted. ""Of course a lawyer has to go in there and attack credibility and attack inconsistencies,"" said McMonagle, who's not involved in the Weinstein case. ""It's just how you do it. There's a way to do it without being despicable."" Earlier on Tuesday, jurors heard from another supporting witness: an actress who testified that she felt pressured into having an awkward three-way sexual encounter with Weinstein and the woman he's charged with raping. Emanuela Postacchini testified that in February 2013, Weinstein had her meet him and the rape accuser at a Los Angeles-area hotel, where he tried to persuade the women to have sex with him. Postacchini said during the encounter, Weinstein's accuser went into the bathroom and was ""crying in the fetal position on the ground.'' Postacchini said that while she personally didn't feel forced to do anything, ""the situation was forced.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Picassos in the garage? Artist's handyman is convicted of hiding stolen works  Link to Image LONDON - One September day in 2010, a man who said he was the former electrician of Pablo Picasso entered the Paris office of the Picasso estate, wheeling a suitcase filled with 271 of the Spaniard's works. The electrician, Pierre Le Guennec, had traveled from his home in southern France with his wife, Danielle. He said he wanted to authenticate 180 watercolor paintings, lithographs, and Cubist collages, as well as two notebooks with 91 drawings. FULL TEXT The treasure trove had been in their garage for almost 40 years, he said, gifts from Picasso decades earlier. Thus began a nearly 10-year saga in which a lawsuit claimed that the works were ""stolen goods""; police began an investigation; courts heard contradictory testimony; and multiple appeals and hearings took the defendants and Picasso's heirs all the way to France's top appeals court. It culminated this past week in a decision by a top French court confirming the convictions of Le Guennec and his wife for receiving and concealing stolen artwork. It was the third time they were found guilty, but Pierre and Danielle Le Guennec, 80 and 76, are not going to jail. The court handed the couple two-year suspended sentences. They were not present for the final verdict. Pierre Le Guennec said in a telephone interview Saturday that the couple had learned of the ruling through neighbors and a newspaper article. The couple have always denied stealing the artwork. He had been employed as an electrician and handyman in various homes of the artist in southern France in the early 1970s, fixing an oven and setting up an alarm system in at least one property, among other duties. His wife told The New York Times in 2010 that ""my husband was getting ready to leave"" one day when Picasso gave him ""a box."" The artist, she added, ""never explained anything."" Among the works are nine rare Cubist collages, a painting from Picasso's iconic Blue Period, watercolors, lithographs, and dozens of drawings in notebooks. They are estimated to be worth several dozens of millions of dollars, although no precise valuation has been done, according to Jean-Jacques Neuer, a lawyer for Picasso's son. They are now housed at the Banque de France. Le Guennec said that he went to the Paris office in 2010 because he had recently learned that he had cancer, and he wanted to secure the provenance of the artwork for his two children. The artist's son, Claude Ruiz-Picasso, and the administrator of the Picasso estate were startled and intrigued, Neuer told news media at the time. Gazing at the unsigned cache and realizing that it was from the famed Spanish artist, they quickly grew suspicious. Ruiz-Picasso knew that his father, a temperamental genius who died in 1973, had been an inveterate collector who gave away only artwork that he had recently made - and he would have signed them. ""If you go see the Picasso estate and tell them, 'These 271 works from Picasso fell from the ceiling,' or, 'I found them at a bric-a-brac market,' no one will believe you,"" Neuer said in a telephone interview Saturday. He said the court ruling this past week marked ""the end of a coverup."" The artwork that Le Guennec hauled in was estimated to have been painted between 1900 and 1932. Anne Baldassari, a former president of the Pablo Picasso Museum in Paris, said at the couple's first trial in 2015, ""The Picasso I know wouldn't let his artworks go. It would be like ripping up one's own skin."" Le Guennec later changed his story, claiming that Jacqueline Roque, Picasso's last wife, and not the artist himself, had given him the artwork. Le Guennec's wife added in the interview that the couple initially said that Picasso had given them the artwork at Roque's instructions. They also said that the works had sat untouched in their garage for more than four decades. But Neuer argued that because the works were in a greatly preserved state, they could not have been stored for so long in a garage in southern France, where they would probably have deteriorated. More contradictions followed, Neuer said. Le Guennec claimed to have cataloged all the artwork on his own. But Baldassari said that the descriptions and comparisons were of ""an academic level."" For one drawing, for example, Le Guennec had drawn a parallel with ""Harlequin,"" an oil painting by Picasso that is now at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But when Neuer asked Le Guennec at the couple's 2015 trial to name Picasso's most famous artwork at MoMA, the former electrician did not know what the New York museum was. He and his wife were convicted that year. A higher court upheld that verdict in 2016, but the ruling was later quashed by the Court of Cassation, France's highest court. The Le Guennecs cannot appeal the final verdict, which was handed down Tuesday by the Lyon Court of Appeal. Neuer speculated that art merchants, probably based in Switzerland, had used Pierre Le Guennec in the same way that traffickers would a drug mule. Le Guennec called such a scenario ""ridiculous.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"AP source: NBA, teams, union discuss shortening season  Link to Image Link to Image The NBA may be closer to a shorter season, a new postseason format and the in-season tournament Commissioner Adam Silver has long wanted as well. A person familiar with the negotiations said Saturday the NBA is working with the players' union and its teams on a plan to shorten the regular season, possibly to 78 games. They also are considering a change to the playoff seeding and the addition of a midyear tournament for all 30 clubs in time for the 2021-22 season. The tournament would likely be a way for teams to mitigate the loss of revenue from the shorter regular season and fewer home dates. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no update on the plan has been publicly given by the league. ESPN first reported the progression of the plan on Saturday. The proposal could be sent to the league's board of governors in April for discussion and possibly ratification. NBA broadcast partners ESPN and Turner Sports also are involved in the talks. ESPN also reported the proposal includes a plan to reseed the playoffs after early rounds, potentially creating an NBA Finals between teams from the same conference. The notion of adding a midseason tournament has been something Silver has batted around since at least 2016, drawing the parallel to how such events are customary in European soccer. ""It would need to be negotiated with the Players Association,"" Silver said this year. ""I've had very general discussions with (union executive director) Michele Roberts about the notion that these are the kinds of things we're looking at. I think she, of course, is supportive of looking at any ideas we have to build the business over time."" The same applies to having a play-in playoff round, which Silver has said he supports. That idea has even reached the proposal stage, reviewed by the league's competition committee and others. The possibility of changing the playoff seeding has been talked about for some time as well. But the drawback to any shortening of the schedule - and perhaps fewer home games - is a decrease in revenue, which everyone would want to avoid. That's where the tournament comes into play, especially since it would involve all teams. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and            https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Mike Pence makes unannounced visit to Iraq  BAGHDAD - Vice President Mike Pence made an unexpected visit to Iraq Saturday, arriving as protests aimed at toppling the Iraqi leadership and changing the political system continued to roil the country. FULL TEXT Pence made two stops: He landed with the permission of the Iraqi government at Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq's western desert, where many of the American troops are billeted while they train and assist the Iraqi forces fighting the remains of the Islamic State. He then flew to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Pence received a classified briefing at the air base, from where American Special Forces had launched the operation in Syria last month that led to the death of the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He then spoke by phone with Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mehdi but did not meet with him, according to Abdul-Mehdi's office. The US Embassy in Iraq declined to comment on Pence's visit. But Abdul-Mehdi's office said in a statement that the two men ""discussed the latest developments in Iraq and the Iraqi government efforts at reform in response to the demonstrators demands."" In Erbil, Pence met with two powerful Kurdish politicians who are cousins: Nechirvan Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan region, and Masrour Barzani, the prime minister. Pence and his wife, Karen, later served Thanksgiving lunch to approximately 150 troops, and the vice president then delivered remarks to about 200 troops. The vice president thanked the troops for their service. The United States has about 6,000 troops in Iraq. The trip came 11 months after President Trump made a similar unannounced visit to Al-Asad, just days after announcing that he was pulling American troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. It caused a major shake-up in the White House defense and foreign policy team. Trump's plans to meet with Abdul-Mehdi were canceled. The timing of the trip by Pence - the second-most-senior member of the American government - was significant. It underscored the United States' continued engagement in Iraq and was an implicit riposte to Iran, which has often tried to present itself to Iraqi leaders as a more consistent partner than the Americans. Iran has dispatched General Qasem Soleimani, leader of its Quds Force, the most elite arm of the Revolutionary Guard, to help the Iraqis plot a response. The visit also occurred as Iraqi government leaders have struggled to deal with the protests, which have galvanized many in the south of the country as well as in the capital, Baghdad. On Saturday, Iraqi officials said one person had been shot dead and dozens of others wounded as protests continued in the capital. Iran, which sees the uprising in Iraq as a threat that has encouraged a similar movement at home, has advocated a tough response. The United States has lobbied against that approach, encouraging Iraq to work with the nonviolent protesters, but has taken the same view as Iran toward the prime minister. Unlike Iran, the United States wants to see reforms made in the Iraqi system to root out corruption and create an electoral system that is less dominated by sectarian apolitical parties that tend to divide up the spoils and do little to represent the people. Less than 24 hours before Pence's arrival, a rocket was fired at Green Zone, the location of the US Embassy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Penn State's Clifford leaves Ohio State game with leg injury  Link to Image Link to Image COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford left the game against No. 2 Ohio State early in the third quarter after getting hit as he threw, and backup Will Levis finished for the ninth-ranked Nittany Lions. Clifford went down awkwardly, with his right leg getting caught underneath his body. He managed to complete a pass on the play but stayed down and came off the field walking gingerly but without assistance. Penn State coach James Franklin said Clifford could have come back in, but his mobility would have been limited. He chose to stick with Levis and the sophomore provided a spark with his legs - at least for a little while. Levis helped Penn State complete a 75-yard touchdown drive, capped by Journey Brown's 18-yard run, to make it Ohio State 21-7 with 8:19 left in the third quarter. A fumble by Ohio State on its next offensive play set up Penn State in the red zone, and Levis ran for a 1-yard score to make it 21-14 moments later. Another Ohio State fumble led to a Penn State field goal that cut the lead to 21-17, but that was a close as it got. With Levis, the Nittany Lions leaned heavy on the run, and eventually they couldn't make enough plays. Levis finished with 34 yards rushing on 19 carries that included five sacks. He was 6 for 11 for 57 yards passing and threw an interception in the fourth quarter that ended Penn State's last trip into Buckeyes' territory on the day. The Nittany Lions lost 28-17.

"Governor Charlie Baker says he doesn't need to ride the T. He's wrong.  ""I'm not a virtue signaler."" So said Governor Charlie Baker, batting back the notion that he should ride the MBTA from time to time. When Boston Public Radio host Jim Braude - prompted by last week's Spotlight series on our traffic woes - asked him about it on Thursday, Baker indicated plainly that he thinks hopping on the commuter rail near his home in Swampscott to get to work would be a purely symbolic, and empty, public gesture: virtue signaling. In an interview for the series, the Globe's Andrew Ryan asked Baker if he'd ridden the Tube on a recent trip to London, and Baker got prickly: ""I did. So what?"" he replied. FULL TEXT Baker, who appears to have taken the T only once in five years as governor, and the commuter rail not at all, told Braude he rode it plenty before he was sworn in. But that's not good enough. And it reflects a view of our transit woes that simply isn't expansive enough. ""Using the system your voters take every day is not virtue signaling, it's doing your homework,"" said Stacy Thompson, head of LivableStreets Alliance, a transportation advocacy group. Besides, isn't it kind of a governor's job to send virtuous signals from time to time? As the series vividly demonstrated, our soul-destroying traffic congestion is not like the weather - beyond our control, immutable. It is not the cruel act of some capricious God. We did this to ourselves. We've all made choices that ensure the car is still king. Baker and other leaders, including a majority of legislators, take cars to work each day. That insulates them from the daily indignities of the public transit system over which they preside. Corporations that have helped grow the region's economy (and traffic)            incentivize car commuting with perks like free or cheap parking. And, thanks to the fact that we now feel entitled to on-demand everything,            drivers are plowing through traffic more clogged by Uber and Lyft rides, and delivery drivers for Amazon, DoorDash, and umpteen other vendors. All of this before the scourge of self-driving cars is upon us. You don't change a car-first culture without considerable effort and, it must be said, some discomfort. Baker believes the answer to our traffic woes lies in improving the public transit system, making it so attractive that even the most inveterate car commuters will be coaxed away from the wheel. That is a big part of the solution. But it's not sufficient to make the T irresistible or (let's not get crazy here) less awful. We also have to make driving less attractive for those who have choices. Yet Baker and others have consistently resisted measures that would do that: congestion pricing, for example, which would make it more expensive to drive into the center of the city at certain times; raising the gas tax; charging residents for parking stickers; upping fees on ride-sharing services. Meanwhile, T fares have been raised twice since Baker took office in 2015. Why, it's almost as if the votes of drivers matter more to our politicians than those of other commuters. When Braude asked why Baker hadn't asked more of motorists, the governor responded, ""keep in mind that everybody in Massachusetts who never uses the T spends a billion dollars a year on it, or more."" But that kind of binary thinking - drivers vs. T-riders - is how we got into this mess in the first place. Having great public transit isn't just good for T riders. It's good for drivers, too, who enjoy less clogged roads if those who can take the T do so. And a better MBTA helps propel our entire economy, which benefits every resident -- even those who never set foot on a trolley. Raising costs for drivers isn't just about raising much-needed revenue to help fund transit: It's also about shifting behavior. Because the forces that keep drivers in their cars are formidable. To be fair, Baker does sometimes talk in terms of moving people, rather than cars, which is exactly the right way to look at it. And obviously, it's not practical for him to take the T every day, or even frequently. But his dismissiveness does signal something: that Baker, at heart, remains as mired in car culture as the rest of us.

"2nd arrest in disappearance of UFC fighter's stepdaughter  Link to Image AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - Auburn police have arrested a second man in the disappearance of a UFC heavyweight fighter's stepdaughter. Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes told The Associated Press by email Saturday that 35-year-old Antwain Shamar Fisher of Montgomery has been charged with first-degree kidnapping in the disappearance last month of 19-year-old Aniah Blanchard. Fisher was arrested Friday and booked Saturday into the Lee County Jail, Hughes told the Opelika-Auburn News and WRBL-TV. Blanchard, whose stepfather is UFC participant Walt Harris of metro Birmingham, was last seen Oct. 23 at a convenience store in Auburn. Her black Honda CRV was found abandoned more than 50 miles (90 kilometers) away at an apartment complex in Montgomery, Alabama. Auburn police Detective Josh Mixon said Blanchard's blood was found in the car, and it appeared she had suffered a life-threatening injury. Mixon testified that convenience store video footage showed a man buying a beverage look over at Blanchard. He said tipsters later identified the man as Ibraheem Yazeed, 29, and a man at the store told investigators he saw Yazeed force Blanchard into her car and drive away. Prosecutors told a Lee County judge that a male's DNA was found in Blanchard's car, and the judge ordered Yazeed on Wednesday to submit a DNA sample. Lee County District Judge Russell Bush denied bond for Yazeed, who also is charged with kidnapping.

"Jones, No. 5 Alabama rout Western Carolina, 66-3 without Tua  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) - Tua Tagovailoa watched from a cart as his Alabama teammates treated him to a dominant performance against a badly outclassed opponent. Mac Jones passed for 275 yards and three touchdowns in little more than a half and No. 5 Alabama began life without Tagovailoa with a 66-3 romp Saturday over Western Carolina of the Football Championship Subdivision. With Tagovailoa watching much of the game from behind the bench, the Crimson Tide (10-1) put on a one-sided show against the Catamounts (3-9). The star quarterback, who had hip surgery on Monday, was cheered as he was driven toward the sideline before the game. He didn't have to give much of a pep talk. ""Just his presence,"" Tide wide receiver Jaylen Waddle said. ""Just knowing what he meant to the team. That was enough. He didn't have to say much."" Alabama is fifth in the College Football Playoff rankings and hoping to somehow make the field despite failing to win the SEC West - and losing its biggest star. But this one was about taking care of business after an emotional week, not impressing the selection committee. ""It's not easy to overcome something like that, losing a great leader,"" said Jones, who completed 10 of 12 passes in his second career start. ""But I think we're built for that. We train every day for the whole year mentally and physically. It's really mental toughness and learning how to rebound and respond to adversity."" Alabama forced five turnovers, including Xavier McKinney's 81-yard interception return for a touchdown, and got big plays from Jones and wide receivers DeVonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle. Jones only threw one pass after halftime. Smith had four catches for 94 yards and two touchdowns, including a 57-yarder when he juked a defender before sprinting to the end zone. Waddle produced 101 yards and took a screen 54 yards for a touchdown, then returned a punt 49 yards to near the goal line on his next touch. ""I thought he threw the ball well and he was accurate on the deep ball,"" Alabama coach Nick Saban said of Jones. ""I know he missed one, but we just want to keep building on his confidence and our confidence in him that he's going to go out there and do his job well."" THE TAKEAWAY Western Carolina fell to 0-57 against FBS teams. The Catamounts came up empty after making it into Tide territory on each of their first four drives, including three turnovers. ""We had five turnovers on the day, and you can't do that against anybody, but especially the University of Alabama,"" Catamounts coach Mark Speir said. ""I wish them the best of luck in their quest for the playoffs."" Alabama did what it was supposed to and showed no signs of an emotional hangover after Tagovailoa's injury. The defense had some shaky moments but was missing several players nursing injuries, including linemen Raekwon Davis and D.J. Dale. Najee Harris ran for a touchdown and caught a scoring pass. TAULIA'S TURN Tagovailoa's absence gave his younger brother, Taulia, a chance for his most extended action. The freshman came into the game with 12:12 left in the third quarter and threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Smith on his first attempt. He completed 2 of 3 passes for 35 yards. Alabama scrapped plans to redshirt the four-star recruit, who already had played in four games. Fellow freshman quarterback Paul Tyson, great-grandson of coaching icon Bear Bryant, saw his first action. CARE TO DANCE? When Saban recruited safety Jared Mayden, he took part in a dancing contest. Mayden's mother, Katrina Salles, reminded him of that during the pre-game ceremony honoring the seniors on the field. ""She reminded me of that today and actually said, 'Do you want to dance?' I said, 'Not today,"" said Saban, laughing. PICKS IN PAIRS McKinney ended Western Carolina's first two drives with interceptions, including the pick-six, after coming in with just one. Mayden got his third and fourth interceptions. UP NEXT Western Carolina finished its regular season and must replace senior quarterback Adams. Alabama ends the regular season at No. 16 Auburn in its final chance to make a statement for the playoffs. ___ More AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and            http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Breaking down Tom Brady's 'bad' season  Link to Image Welcome to Tom Brady's terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year. This is not how the iconic quarterback envisioned his 20th season going. He's on a short contract, short of weapons, and short on patience for an offense that's just trying to stay out of the way instead of marching into the end zone. Instead of basking in the warm glow of a 9-1 start, Brady has been enveloped by a black hole of disappointment, culminating in last Sunday's perturbed presser following an anemic 17-10 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. The Patriots' lone touchdown came not from Brady's gilded arm but from Julian Edelman's - another indignity in a season that hasn't gone Brady's way. When you're used to the football universe bending to your will and your six Super Bowl rings it can be challenging to accept the alternative. Brady is 10 games into the season with an offense that isn't showing improvement. Rather, it seems to be regressing, failing to generate more than 20 points on its side of the ball in its last three games and generating fewer than 343 total yards in four straight games. FULL TEXT On pace for his fewest TD passes in a full season as a starter, Brady has been relegated to the role of caretaker QB on a team riding a dominant defense. It might not get any easier on Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys with wide receivers Mohamed Sanu (ankle) and Phillip Dorsett (concussion) missing practice time and uncertain for the game. The good news is left tackle Isaiah Wynn should return to restore security to Brady's blindside. Still, at an age, 42, when Brady needs more assistance to play at an elite level - whether he'll admit it or not - he's getting less. The frustration of the GOAT is visible and palpable. ""I think the frustration that they see is that Tom knows what he has and what he doesn't have,"" said a source close to Brady. Brady is also reeling from the revolving door at wide receiver. He envisioned a receiving corps with Demaryius Thomas, Josh Gordon, and Antonio Brown. That never actually materialized. Thomas was traded to the Jets to make room for Brown. But now all three wideouts have run out routes from Foxborough, leaving Brady with an emptier nest than anticipated. The team acquired Sanu, but he's still trying to assimilate. Having Brown for one game was like getting a bite of Kobe beef and then having it yanked away and replaced with ground chuck named Jakobi Meyers and N'Keal Harry. It's tough for TBQB to swallow. To recap Brady's season of discontent: Aug. 5 - Brady discussed the revamped contract he received, which added $8 million to his 2019 salary but not any additional years: ""It is what it is. That's a good line. Whoever said it, it's very pertinent. Like I said, there's a lot of guys who have one year left on their contract. I've got one year to go, and we'll see what happens."" Sept. 20 - The Patriots release Brown after 11 tumultuous days, multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, and threatening text messages to one of his accusers. Sept. 29 - After a 16-10 win over the Buffalo Bills in which Brady threw the most passes in his career without reaching 200 yards or tossing a touchdown, going 18 for 39 for 150 yards and an interception, he is noticeably dejected. He opens his postgame presser with a sarcastic remark about ""that riveting performance."" Oct. 4 - Brady is asked about young players traditionally having a difficult time acclimating to the offense. He hardly offers a ringing endorsement. ""Like I said, I've got to do the best that I can do,"" said Brady. ""So, yeah, those guys are trying. They're young. I was young; I was trying once, too. I just didn't have to play my first year, so it's a little different."" Oct. 8 - Brady is asked in the wake of tight end Benjamin Watson's release - Watson would return to the team on Oct. 15 - about relying on tight ends Ryan Izzo and Matt LaCosse. ""I'm the quarterback, so I don't make those decisions,"" he said. ""Whoever is out there, that's who I've got to play with."" Oct. 19 -- Brady is hounded with questions about a cameo he had on the Netflix show ""Living with Yourself"" starring Paul Rudd. Some interpret Brady's scene coming out of a strip-mall spa that's central to the cloning premise of the show as trolling Patriots owner Robert Kraft. The Patriots patriarch was caught up in a sting operation at a seedy South Florida day spa and charged with two counts of misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution. ""That's not what that was about,"" Brady said. ""I think that was taken out of context, just like you're taking it out of context and trying to make a story for yourself which has a negative connotation to it, which I don't appreciate."" Nov. 17 - An irked Brady gives a truncated press conference in Philadelphia where he is visibly agitated by the state of the offense, which punted on eight of 13 possessions. If Brady has been striking more sour notes than usual this season, it echoes the unit he leads. The Patriots rank 16th out of 32 teams in yards per game (359.9). They sit 17th in third-down conversions (38.8 percent). They're 30th in rushing yards per attempt at 3.31 and 25th in red-zone touchdown percentage 48.8 percent, the latter two areas the team has struggled in all season. It's that lack of improvement, not a lack of statistics, that bugs Brady. He has proven time and time again he'll do whatever it takes to win, whether that's handing it off or airing it out. He was happy to do the former last season when the offense found its identity as a run-to-pass attack. But the inefficiency and constrictions of the offense are grating for the GOAT. The Patriots struggle to throw the ball consistently outside the numbers, allowing defenses to make the middle of the field claustrophobic. Harry can help there, but the rookie has to secure Brady's trust, and the football in practice, first. Forced to resort to game manager mode, Brady has faced unappetizing choices. He can either hold the ball and risk sacks or throw it away, damage his passer rating, and live to fight another play. According to pro-football-reference.com, Brady leads the NFL in throwaways with 26. Brady also leads the NFL in intentional grounding penalties with four. It's natural to ask if part of the offense's struggles have to do with slippage in Brady's game. The NFL average passer rating is 91.5 for 2019. Brady is at 90.1. But he's still throwing the ball with zip and placing it where he wants to, mostly. His play is a symptom of the offense's infirmity, not the cause. Brady's 2019 mien is incongruous with his career. But he still loves the game and winning above all else. However, it has been a trying year, and it's trying his patience. Christopher L. Gasper is a Globe columnist.

"Morgan's 4 TD passes lead No. 11 Gophers past Wildcats 38-22  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) - Tanner Morgan led No. 11 Minnesota to scores on its first three possessions and finished with four touchdown passes, and the Gophers bounced back from their first loss of the season with a 38-22 win over Northwestern on Saturday. The Gophers (10-1, 7-1 Big Ten, No. 10 CFP), who lost at Iowa last week, clinched a share of the West Division title and clinched their sixth season with 10 or more wins. ""The word of the week was respond,"" Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck said. ""We needed to and they responded. That was a clear message from the beginning, that we had to start fast. ""That's what championship football looks like - come out of the gate and put 21 points on the board like that."" Morgan, the Big Ten's leading passer, came out firing following a week in the concussion protocol after absorbing back-to-back sacks by the Hawkeyes. The redshirt sophomore, listed as questionable until Saturday morning, has thrown 26 touchdowns this season to set a school record. ""We knew we had to come out fast, come out firing,"" Morgan said. ""We always talk about starting fast, accelerating in the middle and finishing strong."" Fleck said Morgan was almost his old self, despite an abbreviated week of practice. ""Got to give him credit with the limited amount of reps he had to be able to play like he did,"" Fleck said. ""There were some things he was just a little off on today."" Morgan threw three TD passes to Rashod Bateman and one to Tyler Johnson against Northwestern (2-9, 0-8). Bateman finished with 78 receiving yards and Johnson had 125, giving Minnesota its first pair of 1,000-yard receivers in season. Rodney Smith finished with 77 rushing yards to give him 1,063 for the season. Morgan zipped a 19-yard TD pass to Bateman in the corner of the end zone to end a 10-play, 56-yard drive on Minnesota's first possession. After Shannon Brooks ran in from 9 yards, Morgan hit Bateman for a 10-yard TD and 21-0 lead. Bateman's other TD catch was a 7-yarder in the third quarter. With quarterback Aidan Smith sidelined (hand), Northwestern turned to Hunter Johnson, who hadn't started since the season opener. Andrew Marty entered early in the second quarter after Johnson went 0 for 2 and was sacked three times. Marty threw a TD pass to Jace James and ran for two scores. ""(Johnson) was the most healthy quarterback we had to start the game who had experience,"" Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said. ""When Hunter went down, it was Andrew's opportunity. ""He was pretty efficient, I'm just happy for him."" Joe Gaziano sacked Morgan for a safety early in the second quarter to get Northwestern on the board. Gaziano added another sack to give him 29 for his career, a school record. LUCKY 7? Minnesota has seven wins in Big Ten play for the first time, TAKEAWAY Minnesota: Morgan seems primed to lead Minnesota into the postseason. His third touchdown pass in the game eclipsed Adam Weber's season mark of 24 set in 2007. The Gophers have their first 10-plus win season since 2003. Minnesota's previous four seasons with 10 wins or more were in 1900, 1903, 1904 and 1905. This is Minnesota's first 10-win year in regular-season play since 1905. Northwestern: Since the Big Ten started playing a championship game in 2011, no team until 2019 Northwestern finished last in its division after playing in the title game the previous year. The Wildcats are in danger of going winless in conference play for the first time since the 1998 team went 0-8 in Gary Barnett's final season.

"New Hampshire may test durability of Sanders' popularity  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image FRANKLIN, N.H. (AP) - Bernie Sanders has consistently remained among the front-runners in the Democratic primary with polling that has stayed strong despite his campaign-trail heart attack last month and the rise of top rivals Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg. But perhaps no state will test the Vermont senator's durability more than New Hampshire, where he trounced Hillary Clinton by 22 points in 2016 and now may find himself a victim of that success since repeating such a dominate performance seems unthinkable. Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, is trying to erode Sanders' support among ardent progressives, while former Vice President Joe Biden continues to woo the Democratic establishment, declaring during a recent stop in the state capital, Concord: ""I plan on winning New Hampshire."" Yet another New Englander, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, could raise the state's stakes since he's already relatively well known here, despite  just joining the race. And, with none of those candidates from nearby states running away with New Hampshire, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has moved among the front-runners - similar to his rise in Iowa. ""I like what Bernie stands for,"" said Jessica Pine, 42, who attended a Sanders event Saturday in Franklin and is considering voting for him, Warren or Biden. ""I'm not sure about the electability for him."" Polls in late October and early November show Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg all bunched together for the New Hampshire lead, with each seeing about the same level of support from likely primary voters. Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in August he expected Sanders to win New Hampshire - which is expected to hold its primary on Feb. 11, eight days after Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses - while insisting that falling short wouldn't spell catastrophe. ""It gets harder if we don't win New Hampshire for sure,"" Shakir said. Still, in September, Sanders ousted his New Hampshire state director, and a top adviser to the campaign in the state also left. On Oct. 1, Sanders had a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada. Since then, the Sanders campaign has shown more of a New Hampshire presence and announced earlier this month that it had 90 staffers here. Warren has more than 55 staffers statewide, according to a campaign aide. And, though voters at their respective events often name Sanders or Warren as among their top choices, the senators' campaign styles are far different. Warren prides herself on the number of ""selfies"" she takes with attendees, with lines snaking throughout venues well after she's finished speaking. Sanders sometimes moves on quickly enough that staffers begin breaking down the site moments after his event concludes - though he held a photo line of his own in Franklin on Saturday. Warren takes questions from the audience via a lottery system. Sanders - when he does opt to take questions - is likely to pepper crowds with more questions even as he provides answers. Sarah Gellert, a 40-year-old teacher, said she voted for Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary but now is undecided between him and Warren. ""I feel for both candidates very deeply and I would love - of course in this la la land world - I'd love to see them on the same ticket,"" Gellert said. ""I'm really scared for them because they have so much overlap in terms of their voter pool."" As he has elsewhere, Buttigieg has relied on his New Hampshire popularity rising even while still introducing himself to many voters and building out campaign infrastructure. Patrick makes the field even more crowded, but potentially helping to ease some of the logjam is California Sen. Kamala Harris, who spent weeks attracting large New Hampshire crowds only to recently close down her operations here to focus on Iowa. In Franklin, 75-year-old Sanders supporter Lana Kangas asked the senator if in the future he would take more time to show the differences between himself and the other candidates, including Warren. Sanders noted his age, 78 compared to Warren's 70, experience and consistency, but answered, ""I will say without hesitancy that every single Democratic candidate on his or her worst day will be 10 times better"" than President Donald Trump. After waiting to get her photo taken with Sanders, Kangas said she's worried the other Democrats couldn't beat Trump. ""I believe that Bernie is the only one that can galvanize the people, that will rally the people,"" Kangas said. ""Sen. Warren, I believe, will end up like (former President Barack) Obama. He said all the right things, he was for change, he was going to galvanize people to fight for change and when he came into office, he didn't. It was like the whole thing got dropped.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Harvard-Yale game delayed at halftime by student protest  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Protesters wearing the colors of both Harvard and Yale staged a sit-in at midfield of Yale Bowl during halftime of the 136th edition of the annual football rivalry known as The Game. Most left after about an hour when they were escorted off by police; about two dozen who remained were told by police they were under arrest. A few dozen protesters initially trickled onto the field as the Yale band finished performing its halftime routine. They held up banners asking the schools' presidents to divest from the fossil fuel industry, while other signs raised issues of Puerto Rican debt and the treatment of the Uighurs. Largely of college age but with a few older protesters mixed in, the group chanted: ""Hey Hey! Ho Ho! Fossil fuels have got to go!"" One banner read ""This is an emergency."" In a statement distributed to reporters in the press box during the fourth quarter, Yale said it ""stands firmly for the right to free expression."" ""While I respect the rights of Harvard and Yale students to protest, their efforts should not impact their fellow students' ability to pursue their passions as athletes on the field of play, and those who support them,"" Yale athletic director Vicky Chun said. ""We are proud of our student-athletes and coaches for their resilience today in an extremely difficult situation."" Police in yellow vests lined up alongside the sit-in but did not intervene. When the 15-minute halftime expired and the protest continued, hundreds more fans streamed onto the field to join in. Fans remaining in the stands began to boo, but only briefly. Players tried to remain warm on the sideline in the mid-40 temperatures, but then returned to their locker rooms. Harvard coach Tim Murphy was given an update from the game officials and public safety officers as the protest continued. The public address announcer implored the group to leave, repeating, ""As a courtesy to both teams, the game must resume."" Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins spoke to the protesters over a megaphone, trying to convince them that they had made their point, but it would be lost if the situation escalated. After about an hour, police formed a line and moved forward, from the Yale sideline toward the Harvard sideline. A protest leader encouraged all ""internationals"" to leave. An agreement was reached to escort the remainders off, with one police officer to every two protesters. Those who did not leave then were informed by Higgins that they would be arrested. Asked how many people were taken into custody, Higgins referred questions to the police public information officer. Messages left with Yale and New Haven police were not immediately returned. Between 20 and 30 protesters were arrested, according to organizers of the event. Rachel Sadoff, a junior at Harvard, said about 150 students from the two universities planned to participate in the protest. She said about 100 more students who had been sitting in the stands joined in. ""Our goal was to spread the word,"" Sadoff said. ""If more people speak up, our colleges will have to listen."" She said those arrested were released and given a court date. With Yale hoping to clinch an Ivy League title, Harvard led 15-3 at halftime and opened a 29-19 lead after three quarters. The Crimson led 36-22 with about seven minutes left in the game, and most of the 44,989 in the announced crowd had left. Yale rallied with two touchdowns in the final 88 seconds to force overtime in the game, which started at noon and was still going when the sun set in New Haven at 4:26 p.m. The Yale Bowl does not have lights. ___ More AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and            http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cathy Long dies; won husband's US House seat after his death  Link to Image Cathy Long, a Louisiana Democrat who won her husband's U.S. House seat after his sudden death in 1985 and served one term, has died. She was 95. She died Saturday in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The cause was dementia, her family said. Long beat three competitors with 56% of the vote in 1985, with a 2-1 margin over the second-place finisher for the seat held for a total of 16 years by Gillis Long. The district covered 15 central Louisiana parishes, including Baton Rouge, the state capital. ""It was a challenging time. She had two weeks to decide whether or not to run for his seat,"" her son George Long, who was 30 at the time, said in a phone interview Saturday. ""Our dad had just died, and people were giving her campaign contributions,"" said his sister, Janis Long. She said U.S. Rep. Lindy Boggs, D-La, who had won her husband's seat after his plane disappeared in Alaska in 1972, encouraged Cathy Long to run. Gillis Long was first elected to Congress in 1962 and then lost in the next election before being voted back into office in 1972, holding the seat for seven straight terms. Cathy Long already had experience in politics, working early on for a U.S. senator from Oregon and a U.S. representative from Ohio, and later campaigning and giving speeches for her husband, as well as advising him. ""I don't have to start from scratch. I already know how Congress works,"" she told The Associated Press in 1985. George Long described her as one of the last moderates elected from the area. ""I was glad she decided not to run for re-election,"" he said. ""The tide was turning."" Mary Catherine Small was born in Dayton, Ohio. She joined the Navy at age 20 during World War II, serving at a Navy hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas. The Longs met at Louisiana State University, where both enrolled after the war. They married in 1947. George Long noted that one of their mother's early campaign experiences was riding around the state with former Gov. Earl K. Long - her husband's cousin - while he was running for Congress. Earl Long won a Democratic primary runoff and was preparing to run unopposed in the general election when he died in 1960. His death prompted Gillis Long to move the family back to Louisiana to establish residency so he could run for the seat in 1962, George Long said. Cathy Long also campaigned for the Equal Rights Amendment, her children said. The siblings recalled their mother as an adventurous spirit who loved scuba diving, fishing trips and even tried parasailing when she was about 60. She also was a giving person who worked in the 1960s to promote the Special Olympics and more recently fed homeless people and tutored reading at a Washington, D.C., neighborhood organization called Miriam's Kitchen, they said. Janis Long said her mother asked for 90th birthday gifts of donations to Miriam's Kitchen, which received about $12,000. The family said in their obituary that they plan to ""cast ashes into the Potomac River on Easter, in the Mississippi River on Mardi Gras, and in the Caribbean Sea near San Pedro, Belize where she loved to fish and scuba dive.""

"Holliston tops Winchester to win first championship  Link to Image WORCESTER - The Holliston girls' soccer team controlled play for the majority of Saturday's MIAA Division 2 final at Worcester State. But a second-half goal by Maggie Fitzgerald was the difference. The senior forward scored in the 63rd minute for a two-goal cushion and the Panthers held on to defeat defending champion Winchester, 3-2, at Worcester State, for the program's first championship, the capper to a 19-0-3 season. FULL TEXT It was fitting that Fitzgerald netted the winner. After playing on the junior varsity as a freshman, and playing in just a couple of varsity games in the past two seasons, she was voted a captain this year for ""how she puts the team first, and what a great leader she is,"" said Holliston coach Brielle Chadsey. With the expanded role and playing time, Fitzgerald's four years of commitment to the team paid off with a 10-goal season and a championship medal. ""To come out as a captain my senior year and be a contributor to the team is amazing because I feel like I proved myself,"" Fitzgerald said. ""I can put my soccer career aside and show that I could have done it any year."" Holliston opened the scoring in the 15th minute when junior forward Megan Putvinski beat the Winchester defense down the right flank. The Panthers took a commanding 2-0 lead to halftime thanks to a shot from in close by sophomore midfielder Mia Luisi. Winchester (17-2-3) pushed back in the second half, though, with junior Ally Murphy scoring in the first 10 minutes on a header. Fitzgerald made her mark in the 63rd minute. After a header by Putvinski bounced off the post, she was in the right spot to knock it in with her left foot. ""I just stuck my leg out and sometimes that's all you have to do,"" Fitzgerald said. ""It's not all that power, I just tapped it right in and there it was."" Chadsey singled out junior goalkeeper Mary Katherine Ward, the MVP of the Tri-Valley League, as a key to the victory. ""She gives us so much confidence back there,"" Chadsey said. ""We've only let in nine goals before today, she's been excellent for us.""

"Who needs canvas? In Dakar, street artists express their visions on sides of homes  Link to Image DAKAR, Senegal - On one wall, the painting of a marabout, a Muslim holy man, peers out from behind a line hung with laundry. Nearby, a poster of an African woman in a bustle has been pasted to a house. Still further along, women socialize in front of a wall covered in an intricate black-and-white abstract pattern. These are the painted houses of the Médina, a poor and working-class neighborhood near downtown Dakar. The neighborhood has welcomed street artists from all over the world to practice their craft in what the founder of the project calls the open sky museum. Dozens of wall paintings dot the neighborhood, bringing color to usually drab cement walls and adding to the flourishing international art scene in Dakar. FULL TEXT Artists from not just Senegal but Burkina Faso, Algeria, Morocco, Congo, France, and Italy have come to paint on these walls. They in turn have brought art lovers and tourists into a neighborhood where they otherwise might not go, to mingle with people they otherwise might not meet. The wall art of the Médina ""can bring together people who normally don't even see each other,"" said Mauro Petroni, a ceramist who has lived in Dakar for many years. Street art seems to come naturally to Senegal, where many small shops are adorned with images of what they sell. Paintings of scissors signify tailors; heads with fancy hairstyles advertise barbers; images of cows and bowls of milk herald the ubiquitous sweet milk shops; a drawing of a sheep broadcasts the presence of a vendor serving grilled meat. Shop art is commissioned by shop owners and sometimes painted by them, too. But to paint on a house in the Médina neighborhood, it helps to go through Mamadou Boye Diallo, known as Modboye. Diallo, 31, was born and raised in the Médina, the son of an elevator operator. He dropped out of school at 15 to become a break dancer and rollerblader. He got to know the art scene by working as a messenger, delivering fliers on roller blades for art galleries. In 2010, he created Yataal Art, a nonprofit arts collective, and painted the first wall in the Médina with friends. The beauty of it is that ""you don't have to take a nice shower and wear perfume"" to see the art, Diallo said. Among street artists seeking a wall to paint on, Diallo became the man to see. ""You have to pass by him in order to work in the Médina,"" said one of the street artists, Doline Legrand Diop. ""He functions a bit like a curator."" Legrand Diop lived in Dakar for many years and has two children with a Senegalese man, though she now lives in France. Her pictures of black people dressed as aristocrats, her #remakehistory project, can be seen on the walls of the Médina. In the beginning, it was not always easy to convince homeowners to let people paint on their walls. ""They wanted money,"" Diallo said. But as the project caught on, they wanted to keep up with their neighbors. ""It's for the community,"" said Tonton Kaba, a retired chauffeur who has a Legrand Diop collage on his house. Abdoulaye Camara, known as Père Djim, allowed an artist to paint the word ""suba,"" Wolof for tomorrow, on his house. He makes furniture of wood and animal horns on the street in the Médina, home to many artisans, so he could relate. Still, what residents expect and what artists deliver are not always the same thing. Giacomo Bufarini, an Italian artist who goes by the art name Run, painted the wall of a house with a giant silhouette of the woman who lived there. He incorporated a window into her head, like a window into her mind. Rather than being impressed by the concept, she complained that he had left the peeling paint on the window frame. ""I told her I'm not like a decorator,"" Bufarini recalled, sounding both peeved and guilty. Another artist, Ernesto Novo, had to tiptoe around a large bull while he painted a row of African statuettes onto a wall last March. The animal is still there (as is the art). The spirit of the open sky gallery is improvisational, just like the lives of many of the artists. Traveling through West Africa from France, an artist called the Wa, who would not give his real name, wound up in Senegal by accident after his visa expired in Mauritania, and he and his friends drove to Senegal ""for a beer."" Bufarini recalled that after finishing his painting, he, Diallo, and friends celebrated by going for a fish barbecue on the beach. Having no barbecue, they cooked on refrigerator racks scavenged from the trash, after burning off the plastic coating. The painted-houses project has gotten so big that this year, Delphine Buysse, a Belgian curator, has arranged for artists in residence to live at a luxury hotel in Dakar, the Pullman, for a week, while painting in the Médina. One of the most recent wall paintings was a collaboration between Kouka Ntadi, a Congolese-French artist, and Barkinado Bocoum, a Senegalese artist. Ntadi painted abstract portraits in black and white, and Bocoum added folksier portraits in bright colors. Ntadi loved sharing the neighborhood with the commercial artists of the barbershops and milk stores. ""I would say there is not really a border between the two in Africa,"" he said. ""It's not like in France or the US where there is a snobbism about art, and you can't be in marketing. So for sure, we can still be an artist and make a design for a bottle of milk or a side of beef.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5 states resisting creation of panels to promote the census  Link to Image ORLANDO - With billions in federal aid and seats in Congress at stake, some states are dragging their feet in carrying out one of the Census Bureau's chief recommendations for making sure everyone is counted during the 2020 census. Five states - Florida, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Texas - have not set up ""complete count committees"" that would create public awareness campaigns to encourage people to fill out the questionnaires. FULL TEXT In some of those states, politicians argued that a statewide body would be unnecessary, since local committees, cities, and nonprofit organizations are already working to publicize the census. In others, state leaders didn't see any urgency to act. The once-a-decade count of the US population starts in January in a remote area of Alaska. The rest of the nation takes part starting in the spring. ""We are encouraging others to join in,"" Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham said this month. ""The clock is ticking, and the time to join is now."" Six states - Iowa, Maine, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin - only got on board in the past several weeks. Officials say the committees can separate census winners from losers. ""Complete count committees are extremely effective,"" said Albert Fontenot, an associate director at the Census Bureau. ""It's in the states' interests in that they get a funding flow and congressional seats."" Of the holdout states, all but Louisiana have Republican governors. In Texas, a measure to create a committee died in the GOP-dominated Legislature earlier this year even though the second most populous state has the most to gain from the census - up to three congressional seats. Some Texas lawmakers were worried about losing their seats during redistricting if population surges favoring Democrats were found in urban and suburban areas, said Luis Figueroa, legislative and policy director at the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin. Also, at the time, the Trump administration was pushing to add a citizenship question to the form, and some lawmakers didn't want to take a stand on the issue by promoting the census, he said. The US Supreme Court later blocked the question. Twenty-six state governments are appropriating nearly $350 million to reach people and get them to respond to the census. The amounts range from California's record $187 million to Montana's $100,000, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. New York City is committing $40 million. States led by Democrats have spent more per capita. Of the 11 states spending at least $1 per resident, all but North Dakota have Democratic governors, according to an Associated Press analysis. California, which stands to lose a seat in Congress, is spending $4.73 per person, using the money to target certain ethnic communities, provide educational materials to schools, and identify community leaders who can personally encourage participation in the most populous state. Spending on outreach offers a great return on investment, said Ditas Katague, director of the California Complete Count-Census 2020 Office. ""You have to look at how many programs will suffer and how much money we will lose,"" Katague said. In 2000, when California spent $24 million, 76 percent of residents returned the questionnaires by mail, outstripping the national average. In 2010, in the aftermath of the recession and budget cuts, California spent only $2 million, and the mail response rate dropped to 73 percent, below the national average. In Florida, the third most populous state, bills establishing a statewide committee died in the GOP-controlled legislature. With an influx from such places as Puerto Rico and Venezuela, Florida has gained about 2.5 million people since 2010 and could pick up two more congressional seats. A spokeswoman for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said he is still reviewing what action should be taken to help get a full head count. ""The governor takes the census seriously,"" spokeswoman Helen Ferre said. In Nebraska, Republican Governor Pete Ricketts vetoed a bill to create a complete count committee, saying that local committees are already doing the work and that the legislation would have given a University of Nebraska program authority to create the panel without guidance from the state. The number of congressional seats for Nebraska is expected to remain unchanged. Still, ""ultimately I think this will be a loss for Nebraska, especially in terms of receiving federal funds,"" said state Senator Matt Hansen, a Democrat from Lincoln who sponsored the legislation. ""Specifically, I am concerned children, racial and ethnic minority populations, homeless persons, and those who live in rural and isolated areas will be undercounted.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NFL This Week: 49ers-Packers square off to highlight Week 12  Link to Image Link to Image Jimmy Garoppolo and the San Francisco 49ers refuse to look too far ahead on their schedule. Especially this week while staring at a showdown with Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers. The thing is, though, this matchup could go a long way in helping determine the teams' seeding when the playoffs start. So, this one Sunday night at Levi's Stadium will have a bit of a postseason feel for both the 49ers (9-1) and Packers (8-2). ""With the (49ers) faithful and everything, having them helping out the defense and just getting the place rocking will be huge,"" Garoppolo said. ""The louder they can be, the better. But, yeah, it'll be a big game Sunday. ""This is a great opportunity, great challenge for us."" It's also the highlight of a Week 12 slate of games on the NFL schedule. San Francisco begins a three-game stretch against teams currently in first place - and all with 8-2 records - including Green Bay, Baltimore and New Orleans. ""I don't even think about playoff seeding right now,"" 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. ""Our goal is to get in the playoffs. We're all right there. There's still a lot of football left. Each game we win, we've got a better chance at getting in there. You don't think about seeds, at least I don't, until you can narrow it down to one or two games. I think we're far from that right now."" The 49ers showed some resilience last week, rallying from 16 points down to beat Arizona for the team's biggest regular-season comeback since 2011. Meanwhile, the Packers are coming off a 24-16 victory over Carolina at home, giving them five wins in their past six games. ""We've been finding a way to win, different ways,"" Rodgers said. ""I think great teams understand their roles and embrace them and make it more about the team."" And, Green Bay is no stranger to playing in front of big TV audiences: The Packers are 3-1 in prime-time games this season. Week 12 started with Houston's 20-17 home victory over Indianapolis. Deshaun Watson threw two touchdown passes to DeAndre Hopkins and finished with 298 yards to help the Texans take the AFC South lead. Houston (7-4) rebounded from a 41-7 loss to Baltimore on Sunday. The Colts dropped to 6-5. Arizona (3-7-1), Minnesota (8-3), Kansas City (7-4) and the Los Angeles Chargers (4-7) are the final teams this season to take their bye-week breaks. BALTIMORE (8-2) at LOS ANGELES RAMS (6-4) Lamar Jackson and the Ravens play in LA on Monday night on a six-game winning streak, the longest active run in the NFL and the team's best since 2000 - when they won Super Bowl. Baltimore has done it mostly in dominant fashion, too, having won four in a row by 14 points or more. Jared Goff and the Rams have won three of four to stay in the NFC playoff race. Los Angeles will also see a familiar face: Ravens cornerback Marcus Peters was acquired in a trade with the Rams on Oct. 15 and has returned two interceptions for touchdowns while with Baltimore. DALLAS (6-4) at NEW ENGLAND (9-1) The Cowboys have the NFL's top-ranked offense, and the Patriots are ranked No. 1 in defense. So, something's got to give, right? Dallas' Dak Prescott leads the league with 322.1 passing yards per game and is on pace to be the first Cowboys QB to top the NFL in yards passing for a full season. He also has 38 wins since entering the NFL in 2016, second most in the league during that span behind - yep, you guessed it: the Patriots' Tom Brady. With a win Sunday, New England would extend its streak to 17 consecutive seasons with at least 10 wins - which would be an NFL record. SEATTLE (8-2) at PHILADELPHIA (5-5) This matchup is highlighted by streaking quarterbacks, with the Seahawks' Russell Wilson and Eagles' Carson Wentz each having thrown at least one touchdown pass in 13 consecutive regular-season games, the longest active run in the NFL. Wilson is looking to improve to 4-0 in his career against the Eagles. And, Seattle has been terrific on the road, going 5-0 so far away from home. Wentz and the Eagles are struggling on offense right now and are coming off a 17-10 loss to New England last week. CAROLINA (5-5) at NEW ORLEANS (8-2) Christian McCaffrey has been a huge bright spot in what has been an up-and-down season in Carolina. The Panthers running back is the first NFL player with at least 1,000 yards rushing and 500 yards receiving in his team's first 10 games of season. He has also eclipsed 140 scrimmage yards in each of past four games - although Carolina is 1-3 in those. New Orleans also has a record-breaking star on offense in wide receiver Michael Thomas, who leads the league with 94 receptions, the most by a player in the first 10 games of a season in NFL history. He's also the first player with 90-plus receptions in each of his first four seasons. JACKSONVILLE (4-6) at TENNESSEE (5-5) The Jaguars are looking to sweep the Titans for the first time since 2005 after Jacksonville made things miserable for then-Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota, who was sacked nine times in the 20-7 loss in Week 3. Ryan Tannehill is under center this time around for the Titans and has three-game winning drives in four starts. He has also been solid at home, where he has a 100 or higher passer rating in three games. Nick Foles is Jacksonville's quarterback for this meeting after Gardner Minshew played in his place while he sat out because of injury. Foles threw for 296 yards and two TDs with one interception in a 33-13 loss to Indianapolis, his first start since the opener. DENVER (3-7) at BUFFALO (7-3) The Bills are off to their best start after 10 games in 20 years, and the play of Josh Allen has been a big reason. Buffalo's second-year quarterback earned AFC offensive player of week honors after going 21 of 33 for 256 yards and three touchdowns passing and one rushing in a 37-20 win over Miami. Allen also has 163 pass attempts without an interception, dating to a 14-7 win at Tennessee in Week 6. The Broncos have been deadly - to themselves - late in games, having squandered four fourth-quarter leads. The latest was a doozy as Denver became the first team in five years to blow a 20-point first-half lead in a 27-23 loss to Minnesota last Sunday. It all has John Elway's Broncos in jeopardy of a second 3-8 record in three years. TAMPA BAY (3-7) at ATLANTA (3-7) The Falcons have won the past five meetings between the NFC South rivals, with the Buccaneers' previous victory coming over three years ago. Atlanta enters this matchup having won two in a row overall after starting the season 1-7. Meanwhile, Tampa Bay has lost five of its past six. What does it all mean? Well, the loser in this one will fall into sole possession of last place in the division. Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston leads the NFL with 22 turnovers, including a league-high 18 interceptions. He'll face a Falcons defense that had four interceptions in a win over Carolina. OAKLAND (6-4) at NEW YORK JETS (3-7) The Raiders are coming off having swept a three-game homestand for the first time since 1980. Now, they hit the road, where they're 1-3 this season. Oakland rookie running back Josh Jacobs has three 100-yard performances and ranks fourth in the NFL in rushing with 923 yards. He'll face a tough test in this one against a Jets defense that is allowing a league-low 79.1 yards rushing per game. Sam Darnold and the Jets have won two in a row, coming against the lowly Giants and Redskins. Now, New York looks to win three straight for the first time since Weeks 3-5 of the 2017 season - yes, over two years ago. MIAMI (2-8) at CLEVELAND (4-6) Both teams welcome playing a game after a turbulent week for each. The Dolphins released suspended running back Mark Walton after his arrest on charges of punching his pregnant girlfriend. Meanwhile, the Browns are dealing with the fallout from Myles Garrett's suspension for clobbering Pittsburgh's Mason Rudolph with the quarterback's helmet. Miami had its two-game winning streak end last week against Buffalo, and has been outscored by a league-worst 166 points while ranking last in turnover differential (minus-13) and takeaways (seven). Cleveland is creeping back toward the playoff picture after a slow start with two straight home wins. The Browns have helped themselves by not committing a turnover in their past three games. NEW YORK GIANTS (2-8) at CHICAGO (4-6) The Giants come off their bye-week break having dropped six straight and would clinch a third losing season in row with a loss. Saquon Barkley has struggled since returning from a high ankle sprain more than a month ago. Barkley has carried 64 times for 165 yards, an average of 2.57 yards, in four games against Arizona, Detroit, Dallas and the Jets - against whom he gained a career-worst 1 yard on 13 carries. Chicago has lost five of six, despite holding opponents under 20 points in three of the past four games. The problem has been on offense as the Bears rank 28th in scoring and 27th in touchdowns. DETROIT (3-6-1) at WASHINGTON (1-9) The Lions have dropped three in row for the third time under second-year coach Matt Patricia. It appears Detroit might have to try to snap the skid without quarterback Matthew Stafford, who's expected to miss his third consecutive game with a back injury. So, it's up to Jeff Driskel, who has three touchdowns and one interception this season in Stafford's place. The Redskins have lost four in a row overall, and nine straight at home, dating to last season. Rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins, sacked six times last week against the Jets, is expected to make his third NFL start. PITTSBURGH (5-5) at CINCINNATI (0-10) The Steelers will be short-handed in this one as they'll be without center Maurkice Pouncey, who's serving a suspension for his role in the brawl at the end of Pittsburgh's loss to Cleveland last week. Injured running back James Conner (shoulder) and wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster (concussion/knee) are also expected to miss the game. The Steelers have this going for them: They've won nine straight in the series, 12 of 13 and 17 of 20. Oh, and there's also the fact the Bengals are the only winless team in the NFL and have matched the worst start in club history and its longest losing streak. ___ More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and            https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kim clings to 1-shot lead with $1.5 million on the line  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image NAPLES, Fla. (AP) - Sei Young Kim was on the verge of taking all the drama out of the chase for the richest payoff in women's golf history. She opened with three birdies in seven holes Saturday in the CME Group Tour Championship as her challengers either stalled or faded. She led by five shots before making the turn. Kim hit the brakes. Nelly Korda hit the gas. When the third round ended at Tiburon Golf Club, Kim had to settle for a 4-under 68 and a one-shot lead over Korda with one round remaining to see who wins the $1.5 million. Both made it sound as though it will be just another round of golf. Then again, no one in LPGA Tour history has ever played for this much cash. It's more than either of them has made all year. ""I had a pretty solid round front nine,"" Kim said. ""But back nine was little tough to focus. I kept thinking about future, so I was like, 'Nope, Sei Young. Stop thinking. Focus on it.' I had a lot of chances back nine. Going to practice and ready for tomorrow."" Korda, who has a chance to reach No. 2 in the women's world ranking with a victory, fell back early with a double bogey by going long of the green on the par-3 fourth. She recovered with three birdies over the next five holes, and then really turned it on. ""Kind of hit the brakes every single day on the back nine,"" Korda said. ""I told myself to be really aggressive on the back nine, and it worked out today."" She opened with three straight birdies, holing out from a greenside bunker on No. 11, and she was back in the game. Korda shot a 31 on the back nine for a 66. Kim was at 16-under 200 and will be in the final group with Korda. Caroline Masson of Germany, who will join them in the final pairing, had a 70 and was four shots behind, with Charley Hull of England another shot behind after a 66. For so many others, an ideal day for scoring at Tiburon turned out to be a lost opportunity. Brooke Henderson of Canada, who attracted the biggest gallery playing with Korda and with a horde of Canadians in Florida for the winter, had bogeys on three of the par 5s and never got anything going for a 71. She was six shots behind. Defending champion Lexi Thompson made an early charge, only to be slowed by a pair of bogeys on the back - all her bogeys this week have been on the back nine - that gave her a 70 and put her seven shots behind. Kim has shown few signs of coming back to the field. She has made only one bogey through 54 holes, and with her strong start it looked as though the 26-year-old Korean might run away from the field. The back nine changed everything. Korda appeared to be in trouble on No. 11 when she fanned a shot from the waste area into a bunker. She blasted it out and watched the ball crash into the pin and drop for birdie. She made another at the par-3 12th and took advantage at the end with a 4-hybrid on the green at the par-5 17th for at two-putt birdie. Kim gave herself plenty of reasonable looks at birdie on the back nine. She couldn't get any to fall except for a 25-footer on the 15th hole that restored her lead to two shots, but only briefly. Kim's second shot into the 17th was well short and to the right into a bunker, and she blasted out to some 30 feet away. She played away from the flag on the 18th and two-putted for par from about 40 feet. Still, she was in the lead after the third straight day, one step closer to a massive payoff. The format changed this year from a points-based system in which only the top 12 players had a shot at a $1 million bonus to any of the 60 players who made it to the Tour Championship getting $1.5 million in official money by winning the tournament. Jin Young Ko, celebrated Thursday night as LPGA player of the year, tried to get back into the game with a 66. She still was six shots behind along with Jessica Korda (69), the older sister of Nelly Korda. Ko is virtually a lock to win the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average and needs a 65 to become only the second woman to finish with a sub-69 average score for the year. ___ For more AP golf coverage: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and            https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prince Andrew's friendship with Epstein joins a list of royal scandals  LONDON - The British monarchy has survived public crises before - religious schisms, revolutions, murderous kings - but this week the royal family scrambled to confront a relatively new opponent: the embarrassing televised interview. The Duke of York, better known as Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, struggled to defend himself during a 50-minute interview with the BBC as he talked about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier accused of sex trafficking. His interview, widely criticized in the British press as disastrous after it was broadcast last weekend, catapulted a long-simmering controversy into a full-blown scandal for the royal family, among the worst in its modern history. FULL TEXT Reacting to the backlash, the prince announced Wednesday that he was indefinitely stepping away from public life, with permission from the queen. But over the past century, a number of scandals have rattled the British royal family. Andrew's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein The prince's relationship with Epstein, whom he met in 1999, has been under scrutiny for years. In the BBC interview, the prince said he had attended dinner parties in which Epstein hosted ""cosmopolitan"" figures from politics, academia, and business, and the men visited each other's homes several times. But Andrew said he had seen ""no indication"" of wrongdoing by Epstein at the time. In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution, and served 13 months in a Florida county jail under a widely criticized plea deal. After his release in 2010, Andrew stayed at Epstein's Manhattan mansion and was widely criticized for continuing the relationship. This summer, after the financier was arrested on federal charges and details of allegations against him began to emerge, attention again turned to Andrew's friendship. In August, Epstein killed himself in a New York jail. One of his accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, said that Epstein had trafficked her to Andrew, and that the prince had sex with her three times, an accusation that he denies. As pressure mounted, the prince agreed to the BBC interview. But the response to the broadcast was immediate and vocal, especially around what appeared to be the prince's lack of sympathy for Epstein's victims. Businesses and organizations associated with the prince quickly distanced themselves from him. Charles and Diana's failed marriage Andrew was not the first royal of his generation to find himself under fire after a televised interview. His older brother, Prince Charles, in an effort to win back popularity after separating from his first wife, Diana, agreed to appear in a 1994 documentary. But when the prince confessed to adultery, he immediately lost the good will he had been desperately trying to rebuild. Their father, Prince Philip, said at the time that he did not understand why his son would air his troubles in public, but the interview had been approved in advance by the queen. A year later, Princess Diana said in an interview that ""there were three of us in this marriage,"" referring to Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles, who later became his second wife. Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after years of separation. The next year, after Diana died in a car accident in Paris while being followed by the paparazzi, the royal family came under fire for appearing to be ""indifferent to the country's sorrow."" Princess Margaret's love life Two decades before Charles's divorce, the divorce of his aunt, Princess Margaret, from the Earl of Snowdon scandalized the royal family. For decades, Margaret had found herself at the center of scrutiny from within the royal family and from the public, mostly centered on her love life, at times drawing sympathy and at others attracting admonishment. Her fun-loving nature and glamorous lifestyle - with parties, extravagant clothes, and celebrity friends - became a staple of the British press. But her romance in the 1950s with Group Captain Peter Townsend, a divorced royal aide, was a tipping point. Her sister, Elizabeth, was head of the Church of England, which forbade divorce. And with memories of the uproar surrounding the abdication of King Edward VIII to marry a twice-divorced American still fresh, there was intense pressure on Margaret to end the affair. The princess chose not to step away from royal life and marry him. Nearly a decade later, she fell for a photographer, Antony Armstrong-Jones, who became the Earl of Snowdon after they married. But their tumultuous relationship ended in divorce in 1976. Margaret's love life became a major plot point in the Netflix period series ""The Crown,"" which explores the inner world of the royal family. A gaffe-prone Philip Elizabeth's 98-year-old husband, Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, has found himself in hot water over offhand comments to the press. Unlike his wife, who maintains a measured public persona, he can be blunt and prone to gaffes. Some of his comments have been offensive or outright racist. ""If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed,"" he told British students in China during a 1986 visit. ""It looks as if it was put in by an Indian,"" he said in 1999, pointing to an old-fashioned fuse box in a factory in Scotland. ""Everybody was saying we must have more leisure. Now they are complaining they are unemployed,"" he said during the 1981 recession.

Two days after the crash, he was photographed driving without his seat belt fastened and was reprimanded by a police officer. The brief reign of Edward VIII In the 1920s, Prince Edward, Elizabeth's uncle, was so well known for his indulgences that he was the subject of a song: ""I danced with a man who danced with a girl who danced with the Prince of Wales."" But it was a relationship with one particular woman that ultimately shook the royal family. In 1930, he met Wallis Simpson, a married woman from Baltimore who traveled in the same high-society circles. After the death of his father, King George V, Edward pursued her despite the opposition of his mother, Queen Mary, and the prime minister at the time, Stanley Baldwin. When the prince succeeded his father to the throne in 1936, a standoff ensued. Simpson sought a divorce from her husband, and the British government advised the new king against marrying her.

"No. 19 Iowa shuts down Illinois 19-10 behind Stanley, Duncan  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - Iowa's defense made sure the team that was leading the nation in turnover margin gave up the ball. The No. 19 Hawkeyes forced three turnovers in Saturday's 19-10 win over Illinois, another stout performance from a defense that has been shutting teams down all season. Iowa (8-3, 5-3 Big Ten), which came into the game allowing just 12.4 points per game, held Illinois to its lowest point total of the season one week after doing the same thing to Minnesota in a 23-19 win. ""There's no quit in those guys,"" Iowa quarterback Nate Stanley said. ""They kept us in a lot of games this year. And quite frankly, they've won a lot of games for this year with the way they've played."" This win was punctuated by the turnovers. Illinois quarterback Brandon Peters threw an interception to Michael Ojemudia on the Fighting Illini's first possession of the game, then threw an interception to Matt Hankins in the end zone in the third quarter. Peters also lost a fumble in the fourth quarter. ""That was big-time,"" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. ""We did a great job of getting takeaways."" The Illini (6-5, 4-4) saw their four-game winning streak come to an end. ""It definitely was big,"" Ojemudia said of getting the takeaways. ""We knew going into this game they were going to give us their best shot. They're a hot team. Just tightening down (on defense) was what we wanted to do in this game."" Iowa had forced just 13 turnovers in the first 10 games. ""We felt like we haven't been getting that many turnovers this year,"" safety Geno Stone said. ""I definitely feel like we got them this game."" The Illini, who had outscored opponents 79-22 in the second half in their winning streak, got into Iowa territory on three consecutive possessions in the second half, but only got a field goal. ""We had the opportunities,"" Illinois coach Lovie Smith said. ""But we didn't make the plays today."" Stanley threw for 308 yards and Keith Duncan kicked four field goals to set a new Big Ten single-season mark. Iowa opened the game with a touchdown for the second consecutive week when Tyler Goodson scored on a 2-yard run for a 7-0 lead. Illinois tied the game when Peters threw a 31-yard pass to Donny Navarro later in the first quarter. From that point, it was all field goals. Duncan had field goals of 23, 45, 24 and 29 yards to make it 27 this season for the conference record. Illinois' James McCourt kicked a 28-yarder in the fourth quarter. THE TAKEAWAY Iowa has won six consecutive games in this rivalry, but this was a competitive game. The Hawkeyes had won the last three games by a combined score of 137-16, including last season's 63-0 game. POLL IMPLICATIONS Iowa could move up a spot or two with the win. Illinois had received a vote in last week's poll. Both teams were already bowl eligible. KICKING GAME Duncan had his third game of the season with four field goals. He also missed two field goals in the game. Duncan is 27 of 32 in field goals this season. ""Of course, we would like to get touchdowns on every single drive,"" Duncan said. ""But our goal is to get points. We did that four out of the six times today on field goals, and we're happy to do that."" UP NEXT Iowa plays at Nebraska on Friday. Illinois plays at home against Northwestern next Saturday. ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and            https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bolivian Senate OKs new election, bars ex-president  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) - Bolivia's Senate on Saturday unanimously approved a measure calling for new presidential elections that would exclude ousted leader Evo Morales - a key step toward pacifying a nation since an Oct. 20 marred by reported irregularities. The measure forbids reelection of anyone who has served the last two terms consecutively as president, effectively ruling out Morales, whose refusal to accept such term limits was a key issue in protests against him. The bill now goes to the lower house, which like the Senate is dominated by Morales' Movement Toward Socialism party. The measure did not set a date for the vote. Morales' claim of victory and a fourth term in the Oct. 20 election prompted massive protests that led him to resign on Nov. 10 at the army's suggestion. An audit by a team from the Organization of American States found widespread irregularities in that election. After Morales left for asylum in Mexico, his own supporters took to the streets in protest. Officials say at least 32 people have died in demonstrations since the presidential election, which would be annulled by Saturday's vote. An agreement on elections between Morales' party and the interim government helped pacify the country. Street blockades were lifted, allowing supplies to reach marketplaces Saturday in areas that had been short of groceries and gas. Sen. Oscar Ortiz said the bill calls for updating the electoral rolls, naming a completely new electoral tribunal to oversee the vote. ""We have to generate confidence in the population,"" said Sen. Omar Aguilar, from Morales' party. Later Saturday, interim President Jeanine Áñez rejected a bill presented by Morales' party that would have prevented the ousted president from being tried for alleged crimes committed during the exercise of his functions to date. ""With respect to approving this bill in favor of those who have committed crimes and who now seek impunity, my decision is clear and firm: I will not promulgate this law,"" Áñez said. The bill remains paralyzed, lawmakers said. On Friday, the interim government accused Morales of terrorism and sedition for purportedly organizing highway blockades intended to prevent food from reaching some cities. Acting Interior Minister Arturo Murillo said the complaint relates to a video in which Morales is supposedly heard in a phone call coordinating the blockades from Mexico. Murillo said Bolivia's government is seeking a maximum penalty, which is between 15 and 20 years in prison. Morales has said the video is a ""montage"" by his opponents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Steelers QB Rudolph fined $50,000 for brawl with Browns  Link to Image CLEVELAND (AP) - Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph didn't escape the brawl with the Browns unpunished. Rudolph was fined $50,000 on Saturday by the NFL for his involvement in the melee that began when Browns defensive end Myles Garrett pulled off his helmet and hit him over the head with it. Rudolph avoided suspension for his actions - he tried to pull off Garrett's helmet and charged him - but was one of 33 players fined by the league for their involvement. The league penalized 29 players $3,507 apiece for ""entering the fight area."" In all, the league handed out more than $700,000 for discipline stemming from the ugly final seconds of Cleveland's 21-7 win over Pittsburgh last week. There was another $77,206 assessed for personal fouls earlier in the game. Garrett was indefinitely suspended by the league for tearing off Rudolph's helmet and using it ""as a weapon."" His appeal was denied this week when he told appeals officer James Thrash that Rudolph used a racial slur against him. Rudolph wrestled with Garrett and unsuccessfully tried to yank off the Pro Bowler's helmet before running after him and then being struck on the top of the head. Earlier this week, Rudolph said there was ""no acceptable excuse,"" for his behavior. He has denied using the racial slur, and the league has found no evidence such a slur was used. The league also fined the Steelers and Browns $250,000 apiece. The AFC North rivals play again Dec. 1 in Pittsburgh. Garrett was also fined $45,623 for his shocking attack, which will cost him the rest of the regular season and playoffs - if Cleveland qualifies without him. Garrett will also lose $1.14 million in game checks. The league said Garrett must meet with Commissioner Roger Goodell's office before he can be reinstated. Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey was suspended three games and fined $35,096 for punching and kicking Garrett. Appeals officer Derrick Brooks reduced Pouncey's ban to two, but he'll miss next Sunday's game against the Steelers. Browns defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi was suspended for Sunday's game against Miami for shoving Rudolph to the ground. Thrash upheld Ogunjobi's suspension but rescinded his $10,527 fine. ___ More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and            https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Navy may expel SEAL, defying Trump  Link to Image The secretary of the Navy and the admiral who leads the SEALs have threatened to resign or be fired if plans to expel a commando from the elite unit in a war crimes case are halted by President Trump, administration officials said Saturday. The Navy is proceeding with the disciplinary plans against the commando, Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, who counts Trump as one of his most vocal supporters. After reversing a demotion in recent days, the president suggested on Thursday that he would intervene again in the case, saying that the sailor should remain in the unit. FULL TEXT The threats by the Navy secretary, Richard Spencer, and the commander, Rear Admiral Collin Green, are a rare instance of pushback against Trump from members of the Defense Department. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, scrambled to come up with a face-saving compromise this past week in the hope that Trump could be persuaded to change his mind. On Thursday, Trump, referring to the pin that signifies membership in an elite force, said on Twitter that ""The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin."" He added: ""This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!"" One argument that officials said may be relied on is the assumption that a tweet does not constitute a formal presidential order. Esper and Milley conveyed to the president that if he followed up that tweet with a direct order, there would be huge consequences: Trump would lose Spencer and Green, further infuriate his top military leadership, and do untold damage to decades of military justice doctrine, according to administration officials. Administration officials said they now hoped that Trump would allow the proceedings to continue, but it is unclear whether the president will do so. The debate over Gallagher comes as Trump, facing a difficult reelection battle and an impeachment inquiry, has increasingly sought to highlight his role as commander in chief. Gallagher was accused of shooting civilians, murdering a captive Islamic State fighter with a hunting knife in Iraq, and threatening to kill SEALs who reported him, among other misconduct. His court-martial ended in acquittal on those charges. But the Navy ultimately demoted the chief, who was convicted of one charge: bringing discredit to the armed forces by posing for photos with the teenage captive's dead body. Gallagher's lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, said the president was right to stop the process of ousting the commando because the Navy's move was clear retribution, coming just days after the president's decision to restore his rank. ""With the timing, it's difficult to see how this was anything but a direct, public rebuke to the president,"" Parlatore said. ""So I can't see how the secretary of defense or anyone else is going to convince the president that is OK."" On Friday, Spencer made clear that he wanted to move forward with the matter, which could strip Gallagher of his Trident pin. ""I believe the process matters for good order and discipline,"" he told Reuters in an interview at a security forum in Nova Scotia. On Saturday, a Navy spokesman pointed to those remarks. ""The secretary's comments are in line with current White House guidance,"" said Rear Admiral Charlie Brown, the chief spokesman for the Navy. A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. The gold insignia Trident pin is one of the most revered in the military. It features an eagle on an anchor, clutching a flintlock pistol and a trident, and represents the grit of sailors who made it through some of the toughest training in the Navy, and are given some of the riskiest missions. It stands for fidelity and sacrifice. Even in death, the pin plays a role: SEALs pound their pins into the wood of fallen comrades' caskets. The Pentagon had already been quietly fuming this month after Trump cleared three members of the armed services, including Gallagher, who were accused or had been convicted of war crimes, overruling military leaders who sought to punish them. All three were lionized by conservative commentators who portrayed them as war heroes unfairly prosecuted for actions taken in the heat of battle. Trump, who was lobbied heavily by the families of the three service members, announced on Nov. 15 that he was reversing the demotion of Gallagher. He also ordered the full pardon of Clint Lorance, a former Army lieutenant, from the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, where he was serving a 19-year sentence for the murder of two civilians; and of Major Mathew L. Golsteyn, an Army Special Forces officer who was facing murder charges for killing an unarmed Afghan he believed was a Taliban bomb maker. One of the jurors who convicted Gallagher expressed dismay at the president's actions in an interview on Friday, noting that the all-military jury had given Gallagher the maximum punishment allowable under the law because it found his behavior so reprehensible. He spoke out for the first time to defend the decision of the jury. ""People keep saying all he did is pose in a photo and there were lots of other guys in the photo,"" said the juror, who asked that his name not be used to protect the privacy of the deliberations. ""But he was the senior enlisted guy there, the oldest, the most experienced. He should have set an example for good order and discipline. He should have ensured stuff like that wasn't happening. And he didn't. He doesn't deserve to wear chief's anchors."" The juror said he hoped the Trident review process would be allowed to go forward, adding, ""Let other SEALs decide if he deserves to be a SEAL.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Myles Powell leads No. 13 Seton Hall past Florida A&M 87-51  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Myles Powell yelled ""smile a little bit"" to Seton Hall coach Kevin Willard as the star player was on his way out of the media room. No chance. Powell scored 23 points and Jared Rhoden had 10 points and 12 rebounds, leading No. 13 Seton Hall to an 87-51 victory over winless Florida A&M on Saturday. The Pirates pulled away from the Rattlers after a sleepy week of practice and a shaky start, and Willard wasn't pleased with his team's performance in front of a crowd of 9,656 at the Prudential Center. ""We had a great crowd coming for a 12 o'clock game,"" he said. ""We kind of slept walked through 20 minutes of a game. Our kids play hard, they're fun to watch, but you can't come out and sleepwalk when people come out and watch it. It's unacceptable."" Quincy McKnight had 14 points and five assists for Seton Hall (4-1), which led by 18 before carrying a 36-24 advantage into the break. Willard is ""just saying that as the team that we want to be that we got to practice to get better, not just to get through it,"" Powell said, ""and he said all week that's all we were doing, was just trying to get through practice and just get it over with. He said it shows today. ""The score - I don't feel as though we were playing our best basketball."" Rod Melton Jr. led Florida A&M with 12 points. M.J. Randolph had 11 points and nine rebounds. Florida A&M (0-5) pulled within single digits several times in the second half. Melton's basket on a break made it 43-35 with 16:08 left. After Nasir Core scored to trim Seton Hall's lead to 47-38 with 13:57 left, the Pirates responded with a 15-1 run. Powell made a layup to make it 62-39 with 9:25 remaining. BIG PICTURE Seton Hall: The Pirates continue to look the part of a Top 25 team despite their lulls against a lowly opponent. The next stretch will be a good litmus test for March - they head to the Bahamas for the Battle 4 Atlantis to play No. 11 Oregon and potentially No. 8 Gonzaga. No. 5 North Carolina, Alabama, Iowa State and Michigan are the other Power Five teams in the event. Florida A&M: Coming off a 12-19 season, the Rattlers are still looking for their first win of the season, and the upcoming schedule doesn't look very good. They visit Kansas State on Dec. 2 and No. 20 Tennessee on Dec. 4. POLL IMPLICATIONS With this being the only game of the week for Seton Hall, the Pirates should stay about where they are in the Top 25. SANDRO SITS Willard benched Sandro Mamukelashvili for the second half. Willard said he wasn't playing well.

"Mike Babcock wasn't given enough runway in Toronto  Link to Image Much like Vegas, every act grows old in coaching, and a voice gone stale was part of the reason why the Maple Leafs on Wednesday sent Mike Babcock packing some four-plus years into his record eight-year/$50 million pact to turn around the Blue and White. As measured by rounds won by the Leafs in the playoffs (zero), Babcock's coaching tenure in Toronto was an abject failure. But that would be an unfair portrayal of his full tenure behind the bench, an impressive 173-133-45 (.557) regular-season mark that included a pair of 100-point seasons and three playoff berths (8-12 record) the last three seasons. The Leafs, let us not forget, had DNQ'd for 9 of 10 postseasons prior to Babcock's arrival. They had morphed into Canada's version of the pre-Mike Ilitch Dead Wings. To date, they still haven't won a playoff round since 2004. A full generation of Leafs fans, among the most avid in the Original 31, now have lived without the sweet springtime intoxication of a Cup run in Southern Ontario. FULL TEXT Now, did Babcock deserve to get whacked? Both his bona fides (including a Cup in Detroit, a pair of Olympic golds with Canada) and his overall mark across four seasons with the Leafs say no. He is the same solid, smart, determined bench mentor that led Leafs leadership, including team president Brendan Shanahan, to bring him aboard when he became a free agent in Detroit in the spring of 2015. But again, acts age out, voices lose their pitch, and perhaps more critical in this case, the 56-year-old Babcock lacked the equity (protection) that postseason success typically builds. If not for that mega contract, which lifted the pay level for coaching brethren across the league, he might have been turfed with no playoff success after only three seasons on the job. That's just the way it works. The equity of the '11 Cup and a trip to the '13 Final helped to keep Claude Julien on the job here even through the back-to-back playoff DNQ's of 2015 and '16. Fact is, if not for back-to-back Game 7 flip-of-the-coin knockouts at the hands of the Bruins the past two Aprils, perhaps Babcock is still on the job, even despite his tepid (9-10-4) start this season. Coaching, forever dirty work, even for guys with 700 career wins and a trophy case of shiny hardware (albeit one surprisingly lacking a Jack Adams Award as Coach of the Year). Hard to envision a quick turnaround for Sheldon Keefe, newly-installed as Babcock's successor, but many (hand high here) said exactly that in February 2017 when Bruce Cassidy was promoted to the No. 1 gig. Cassidy took control when the Bruins were doddering along at 26-23-6, both feet firmly planted on a path to a third consecutive DNQ. Cassidy's combination of change in offensive approach and overall messaging (read: new voice) delivered a galloping 18-8-1 finish and a date with Ottawa in playoffs. So it can happen, and Keefe, 39, much like Cassidy, helped channel upward of 10 current players to the Leafs' varsity during his stellar four-plus seasons in charge of the AHL Marlies, including a Calder Cup title in '18. Babcock is known as an old-school, no-nonsense taskmaster, though one laced with some keen wit. Keefe, long ago a fringe forward with the Lightning, will begin with a lighter message more like Cassidy's, emphasizing a slight change in the offensive attack and an overall less rigid, narrow game plan. ""He lets us be more creative,"" Marlies back liner and first-round pick, Timothy Liljegren told Sportsnet when the change was made Wednesday. A key difference, though, when comparing the Leafs of November 2019 and the Bruins on February 2017 is the overall structure and competence (i.e talent level) of the rosters. From the start, Babcock was handed a lineup riddled with holes, one that only became more porous amid the front-office transition that left Kyle Dubas standing as GM and Lou Lamoriello bolting for Long Island, where he has resurrected the risible Isles. The current Leafs roster is top heavy in elite and semi-elite, highly-expensive talent up front, including a $40 million-plus cap hit in four forwards: Mitch Marner, John Tavares, Auston Matthews, and William Nylander. Anyone would want them on their roster (remember, the Bruins pursued Tavares as a UFA in the summer of 2018), but at what price? Their cap drain is horrendous and compromising in a fixed-cap system. The Leafs have what at best could be labeled a highly-ordinary defensive unit, and they don't have a suitable backup to allow No. 1 goaltender Frederik Andersen to take a blow. Dubas, with Shanahan watching over him, has engineered a pricey, compromised, gritless squad designed around winning with today's standard model of speed and skill. That's a fine model, backed with a trove of analytics, but it's talented men and not Corsi-lovin' mathematicians who win games. The Bruins inherited by Cassidy had Anton Khudobin as a competent backup to No. 1 Tuukka Rask. They had captain Zdeno Chara as the unique shutdown lynchpin to a defensive corps that included the likes of Kevan Miller and Adam McQuaid as extra steel wool to smooth out, shall we say, rough spots. They had Patrice Bergeron, who that June would pick up his fourth Selke Trophy as the game's best defensive forward, as the NHL's consummate 200-foot player. From here, albeit some 500 miles southeast, there appears to be no quick fix for the Leafs on par with Cassidy's 18-8-1 igniter switch. Beyond the different voice behind the bench, which they may or may not have needed, they have to build some will and temerity around that slick forward group, find a first- or second-pairing defenseman who at least can increase level of play back there from a C-minus to a B, and also find a suitable (read: NHL capable) backup so Andersen, 30, isn't assigned to assisted living by early March. Easy enough to blame Babcock. In a span of 40 years now, the Leafs have turfed their coach eight times with the season in progress. They remain without a Cup since 1967. Not even five years after hiring Babcock to close the championship gap, today they only look further from the goal. TARGET OF CRITICISM Equipment fails for these fans Link to Image Vegas goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury made a dazzling, Cirque de Soleil-like save Tuesday night, springing backward from the top of his crease, twisting and flashing his glove (Ole!) to snare a Nic Petan backhand sweep that was all but certified for delivery to the top shelf. Just watching Fleury's gyrations triggered back spasms in your aged, faithful puck chronicler. ""I think those saves that make you feel you scored,"" Fleury, 34, told the media following the 4-2 VGK win over the Leafs. ""Those are the saves I love to play for."" The stop, with less than four minutes to go in regulation, kept Vegas in front, 3-2, and Cody Eakin sealed the deal with 21 seconds to go. It turned out to be Babcock's final night behind the Leafs' bench. As for the Fleury's stop, quickly labeled on the internet as the ""Superman Save,'' yes, it was stupendous. An absolute must-see on YouTube. But at the risk of sounding like a curmudgeon - or even worse, a Boomer! - it also served as yet another reminder how equipment innovations - specifically the lightweight leg pads, in this case - have diminished dramatically the ability for shooters to score. The game has grown simply too far weighted toward the goalies. The light, streamlined leg pads have been in vogue for 30-plus years. So many fans of the current game don't recall the days, well into the 1980s, when tenders wore heavy leather pads stuffed with animal hair (be it horse, deer, or otherwise). Those old pads absorbed sweat and ice shavings, adding weight and restricting mobility. Goalies have made dazzling saves, some even greater than Fleury's masterpiece, dating before the time of vulcanized rubber. When I started this gig in the late '70s, my game stories often centered on a holy trinity present in most games: a great goal, a great save, and a great fight. Too often now, games are minus all three, particularly the fighting (a good thing) and the dazzling goal (a tissue for an old man, please). Great saves? Because of the butterfly style, the state of the art in modern goaltending is more blocking than saving. Not much thrill in a block. Without those lightweight pads, chances of Fleury making that stop on Petan would have been all but zilch. Yes, he could have sprung back, but the heavy pads would have left his legs anchored to the ice like dock moorings. He might have snared the shot with an old leather glove, but those models were vastly smaller than today's outsized Venus flytraps. Prime scoring chances should have at least an equal chance of going in the net as the goalie has of keeping them out of the net. It's simply not the case. If Fleury's dazzling save doesn't prove it, the shootout alone should be proof. Slightly more than two of every three shooters fail to score in the shootout. Time to scale back the gear and at least make it a 50-50 proposition. Getting a leg up Lemelin was light years ahead Link to Image Jacques Plante was the father of the goalie mask, wearing it in an NHL game for the first time 60 years ago (Nov. 1, 1959) when he backstopped the Habs. The innovator of the lightweight leg pads? Ex-Bruins netminder Reggie Lemelin, who came to Boston in the summer of 1987, just months after he first started using the sponge-like leg coverings in his days as a Calgary Flame. ""The first ones were like gold-and-strawberry colored,"" Lemelin recalled the other day when reached by phone. ""Heck, they were talking about me everywhere - not for my saves, but for how I looked."" The revolutionary pads, recalled Lemelin, were the brainchild of Jim Lowson, an inventor/designer from Mill Valley, Calif., who initially approached Flames goalie Mike Vernon about the idea. Vernon, some eight-plus years younger than Lemelin, didn't have his interest piqued when Lowson made his sales pitch one day at practice. ""This guy comes in with these crazy pads,"" remembered Lemelin. ""He talks to Mike and says, 'Look, I've got this prototype. It's very light. It's all foam. But I need to work with somebody to help me develop this.' Mike is this kid, like 21 years old, and looking at him like he has two heads."" A disappointed Lowson ""got the hint,"" noted Lemelin, and headed out of the rink that day, a man with a cause but minus a goaltender. ""He's leaving, almost with his head down, and I come by and say, 'Hey, I am Reggie Lemelin, the other goalie,' '' he recalled. ""And he says, 'Oh, I know who you are.' And I said, 'Look, you approached the wrong guy - this kid doesn't give a crap about what you've got. He's just starting his career. But I might. Because I see the potential. I'll work with you.' And that's how it all started."" During the 1987 All-Star break, Lemelin flew to San Francisco to work out design specs with Lawson, and he finally used the first pair in an NHL game that March. Lowson and Lemelin soon worked with a Connecticut-based manufacturer, and within a year or two of Lemelin arriving in Boston, a handful of other NHL tenders were wearing the groundbreaking Aeroflex lightweight pads. Lemelin dusted off the one pair he kept in January 2016 for the Habs-Bruins alumni game at the Outdoor Classic at Gillette Stadium. The new pads weighed 2 ½ pounds each and absorbed no water. Lemelin's old leather pads, stuffed with deer hair, were approximately 6 pounds each when dry, and absorbed another 3 or 4 pounds of water weight during games. ""I got on the scale once after a game,"" recalled Lemelin, whose playing weight was approximately 170 pounds, ""and all the gear, including the pads, gloves, chest protector and all that came to 32 pounds.'"" Kiddingly, Lemelin added that his stand-up style in net was in large part because, ""I didn't want the sweat to drain into my equipment."" Now a membership ambassador at Ferncroft Country Club in Middleton, where he has worked the past three years, the 65-year-old Lemelin lives in Peabody and suits up as a forward with the Bruins Alumni squad. It takes a few hours for the former goalie's aches and pains to dissipate each morning. ""Might have been different if those pads were invented a few years earlier,"" he said, ""the bastards!"" Loose pucks Out of work less than a week after his abrupt dismissal by Sportsnet, Don Cherry began his career comeback Tuesday with his revived ""Grapevine"" podcast, joined by son Tim and grandson Del. Had ""Grapes"" apologized on air for his divisive ""you people"" comment made on Hockey Night In Canada, the ex-Bruins coach likely could have kept his TV gig. But he wouldn't budge. ""I lived in a vicious world,"" Cherry said on the podcast, summing up his long, oft-controversial TV tenure, ""and I lasted 38 years."" All subsequent ""Grapevine"" episodes will post on Mondays throughout the hockey season. ""I'm glad,"" added Cherry, ""I'm going out on my shield."" . . . Only one coach, Pat Burns, has won three Adams Awards as Coach of the Year: Burns, who won it with the Bruins in '98, also won it in Montreal ('89) and Toronto ('93).

Thankfully, we see fewer of those seek-and-destroy explosions in today' game, in large part because of rulebook changes that came in the wake of Matt Cooke's predatory head shot on Marc Savard. Kariya dished the puck as he approached his offensive blue line, admired his pass for a second, and got sent to Palookaville (shoulder to head) by the menacing Stevens. It took that hit on Savard some seven years later (March 2010) for the Lords of the Boards finally to decide to punish hits that primarily target a player's head . . .

"Mass women's protest in Paris denounces domestic violence  Link to Image PARIS - Tens of thousands of protesters marched through Paris on Saturday to demand a national wake-up call and more government investment to prevent deadly domestic violence against women, a problem that President Emmanuel Macron calls ""France's shame."" A wave of purple flags and signs snaked from the Place de l'Opera through eastern Paris amid an unprecedented public campaign to decry violence against women - and to honor the 130 women that activists say have been killed in France this year by a current or former partner. That's about one every two or three days. FULL TEXT While France has a progressive reputation and pushes for women's rights around the world, it has among the highest rates in Europe of domestic violence, in part because of poor police response to reports of abuse. Many of the women killed this year had previously sought help from police. At Saturday's march - one of the biggest demonstrations this year in Paris - French film and TV stars joined abuse victims and activists calling for an end to ""femicide."" Many held banners reading ""Sick of Rape."" The protest came on the UN's International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and is aimed at pressuring the French government before it unveils new measures Monday to tackle the problem. The measures are expected to include seizing firearms from people suspected of domestic violence and prioritizing police training so they won't brush off women's complaints as a private affair. ""We live in a culture that finds excuses for assailants,"" Alyssa Ahrabare, spokeswoman for activist group Osez le Féminisme (Try feminism), told The Associated Press. She called for better training for people in police stations and hospitals who come in contact with victims of domestic violence, and more shelters for abused women. Some of Saturday's marchers want 1 billion euros in government investment, though the funding is expected to fall far short of that. French activists have stepped up efforts this year to call attention to the problem, with an unusual campaign of gluing posters around Paris and other cities every time another woman is killed. The posters honor the women and call for action. The activists also hold protests, lying down on the pavement to represent the slain women. A 2014 EU survey of 42,000 women across all 28 member states found 26 percent of French respondents said they been abused by a partner since age 15, either physically or sexually. That's below the global average of 30 percent, according to UN Women. But it's above the EU average and the sixth highest among EU countries. Half that number reported experiencing such abuse in Spain, which implemented a series of legal and educational measures in 2004 that slashed its domestic violence rates. Conversations about domestic violence have also ratcheted up in neighboring Germany, where activists are demanding that the term ''femicide'' be used to describe such killings. In France, lawyers and victims' advocates say they're encouraged by the new national conversation, which they say marks a departure from decades of denial. Women aren't the only victims of domestic violence, but French officials say they make up the vast majority. Béatrice Donnard, 54, activist with the group NousToutes (All of Us), noted that killings often occur when a couple separates, saying, ""It's an entire system that needs to be taken down."" ""Each woman you talk to - you could ask your mother or your sister - has a story of sexual violence in one way or another. This has to stop. I think men understand that, and there are many of them here with us - welcome!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Marcus Smart unhappy with Pepsi Center security after fan allegedly told him to 'get on your knees'  Link to Image The NBA is investigating an incident between Boston guard Marcus Smart and a fan in Denver, after the Celtics guard said he heard a derogatory comment and was unhappy with the way that he believed security in the arena responded to the matter. Smart said a fan told him to ""get on your knees"" after he pursued a loose ball along the sideline during Friday's game in Denver. Smart said one of his feet got tangled in the frame of a courtside chair, and while he was trying to free himself when he heard the comment. FULL TEXT NBA spokesman Tim Frank said Saturday the league is investigating the matter. ""The fan told me, 'That's right, stay on the ground, get on your knees,'"" Smart told reporters postgame Friday night. ""Excuse me? I just told him, 'Listen, just watch the game because if we retaliate to you guys and if we were on the street, I guarantee you wouldn't say that."" Smart said security at Denver's Pepsi Center essentially ignored him. At least one security guard was seen speaking to fans in that section moments after the fourth-quarter incident, but it was unclear if any further action was taken. ""I told them who it was,"" Smart said. ""They just looked at him and didn't even say anything to him, didn't even get him out of the game. Probably if I was a superstar, they probably would have did something but it is what it is. We're going to end up protecting ourselves eventually and it's not going to be pretty for those fans and we don't want that. The league doesn't want that."" The incident is just the latest in several derogatory exchanges that have caught the NBA's attention in recent months. Russell Westbrook, DeMarcus Cousins, Kyle Lowry and others were involved in such incidents last seasons, prompting the NBA to say that it wants arena security personnel to have zero tolerance for abusive or hateful behavior. Last season, Westbrook and Cousins were subjected to racist taunts in Salt Lake City and Boston and the fans involved in those incidents were banned by the Jazz and Celtics. Lowry was shoved by a minority partner of the Golden State Warriors' ownership group, seated courtside during the NBA Finals, and that person was banned from team business for a year by the league. The league has not released exact numbers of how many fans have been ejected for such incidents. But after a number of players met with the NBA this past offseason to air their concerns about safety and fan behavior, the league expanded the area in arenas most closely monitored when it comes to player-fan interaction. The top-priority area used to be just those seated with feet on the court itself or maybe the first couple rows of courtside seats; now, that area goes several rows deep in every building, plus the areas where teams and referees enter and exit the court. ""That's a problem in the league that we've got to fix,"" Smart said. ""If we retaliate to protect ourselves, we're the ones getting in trouble. They're not. And that's not right. ... There's nowhere in this league for it."" This is not the first incident between Smart and a fan. In 2014, when he was playing for Oklahoma State, Smart was suspended three games for shoving a Texas Tech fan after a play where he crashed into some baseline seats following a blocked shot. Smart got up, then turned around and exchanged words with the fan before giving him a two-handed shove. Smart later apologized, and said it was ""a lesson I'll have to learn from.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Super Markstrom helps Canucks to shootout win over Capitals  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - Vancouver coach Travis Green stayed with Jacob Markstrom after a tough loss, and it paid off. Markstrom stopped 32 shots and then denied seven more during an extended shootout, helping the Canucks beat the Washington Capitals 2-1 on Saturday. Markstrom was in net for Vancouver's 6-1 loss at Dallas on Tuesday in the opener of a six-game strip. Rather than opt for Thatcher Demko two days later in Nashville, Green stayed with Markstrom, who made 45 saves in a 6-3 win. He followed that victory with another strong showing against the NHL-leading Capitals. ""We debated a little bit,"" Green said. ""I think we wanted to show him some confidence as well, get him back in the net right away. And he's given us two big games after that."" Elias Pettersson scored his 10th goal for Vancouver, which earned its second straight win since a stretch of seven losses in eight games. It was the Canucks' 12th power-play goal in their last seven games. Bo Horvat scored the decisive goal in the seventh round of the shootout, completing Vancouver's first win while scoring two times or fewer. ""We've been talking about, sometimes it's not going to be 5-3 ... or what not,"" Markstrom said. ""It's going to be 1-0 or 2-1. And it's nice to win one of those."" Washington managed just one goal for the second straight game and third time this season despite Vancouver losing defenseman Alexander Edler to an upper-body injury. Green declined to provide an update on Edler after the game. Jakub Vrana scored his 11th goal for the Capitals, and Braden Holtby made 32 saves. ""You play the game that's presented to you and lately obviously we've been playing a few more lower-scoring games,"" Holtby said. ""We're trying to get better defensively and just finding ways how to create offense while doing that too and that's this time of year where it's cat and mouse trying to find your best game."" Washington thought it had taken the lead in the shootout on Lars Eller's attempt in the fifth round. Originally credited as a goal, it was overturned after replays showed Eller's shot striking Markstrom's leg and then the post, but never crossing the goal line. Even the goalie was fooled. ""I usually listen to the referees, and he pointed to the net, and I thought it was a goal,"" Markstrom said. ""And then it wasn't."" Vrana put Washington in front with a one-timer 2:22 into the game after Eller dug the puck off the boards to set him up. Pettersson responded with six minutes left in the first, ripping another one-timer past Holtby's glove side on a 5-on-3 power play during which defenseman Michal Kempny lost his stick. The Canucks had a power-play chance in overtime after Evgeny Kuznetsov hooked Christopher Tanev, but Holtby denied Quinn Hughes and J.T. Miller. On the other end, Markstrom twice stood up Alex Ovechkin inside the final minute of overtime. ""I thought this was a real gutty win by our team,"" Green said. ""It's one thing to beat a team when you score four or five goals. But to push this game the way both goalies were playing, it was a nice win."" NOTES: Canucks C Jay Beagle (lower body) sat out again after missing three games earlier this month. ... Washington conceded five or more penalties for the first time since Nov. 7. ... The Canucks improved to 3-1 in the shootout this season while the Capitals sank to 3-2. UP NEXT Canucks: At Philadelphia on Monday.

"No. 16 Auburn cruises by Samford 52-0  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - Auburn's defense held Samford to 114 yards and forced four turnovers, JaTarvious Whitlow scored twice, and the No. 16 Tigers tuned up for the Iron Bowl with a 52-0 victory Saturday at rain-drenched Jordan-Hare Stadium. Auburn forced and recovered a fumble on a fourth-and-4 on Samford's opening drive, the first of three turnovers and a trio of three-and-outs across Samford's first six possessions. For the game, the Tigers also had 13 tackles for loss and held Samford to 2 yards per play, 2 of 13 on third down as Auburn's defensive starters were benched a few minutes into the third quarter. Samford had scored in 213 straight games. ""I think if they are in any other division they're probably in the top five,"" Samford head coach Chris Hatcher said. ""That defensive front they have is phenomenal. They've got a great quarterback and some great skill players to go along with him. All in all, we just played a team that was a lot better than us."" As the rain increased, so, too, did Auburn's offensive production. After a seven-point first quarter in which they struggled to convert third downs and had a 43-yard field goal blocked, the Tigers had 193 yards of offense and 24 points in the second. Whitlow and D.J. Williams accounted for 130 yards from scrimmage in the first half and Williams added his second touchdown of the season in the third quarter. The Tigers nearly eclipsed 300 rushing yards for the second time this season, finishing with 294 and four rushing scores. ""We knew it was going to rain,"" Auburn receiver Seth Williams said. ""We knew it wasn't going to be the best conditions. But we approached it right."" After completing 15 of 23 passes for 150 yards and a score, Bo Nix's day also was done early in the third quarter. That allowed 24-year-old redshirt freshman Cord Sandberg, a former member of the Philadelphia Phillies minor league baseball organization, to take the majority of second-half snaps under center. Sandberg made the most of his first appearance of the year, accounting for 115 yards from scrimmage and throwing the first two TD passes of his Auburn career - both to junior college transfer Zach Farrar. NIXED RECORDS With a 10-yard touchdown pass to Harold Joiner in the second quarter that put Auburn up 21-0, Nix passed Stan White for the most completions (181) and tied him for the most touchdowns (14) by a freshman quarterback in program history. Nix needs 50 passing yards and a touchdown in Auburn's final two games to break White's single-season marks from 1990 in both categories. CARLSON'S STRUGGLES Auburn sophomore kicker Anders Carlson had a 43-yard field goal blocked in the first quarter. The younger brother of SEC all-time leading scorer Daniel Carlson is now 9 for 25 on kicks of more than 40 yards in his Auburn career. IRON BOWL QUESTIONS Auburn is facing uncertainty at two key positions heading into the 83rd Iron Bowl. Reserve safety Jamien Sherwood, who has 25 tackles, three pass breakups, four tackles for loss and two quarterback hurries over the past five games will miss the first half against the Crimson Tide after being ejected for targeting in the third quarter against Samford. Additionally, Auburn started Kaleb Kim, who lost his starting job at center three weeks ago, at right guard over Mike Horton, the usual first-teamer at that spot. However, when Kim was injured in the second quarter, freshman Jalil Irvin filled in for him instead of Horton. Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said postgame that Horton suffered a minor injury last week and is expected to be ""fine"" to start against Alabama. UP NEXT Samford's regular season ends at 5-7. It's not expected to make the FCS playoff field. Auburn hosts Alabama in the Iron Bowl next Saturday. The Tigers are looking to win their third of the last four matchups played in Jordan-Hare Stadium. ""We've got the Iron Bowl at home,"" Malzahn said.

"15 thoughts as the Celtics return from their five-game road trip  Link to Image The Celtics concluded their grueling five-game West Coast swing with a 2-3 record following Friday's 96-92 loss to the Nuggets in Denver. Here are 15 thoughts about the trip: ""  The optimist's take: The Celtics played quite well without one of their top players, Gordon Hayward, they nearly took out one of the West's top teams without Hayward and Kemba Walker, and they were a Marcus Smart roll and another bounce or two away from beating both the Kings and Clippers. ""  The pessimist's take: Their only wins were an uninspiring close call against the Warriors, who might be the worst team in the NBA, and the Suns, who were missing their starting point guard (Ricky Rubio) and center (DeAndre Ayton). FULL TEXT ""  The results aside, the best news the Celtics received during the trip was that the head injury Walker suffered against the Nuggets is not considered serious. He plowed into Semi Ojeleye headfirst, collapsed to the ground, and was almost motionless, and the reaction of those around him indicated the possible severity of the situation. But Walker is expected to be fine, and according to one team source may not have even suffered a concussion, although he will likely have to go through the league-mandated concussion protocol because he initially experienced some concussion-like symptoms. ""  Brad Wanamaker's ascension has been the Celtics' most pleasant surprise over the first 15 games. He is getting more playing time since Hayward's injury, and has stepped in and become one of Boston's most trusted and reliable options, even in critical moments. In the seven games since Hayward was hurt, Wanamaker is averaging 10.7 points, 4 assists, and 2.1 rebounds while shooting 53.5 percent from the field and making 25 of 26 free throws. ""He's been one of our best players on the trip, bench or starters,"" coach Brad Stevens said. ""He's been one of our best players and he really gave us a chance [against Denver]."" ""  The Celtics battled in the loss to the Nuggets after Walker went down with his injury. But it was also quite clear that Denver almost completely removed its foot from the gas pedal after it soared to a 19-point lead with less than 15 minutes left. The Celtics deserve credit for their resilience, but the Nuggets flipped the switch back when they needed to. ""  We interrupt this regularly scheduled Celtics chatter to inform you that Kyrie Irving will not be coming to Boston when the Nets face the Celtics on Wednesday. He is sidelined with a shoulder issue, but this news quickly generated a collective eye roll across New England. ""  Smart looked like he'd just been through a prizefight as he limped out of the locker room on Friday night. He is dealing with a sore ankle and probably a sore everything else, but that never stopped him from throwing his body around like the court was made with sponges instead of hardwood. Smart was responsible for the signature defensive play of the trip, when he batted the ball away from Clippers star Kawhi Leonard, then sprawled across the floor to grab the loose ball and fire it off of Leonard's leg, giving Boston a chance late in Wednesday's game. ""  Speaking of Smart, he was also involved in an altercation with a fan during the Nuggets game. It was sparked - unsurprisingly - by Smart hurtling his body into the stands to chase a loose ball. He said that his foot got stuck in a chair, and a fan there told him to stay on the ground and get on his knees. ""I just told him, 'Listen, just watch the game,' because, if we retaliate to you guys, or we were on the street, you probably wouldn't say that,' "" Smart said. "" 'I guarantee you wouldn't say that because we're grown men just like you.' "" Smart was upset about the incident, but especially frustrated that arena security did not appear to do anything. ""We're going to end up protecting ourselves eventually,"" Smart said, ""and it's not going to be pretty for the fan, and we don't want that."" ""  Despite the 2-3 record that followed their 10-game win streak, the Celtics have done enough to make it clear they will be a very good team this season. It does still seem like they're one piece away from being a potentially great team, but the problem is there's no clear answer about what that piece might be, and how it could be acquired. The team's rookies have not done enough to become enticing trade pieces, and the Celtics' center-by-committee of Daniel Theis, Robert Williams, and Enes Kanter has actually played quite well. The good news for Danny Ainge is that he has three months until the trade deadline, and he still has some future draft assets to play with if he wants. ""  Having said that, Hayward's presence sure would have helped over these last five games. ""  Jayson Tatum is taking on a larger workload this season following the departures of Irving and Al Horford. His usage rate has spiked from 22.1 percent last season to 27.3 this year, and he is attempting 5.3 more shots per game. As a result, there will be times when Tatum takes tougher shots against tougher defenders, but he would still like to be a bit more efficient. He is shooting 40.9 percent overall, 37.1 percent on 3-pointers, and 79.3 percent from the foul line, which would all be career lows. ""  It is becoming increasingly apparent how much Stevens enjoys coaching this team. It is a return to the hard-playing, scrappy groups that defined the pre-Irving era, and there is once again a sense that this team will not quit, no matter the deficit. After Friday's near-miss comeback, Stevens called the veterans ""warriors"" multiple times. Those are the kinds of players he wants to coach. ""  Grant Williams's 3-point misses are now becoming a thing. He is 0 for 19 this season. Teams are often leaving him wide open behind the line, as the Nuggets did twice in Friday's game. Williams was a below-average 3-point shooter at Tennessee, but he had shown promise from beyond the NBA arc during summer league and the preseason. Plenty of his line-drive shots have missed badly, and it seems it's more of a mental hurdle he'll have to clear. He said he is confident that he will. ""  Entering Saturday night's action, the Celtics, Heat, 76ers, and Raptors were all still undefeated at home, with a combined record of 23-0. ""  Peyton Manning was at Friday's game in Denver. During a timeout he tossed a pass to the team's fluffy mascot and it fell incomplete, bolstering Tom Brady's case as the best there ever was.

"They grew up at the Boston Children's Theatre. Now they look back with alarm  Link to Image An invitation to join Burgess Clark's private advanced acting class at the Boston Children's Theatre meant you were going places. Clark, the theater's esteemed director since 2008, handpicked the 15 or so students he wanted in the class and made it clear he considered them the crème de la crème. Many of the teenagers were thrilled to be chosen. The group Clark ran could feel like a family: intensely close, competitive, affectionate, and secretive. Only years later did some former students begin to think more critically about what, exactly, had transpired in those acting classes and in private lessons with Clark. FULL TEXT ""I didn't really notice it until I had already graduated,"" said Jake Wetmore, 20, a former BCT student now studying musical theater in Los Angeles. ""I would think back on things that happened in my acting classes, and I would think, that's not something that should be happening."" As adults with distance from the program and new insight from the #MeToo movement, the Children's Theatre alums found that certain aspects of that coveted class didn't sit right anymore, including the uncomfortable intimacy between Clark and his students; the strange exercises that sometimes ended with teenagers sprawled on top of each other or shouting insults at their classmates; the intense personal sharing that left many students shaking and crying; the emphasis on secrecy; and the rarity of doing what is traditional in most acting classes: using scripts. Wetmore began to talk to other graduates; they checked their reactions against each other. ""We would be like, 'That was weird, right?' "" he said. He was among a group of 17 former students who sent a letter to the theater's board late last month, detailing a range of negative experiences with Clark; three alleged that Clark had kissed or touched them inappropriately. Beverly police are investigating; no charges have been filed. A group of older alums sent a second letter describing their own disturbing encounters. Clark has resigned, and Toby Schine, BCT's executive director, who was not accused of misconduct, left last week. The theater also cut ties with Clark's partner, Daniel Blake, after the Globe found that he and Clark had been reprimanded for their behavior with students at a youth arts camp in Colorado (there was no evidence of criminal conduct). None of the three men responded to multiple requests for comment. BCT's board president, Jim Solomon, said he had no idea what had been going on in the acting classes until the students lodged their complaints. Clark ""did get people to really reach down deep into themselves"" and tap into their emotions, Solomon said. ""However, I think that his M.O. might have been that he takes vulnerable children, he tears them down, and then he builds them back up. So they're left craving his adulation and admiration."" He added, ""Anything that pushes romantic or sexual themes, to me, there's really no place for."" When students received an invitation from Clark to be part of his ""Actor's Core"" class, many said they were elated. ""When he invited me to it, I just felt on top of the world,"" said Megan McMahon, who was in the private class from 2011 to 2013 and later worked at the theater. The elite students starred in productions each season; for them, BCT was an all-encompassing world. Clark's classes usually began with students sitting in a circle on the floor of a classroom at the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology in the South End and sharing personal stories about themselves. The prompts ranged, former students said, from relatively light queries to uncomfortably intimate questions. ""I have a vivid memory of us all sitting in a circle and holding hands,"" said Jess Marlor, a composer and educator in New York who was part of the theater from 2009 to 2011. She recalled Burgess telling the students to share a secret they had never shared with anyone else. ""It can't be something simple,"" she remembered him saying. ""It has to be something that touches your core."" Marlor said students talked about sexual assault and suicidal thoughts; soon many of them were crying. She remembers being frightened. Other students described circles in which they were asked to discuss the worst thing that anyone had ever said to them or in which they discussed sexual traumas. In classes with college students and adults, difficult stories do come up, said Deb Margolin, a professor of playwriting and acting at Yale. But students guide the way and can dictate the level of disclosure, choosing what to share in open-ended exercises. ""Theater is about the revelation of humanity. And I know no other way than a very personal approach,"" Margolin said. But, she said, that puts an important responsibility on educators ""to be clinical and to treat people's boundaries with respect."" And working with children, who may not feel able to push back, requires even more care. ""It's incredibly reckless and irresponsible to ask them to divulge information that I have no way of guiding them through,"" said Amanda Kibler, the education director at The Coterie theater in Kansas City. Kibler pointed out that although acting can feel therapeutic, most acting teachers are not licensed therapists. When students begin to share very personal information with her, she stops them and asks them to take a deep breath instead. A different tone was set at the Boston Children's Theatre. There, between classes, students would brainstorm ""risky questions"" to ask specific peers at the next class and send them to Clark over Facebook Messenger (the Globe reviewed screenshots of some of those conversations). ""What is the root of your eating disorder?"" one student suggested asking another in a Facebook message to Clark. Clark prized what he viewed as emotional risk-taking, claiming it would help students become better actors. He would often ask students, who were mostly between 14 and 18 years old, about their sex lives, alums said. ""Within the class, he would ask questions about virginity, if you'd have sex, if you're comfortable with sex, how does sex affect your art?"" Wetmore said. Students weren't obligated to share, ""but the energy of the room and what he celebrated was people one-upping each other."" One student, who requested anonymity, said Clark asked him during a private acting lesson if he masturbated and what he did in his sexual fantasies. He was 15 at the time. The boy's mother confirmed to the Globe that her son told her about the lessons around two years after they happened. Clark told members of the acting class that they shouldn't disclose what happened during the sessions to people outside the room, including family and friends, according to several former students, because they were sharing such personal stories. Alongside standard improvisational games, Clark sometimes facilitated a darker kind of spontaneity. During one session in April 2011, Clark encouraged the class to call each other names like ""slut"" and ""skank,"" some former students said. Tensions escalated, and the exercise culminated in students shoving and pushing each other, but Clark didn't intervene, they said. Futaba Shioda, who was in Clark's acting class that day, said the exercise was framed by Clark as a way to explore bullying behaviors. ""I wanted to opt out,"" said Shioda, now an actor in New York City. ""I remember there was no place to go."" McMahon, who is now 25, said both Clark and Blake ""were very involved in our romantic and sex lives."" She recalled telling Blake that she had feelings for another girl in the class; Blake, she said, told her that bisexuality wasn't real and that she must be gay, which she took as a fact. McMahon's mother, Laura McMahon, said the family had ""moved heaven and earth"" so that Megan could get the kind of theater training that BCT promised. ""When a parent entrusts their child to someone else, you give up your power,"" Laura McMahon said in a recent interview. ""I wake up every morning a different kind of mad about it."" Other elements of the acting class seemed designed to provoke interpersonal drama in the teenagers' lives. Teresa Gelsomini, who is now 21 and studying acting at Ithaca College, recalled Clark asking his students to write down what they thought about other people in the class; Clark then read aloud the comments, some of which were hurtful, one by one. ""The amount of manipulation was crazy,"" Gelsomini said. In hindsight, she said, the students' passion for theater made them more vulnerable; they would have done anything to be actors. Many, like Gelsomini, are pursuing theater professionally, and it has been difficult to reconcile their past devotion to BCT with the sense that Clark took advantage of them.  ""That place, even though a lot of messed up things happened, it's still a really big part of my teenage years,"" Gelsomini said. ""Doing theater classes really brought me an insane amount of joy."" Clark also praised students for taking physical risks in exercises that sometimes ended with teenagers intertwined. ""The way that [the exercises] always progressed was very sexual. People would be on top of each other, really intimate positions,"" said Wetmore. It wasn't until he graduated and went to acting school that he realized those exercises weren't common in conventional acting classes. Like many of the former students who spent years at the Boston Children's Theatre and like many of the parents who trusted the adults in charge, Wetmore felt betrayed. ""I thought it was helping my acting,"" he said. ""I was under the impression that these were really specific things that were designed for advanced actors.""

"Iowa woman gets 50 years in prison for 1992 beating death  Link to Image MUSCATINE, Iowa (AP) - An Iowa grandmother convicted of the 1992 killing of her former boyfriend has been sentenced to 50 years in prison, which was the maximum allowed. The Muscatine Journal reports that 56-year-old Annette Cahill showed no emotion when she was sentenced Friday. Following a mistrial earlier this year, Cahill was convicted in September of second-degree murder in the baseball bat beating death of 22-year-old bartender Corey Wieneke. Her attorney says she plans to appeal. Police have said Cahill had been in an intimate relationship with Wieneke and that they had a heated argument about his involvement with another woman. Wieneke was found dead on the floor of his bedroom in rural West Liberty in October 1992. The case against Cahill relied on testimony from a woman who said she was 9 years old when she overheard Cahill confess to killing Wieneke. ___ Information from: Muscatine Journal, http://www.muscatinejournal.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Inside the Walmart of Weed: from rural Canada, Big Marijuana seeks to dominate global market  Link to Image SMITHS FALLS, Ontario - The skunky, floral smell of growing marijuana is everywhere, from the parking lot outside the cavernous warehouse, to the lobby, even inside the coffee nook where employees take a break. The building itself is a chocolate brown box that once housed a Hershey's candy factory. In just one wing, a labyrinth of white halls links seemingly endless rows of windowless rooms, some the size of a school gymnasium, with fields of cannabis inside growing under bright white and yellow lights. Workers wheel carts piled high with bales of green buds. In large open-floor production rooms, assembly lines of machinery pump out pot products, scores of perfectly rolled joints from the silver fingers of one, slews of red pills for medical marijuana patients in Germany spilling from another. Welcome to the Walmart of Weed. FULL TEXT With Canada the largest nation to completely legalize marijuana, the world's most valuable pot company, Canopy Growth Corp., has set up shop in this rural town seven hours northwest of Boston. Founded in 2013 and now worth about $6.4 billion, Canopy is one of the most watched and most controversial pot companies, the embodiment of Big Marijuana that critics contend uses size, market power, and lobbying prowess to accelerate the loosening of cannabis laws around the world and shoulder out competitors and smaller businesses. ""We're seen as 'corporate cannabis,' the big kid on the block,"" said D'Arcy McDonell, a Canopy spokesman, as he conducted a tour of the factory earlier this year. ""What makes it corporate cannabis? Success, basically."" Already Big Alcohol, Big Tobacco, and Big Pharma have bought their way into Canopy and other marijuana companies. And, like those longstanding giants, the new cannabis corporations are spending millions of dollars lobbying for laws that let them sell large volumes of potentially addictive products. Even in the Holy Land of marijuana - Jamaica - Canopy and other Canadian companies have contracted with local businesses to gain a foothold in the nation's new medical market, anticipating a day when they can export ganja from the home of Bob Marley, while small traditional cannabis farmers are struggling to meet regulatory requirements. ""We're seeing almost exactly the same thing"" with marijuana as with tobacco and alcohol, said Dr. Sharon Levy, who runs the adolescent substance use program at Boston Children's Hospital. ""Honestly, at what point do we say, 'We're not going to allow people to get rich on the health of other people?' "" As with cigarettes, advertising for marijuana is sharply limited in Canada and the United States. But pot companies have found ways around such rules using sleek videos on social media. Canopy, for example, has announced ventures with celebrities Drake, Seth Rogen, Martha Stewart, and Snoop Dogg. Its new line with Drake was promoted on the rapper's Instagram page, which has nearly 62 million followers. Massachusetts has tried to limit corporate domination in the pot business. But as the Globe Spotlight Team reported earlier this year, some bigger pot operators have            tried to skirt the state's cap on licenses and exploit the mandate to foster a diverse industry by recruiting minority entrepreneurs to serve as the local face of the company while              maintaining substantial control over the businesses. Companies have            also hired former politicians and consultants to help them win coveted permits from municipalities.  Canopy executives say the nascent marijuana market has room for all types of businesses, while insisting its size is an asset: The company can produce enough marijuana to meet the growing demand at prices that keep consumers from buying on illicit markets - a crucial need for legalization to succeed; it also has the wherewithal to impose the tight quality and security controls governments require of a regulated drug. ""There's a lot of good things we can do with our scale and our size,"" Canopy chief executive Mark Zekulin said. As countries around the world loosen medical cannabis laws - with global consumer spending on legal pot projected to hit $40 billion by 2024 - the jockeying for primacy in this growing industry is largely among a handful of large Canadian companies. In recent years, Canopy started exporting medical marijuana to Germany and Australia, and is building a hub in Denmark to supply Europe. The company also has operations in Colombia, Brazil, and southern Africa. And this year, Canopyinked a $3.4 billion deal to buy one of the biggest US pot companies, Acreage Holdings, whose            board includes former House speaker John Boehner and ex-Massachusetts governor William Weld. The deal hinges on changes to US law easing marijuana restrictions. While recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states, to date federal law has limited the size of pot companies by hampering access to financial markets and cross-state commerce. But that is poised to change. The US House of Representatives recently passed a cannabis banking bill, which, if signed into law, would likely allow Big Marijuana companies to explode in the United States. Many policy analysts say the US has to find a better way to regulate potentially addictive products to avoid repeating the market consolidation and public health issues associated with tobacco, alcohol, and addictive pharmaceuticals. ""This isn't about saying, 'We need to smash capitalism'; it's about mitigating the excesses of corporate capitalism,"" said Steve Rolles, a London-based policy analyst with Transform Drug Policy Foundation, who advised Canada on marijuana regulation. ""Emerging cannabis markets could be a really great opportunity to show how we could build new markets to serve the public interest and not allow these harms. In five to 10 years, that boat will have sailed."" Public health concerns One of Canopy's newest innovations is the creation of branded pot-infused beverages - such as a ginger ale drink - that have recently become legal in Canada and are expected to hit licensed stores there in mid-December. The effort benefited from the expertise of Constellation Brands, a conglomerate that owns Corona beer, Svedka vodka, Robert Mondavi wines, and other popular alcohol brands. Constellationinvested $4 billion in Canopy in 2018, giving it 38 percent of the company and            four seats on its seven-member board. Constellation ""saved us decades of knowledge-gathering,"" said Mario Castillo, Canopy's eastern Canada regional manager. Meanwhile, Cronos, another Canadian cannabis company, received a $1.8 billion investment last year from Altria Group, maker of Marlboro and other cigarette brands, giving the tobacco giant a 45 percent stake in the pot company. Both tobacco and marijuana industries see potential in vaping technologies that can appeal to both consumers and regulators, especially given the recent concern over vaping-related lung illnesses. Public health advocates fear such partnerships will inevitably follow a harmful playbook. Levy, the Boston Children's Hospital pediatrician, co-wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine that she expects marijuana companies to follow a roadmap drawn up by the tobacco industry: ""deny addiction potential, downplay known adverse health effects, create as large a market as possible as quickly as possible, and protect that market through lobbying, campaign contributions, and other advocacy efforts."" As with alcohol and tobacco, marijuana companies' revenues rely on heavy consumption from regular users: Daily and near-daily cannabis consumers account for 75 percent of spending in the industry, a 2016 study in the Journal of Drug Issues found. That dynamic incentivizes companies to create more potent and more addictive products, such as ""dabs,"" waxy clumps of highly concentrated marijuana that are often smoked with a blowtorch-like device, and are popular with teenagers, Levy said. Federal drug laws have long prevented funding well-designed studies on marijuana. Now, cannabis companies are paying for research they hope will demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of their products, raising questions about conflicts of interest tainting supposedly unbiased scientific inquiry. What scientists do know: Cannabis can be addictive, though less so than alcohol, cigarettes, and opioids. Frequent pot use can affect memory, motivation, and cognitive functioning. Heavy use of high-potency marijuana has been            linked to psychosis in studies, though it's            unclear why. On the other hand, cannabis can provide medical relief for people with such conditions as epilepsy, cancer, and chronic pain. Most US states that have legalized pot - such as Massachusetts - have chosen for-profit models through ballot initiatives, said Beau Kilmer, director of the RAND Drug Policy Research Center. That's unfortunate, he said, because it limits voters to a ""yes"" or ""no"" choice on legalization generally, without understanding how it will be implemented and the range of possible alternatives. Options that could lead to better health results than the for-profit model, Kilmer said: government-run stores, such as those implemented in some Canadian jurisdictions, or requiring cannabis producers to be nonprofits or to follow rules for socially responsible corporations. ""If you talk to folks who are pro-legalization outside of the United States,"" Kilmer said, ""they look at the US and say, 'Why are you allowing the big companies to control this?' "" Social justice Canopy has hired inventors and engineers, and filed for hundreds of patents for its products and processing equipment. One machine, for example, can do the work of nine people checking the weight and packaging of jars of marijuana. These efficiencies are one example of how large corporations can outmuscle smaller competitors. This has implications for a big ambition of marijuana advocates - that legalization would benefit black and Hispanic communities that were targeted during the war on drugs, a cornerstone of Massachusetts' legalization law. The state has taken steps to help locals start pot businesses, but Kilmer questions their long-term prospects. If the United States legalizes cannabis across state borders, the bigger companies by dint of their reach would have access to many more markets, he said, and could further undercut local operations by growing pot at scale in warmer climes at lower cost, taking the jobs there with them. Shaleen Title, a Massachusetts cannabis commissioner who helped craft the state's measures aimed at boosting small businesses, said it was important for government officials to avoid unnecessary ""fear-based policies,"" like requirements that marijuana businesses not locate near certain types of other businesses such as funeral homes, which can drive up real estate costs. ""Companies with unlimited resources love barriers to entry and requirements that demand large amounts of capital,"" Title said, ""because such requirements push others out and give the already-privileged a boost toward the market domination and market consolidation that they're seeking."" One of the Massachusetts measures she supported is a cap on each company of three licenses of each kind - retail, cultivation, or production, for example. Zekulin, the Canopy CEO, said the company expects to compete in those markets that have licensing limits by selling other retailers its branded and patented products for sleep, pain, and anxiety that are under development now. 'Cannabis colonialism' With Canada serving as a model for legalizing marijuana, Canopy has hosted tours for government officials from around the world, giving it an opportunity to pitch looser cannabis laws. That worries activists, who say the Canadian system has shut out smaller businesses. ""Canopy is going around telling every government on Earth, 'Do it like us, grow the plants in prison-like facilities with big walls and concrete, we know what we're doing, don't let in those little people,' "" said Jodie Emery, a Canadian marijuana activist. ""This reeks of cannabis colonialism."" In Colombia, Lesotho, and other countries, Canopy has acquired local companies or is contracting with them. Those investments, Canopy points out, have provided stable incomes and health insurance to locals who have never had such benefits. ""To us, it's inherent to always be giving back and always be locally committed,"" Zekulin said, adding the company is also working with researchers and doctors in those countries. But activists see such moves as the wealthy further enriching themselves off the poor. In Jamaica, where medical marijuana is legal and recreational smoking is decriminalized, small-scale cannabis farmers were ""hopelessly outgunned"" by the Canadian companies' lawyers and lobbyists looking to exploit the country's pot-paradise image, said Rolles, the analyst. ""I'm not naive enough to think cannabis can somehow smash the inequities of capitalism, but it is a blank slate,"" he said. ""If there's an opportunity to use emerging cannabis markets to build a fairer, more just, less iniquitous market structure, that's great. We have a responsibility to try to do it better.""

"Achiuwa scores 25, No. 16 Memphis holds off Ole Miss 87-86  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - The 16th-ranked Memphis Tigers already knew they would have to play a long stretch without James Wiseman, their top freshman. Then another freshman, Lester Quinones, went to the locker room with an undisclosed injury after playing less than nine minutes against Mississippi. Good thing coach Penny Hardaway has other a handful of very talented freshmen. Precious Achiuwa scored 25 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, while D.J. Jeffries added 23, including a dunk with a second left as Memphis held off the Rebels, 87-86, on Saturday for its third consecutive victory without Wiseman. ""To have a 16-point lead on a really well-coached team that has veteran guards and veteran players, I mean that's amazing for us,"" Hardaway said of this win. ""We will grow from this. We cannot go backward from this point forward with our energy and our understanding of what we're trying to do. But it's huge for us not to have Lester and James in there and be able to do that."" Blake Hinson beat the buzzer with a 3 for the final margin after Ole Miss (4-1) had trailed by as much as 16 in the second half. ""At the end, couldn't make a play when we needed to,"" Ole Miss coach Kermit Davis said. ""But good college game in November."" Memphis (5-1) snapped a three-game streak by Ole Miss in this series. Hardaway has the youngest team in the country, according to KenPom.com. He still has the No. 1 recruiting class even with Wiseman sitting out an NCAA-mandated 12-game suspension for what college sports' governing body ruled were impermissible benefits from 2017 when the Memphis coach was overseeing a local high school team. Achiuwa also was a five-star recruit like Wiseman. He helped Memphis score the final seven points to take 45-38 halftime lead. Then the 6-foot-9 forward scored the first seven for Memphis in the second half, then the Tigers pushed their lead to 54-43 on a dunk by Jeffries with 15:57 to go. The Tigers led 64-48 on a putback by Achiuwa with 11:19 left. ""The rest of the team just has to step up and make up for James not being here and not being able to play,"" Achiuwa said. Ole Miss responded with a 17-6 run to turn a runaway into a thrilling finish. With 5 seconds left and Memphis up 85-82, Breein Tyree thought he'd gotten a shot off when fouled by Tyler Harris. Officials sent Tyree to the line for two free throws instead of 3. Tyree split the free throws before Jeffries' dunk. ""It was kind of a bang-bang play,"" Davis said. Davis has three starters back for Ole Miss from his NCAA Tournament team last season. Tyree led Ole Miss with 24 points. KJ Buffen had a team-high 13 before fouling out with 10:10 left, and Hinson had 15. Harris had 15 and Alex Lomax 14 for Memphis. BIG PICTURE Ole Miss: The Rebels held each of their first four opponents below 60 points and led the SEC by allowing just 31.9% shooting, which was fourth nationally. They had little answer for Memphis' inside scoring except for getting into foul trouble. ... Their 3-pointers fell early as they hit five of their first six for an early lead. The Rebels finished 12 of 27 from 3. Memphis: The young Tigers are very good with layups and high-flying dunks, outscoring Ole Miss 52-20 in the paint. But they're going to have to show at some point they can take, and make, 3s to keep opponents from packing the paint defensively. They hit only 3 of 11 outside the arc, with Harris hitting all three. ACHUIWA'S GAME Hardaway says he had a long talk with Achiuwa on Friday with the freshman wanting to score more early this season. Against Ole Miss, Achiuwa came through with five defensive rebounds. He also had three turnovers but three steals and two blocks. ""I know who he could be and where he wants to go,"" Hardaway said. ""Where he wants to go, he has to do the things like he did today. He locked in and never took his eyes off of it from the beginning of the game until the end. It showed who he really is to the country.""

"Patriots linebacker Jamie Collins has all the right moves  FOXBOROUGH - Jamie Collins can make your jaw drop and eyes pop. Whether he's eyeing his target presnap or performing his latest acrobatic stunt, the Patriots linebacker is always someone to train your peepers on. Part Dick Butkus, part Gumby, and part Flying Wallenda, Collins is a leading force behind the NFL's best defense and he's also the leading entertainer at New England's practices. Whether it's a back flip off a blocking sled, walking on his hands during stretching, or jumping over the line of scrimmage from a standing position to block a punt, Collins is always pulling off head-shaking moves. He said the inspiration for many of his antics comes from childhood memories of messing around with his late brother Fred, whom he affectionately referred to as ""FC."" FULL TEXT ""Man, sometimes I'm just in my own little world and I just do stuff. I was taught a long time ago how to do a lot of those things by my brother,'' Collins said Friday. ""Whenever I get time or whenever I'm bored, I just do little stuff like that, man, it's kind of fun. I like to have fun. I had a lot of fun growing up. You know, I'm a country boy, so stuff like that, that's how we survived.'' Collins, who grew up in McCall Creek, Miss., explained there weren't as many entertainment options available back then, so they created their own. ""You had to find something to have fun. We played a lot of sports. We raced on feet, we wrassled, we slap boxed, we had to find anything to have fun, so that's what we did,'' Collins said. ""We had to keep busy, we didn't play any video games, we didn't have social media. So, we had to get outside and do something, we had to go outside and be active. It's just one of those things I loved doing. I loved tumbling, I loved doing stuff like that.'' Collins regularly catches teammates, staff, and opponents off guard with his moves - and he'll even surprise himself. ""Oh, yeah. For sure, for sure,'' he said. ""It's not something that I just practice, I just do it. I just go.'' Collins has also saved some of his most impressive feats for game action. He leads the Patriots with 47 tackles and a half-dozen sacks. The 6-foot-3-inch, 255-pounder also has three interceptions (including a pick-six), two forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery. His play through 10 games in his second stint in New England has thrust him into the conversation for defensive player of the year. ""I mean, it's pretty cool, man,'' said Collins. ""But that ain't nothing I'm harping on. I just put my head down and work, man, and whatever comes, comes. That's bigger than me. I just come in here every day and work and hope and pray for the best.'' Already armed with a solid base of knowledge from his three-plus seasons in the New England defense, Collins has thrived in his return. He said there's been some subtle scheme changes that have really made a difference for him. ""There's a lot of different stuff going on, you know, you don't do the same stuff every year,'' he said. ""That's football, man, you've got to adjust and adapt and do your best, that's what we get paid to do.'' Collins said this Patriots unit is the best defense he's ever been a part of, though they don't spend a lot of time thinking about their place in history. New England has allowed 108 points through 10 games. The record for fewest points allowed in a 16-game slate is 165. ""We can definitely be one [of the best] as long as we keep going and doing what we're doing, hopefully we can and we'll see in the end,'' said Collins. ""It's nothing that we're shooting for, but as long as you're out there having fun, hopefully everything will work itself out.'' He said by no means has this defense peaked. ""You know, we've got a lot of depth. We've got a lot of good players, a lot of smart players,'' Collins said. ""We've got a lot of guys that are committed to the details and everybody is committed to one another, they love playing for one another. As long as we keep the brotherhood going and the camaraderie going, I think we'll be pretty damn good.'' The Patriots' linebacking corps has become known as the ""Boogeymen,"" a moniker that Dont'a Hightower said Collins conjured up one day. Collins said he's not so sure. ""Honestly, we was at practice stretching one day. We were just talking noise, I think it was me, Dont'a, and [Jerod] Mayo - it might have been Mayo [that coined the phrase],'' said Collins. ""It was really just us BS-ing around. I don't even know. Somebody took it and ran with it, I don't even know."" The Boogeymen name has taken off, spawning signs, T-shirts, and sweat shirts everywhere the team goes. ""It has gotten pretty big. It's cool,"" said Collins. ""It's not something we planned on, it just happened. We definitely appreciate it, we're forever grateful.'' Along with being grateful, Collins said this season has been his happiest time as a pro. ""I'm always trying to be that way. I'm blessed. Doing something that I'm pretty sure millions of people would love to be doing,'' he said. ""I'm not mad at all. Definitely, definitely blessed.'' Collins and his fellow Boogeymen will be back in action on Sunday against the Cowboys when they'll try to put the brakes on Ezekiel Elliott, a scary man in his own right. ""Man, he's a great back. He's an every-down back. You don't get those guys often - he's very rare in this league. He's one of those guys,'' said Collins. ""He can catch the ball out of the backfield, he can run it up the middle, he can spin out wide and give you a route. With him, you've just got to be prepared for everything.''

"No. 2 Ohio State tested but tops No. 9 Penn State 28-17  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - J.K. Dobbins rushed for 157 yards and two touchdowns and No. 2 Ohio State locked up the Big Ten East title Saturday, surviving its first real test of the season with a 28-17 victory over No. 9 Penn State. The Buckeyes held on after Penn State (9-2, 7-2 Big Ten) took advantage of two second-half turnovers to climb back into the game in the third quarter after trailing 21-0. This was a far different scenario for Ohio State, which blew out its first 10 opponents. ""From the beginning to the end, you couldn't take a deep breath at all,"" Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. The Buckeyes (10-0, 8-0 Big Ten) were clinging to a 21-17 lead early in the fourth quarter when Justin Fields threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Chris Olave to create some space. The Ohio State defense, with Chase Young back from a two-game suspension, then shut down two late Penn State drives on fourth down. The last drive included back-to-back sacks of backup quarterback Will Levis by Young and linebacker Baron Browning. Fields fumbled away the ball twice, once as he was crossing the goal line for an apparent touchdown. But he got critical yards on the ground, rushing for 68 yards on 21 carries and threw beautiful second half touchdown passes to K.J. Hill and Olave. ""The biggest difference was the quarterback's legs, the running game,"" Penn State coach James Franklin said. Dobbins was responsible for both first-half touchdowns, a 4-yard plunge in the first quarter and a 2-yard plunge on fourth-and-goal with 2 minutes left in the half. He finished the first half with 89 rushing yards. With three sacks, Young now has 16.5 for the season. THE TAKEAWAY Penn State: Backup quarterback Levis provided a spark when he entered for the injured Sean Clifford, running for a 1-yard touchdown in the third quarter to pull his team within a touchdown. Statistically, the Nittany Lions were beaten soundly but managed to hang around until late. Journey Brown ran the ball 11 time for 64 yards. Ohio State: The Buckeyes outgained the Nittany Lions 417-227 but were stricken by uncharacteristic turnovers. POLL IMPLICATIONS Buckeyes should stay put. Nittany Lions could drop but not much after playing Ohio State tough. UP NEXT Penn State: Hosts Rutgers next Saturday in season finale.

"Aras Kaya's strike in OT lifts Winchester boys to Division 2 title  WORCESTER - For the the Winchester boys' soccer team, it was the culmination of a long, successful season that bled into overtime of the state championship. For Aras Kaya, it was the validation of years of steadfast work in and out of practice, striving to get to this moment at the pinnacle of high school athletics. FULL TEXT In an entertaining MIAA Division 2 boys' soccer final Saturday morning, Winchester pulled out a pulsating 5-4 overtime victory over Milford at Worcester State on a goal by Kaya off a re-start kick in the seventh minute of the first OT period. It was the program's first title since 1987. ""I worked so hard for this moment,"" said Kaya, an 18-year-old senior forward through tears after the game. ""I didn't even make the tryouts for two years. My junior year I had to really, really work hard to play. My junior year summer I just grinded it out and I just worked so hard to get that starting spot. ""And I finally did. I can't be more proud of this team."" Winchester coach Vin Musto said Kaya earned every bit of achievement. ""He's someone who just puts hours and hours into his craft outside of the team,"" Musto said. ""He's an absolute sponge of information. He made adjustments and found himself in the right place and it was a great finish. I couldn't be more proud."" Kaya finished off what was a balanced attack, with three players connecting for Winchester (15-3-5). Junior forward Diego Diaz scored twice, and senior midfielder William Hofheinz tallied two goals and an assist. ""From day one we said this is a complete team and we're never going to lean on one player,"" Musto said. ""It was total 80 minutes that everybody contributed. They could've crumbled and they stayed tough."" The game was certainly a mental test for both sides. Milford led two separate times and neither team ever led by more than one. The game featured nine total goals and the Sachems had to rebound from Milford tying the game with less than seven minutes left in regulation. Milford (18-1-2) received two goals from senior Pedro Araujo, one from junior Joao Pedro Da Silva, and the late tying goal from senior Leonardo Terrinha. ""This was the craziest game I've been a part of,"" Kaya said.

"Argentine bishop says he'll return to face sex allegations  Link to Image BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - An Argentine bishop close to Pope Francis said Saturday he'll return voluntarily to Argentina to respond to prosecutors' accusations of sex abuse. Javier Belda Iniesta, the canon law lawyer for Bishop Gustavo Zanchetta issued a statement that the monsignor would arrive in Argentina on Tuesday and would fully cooperate with authorities. Zanchetta has been formally accused of ""aggravated continuous sexual abuse"" of two seminarians, charges that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He has denied the charges. The Zanchetta case is particularly grave for Francis, given the pope was aware of allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by his onetime protégé in 2015, two years before Zanchetta resigned as bishop of Oran. Francis allowed him to step down in 2017 for ""health reasons,"" but then named him to a senior Vatican administration position a few months later. Francis acknowledged in a TV interview earlier this year that he asked Zanchetta about the initial accusation, involving nude selfies on the bishop's cellphone. The pope said he gave Zanchetta the benefit of the doubt after he claimed his phone had been hacked. Belda Iniesta stressed that judges had rejected requests by Argentine prosecutor María Soledad Filtrín for an international arrest warrant. He also insisted the bishop believes the prosecutor's actions were aimed only at learning the truth, ""even when they could seem compulsive or repetitive without apparent motive."" The Vatican insists the first accusation of actual sex abuse was only lodged against Zanchetta in late 2018. But The Associated Press and the newspaper Tribune of Salta have reported that documents and testimony from diocesan officials raised credible allegations of inappropriate sexual misconduct well before then. Zanchetta is also facing a canonical trial. The allegations do not involve minors. Argentine prosecutors said last week that an order for Zanchetta's capture had been requested because the bishop did not answer repeated phone calls or emails to be notified of the legal process against him. The attorney's statement Saturday said the bishop has been at the ""residence indicated to judicial authorities."" That appeared to confirm that Zanchetta has been lodging at the same Vatican hotel, the Santa Marta, at which the pope stays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No. 7 Virginia beats UMass 58-46 in Tip-Off tournament  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image UNCASVILLE, Conn. (AP) - Virginia wasn't hitting its long-range shots against Massachusetts and the Cavaliers' best player was on the bench for almost half of the game. But Braxton Key scored 16 points and Virginia used its stifling defense to hand UMass its first loss of the season, 58-46, on Saturday in the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament. Kihei Clark added 14 points and Jay Huff chipped in with 10 points and eight rebounds for the defending national champions (5-0), who limited the Minutemen to just 15 baskets and 30% shooting. ""We know we can be in any game with any team,"" Key said. ""We haven't found our rhythm yet shooting the ball this year. I don't think we've had a game where we shot the ball really well. But we're going to keep digging and keep playing defense really and we'll figure it out."" Carl Pierre had 14 points and T.J. Weeks added 12 for Massachusetts (5-1). UMass scored 11 straight points to close the first half and trailed just 29-24 at halftime after Tre Mitchell made layups on three straight trips down the court. They cut that deficit to three points after a short jumper from Pierre to open the second half. But the Cavaliers began double-teaming Mitchell, who scored all 10 of his points before intermission, and held UMass to four points over the next 14 minutes. ""In the second half, we challenged the guys and did a good job,"" coach Tony Bennett said. ""We put Braxton on Mitchell and Mamadi (Diakite) came quicker on the post trap. They did get some good open shots out of it, but I thought we tightened up for stretches and we were stingier defensively."" A dunk by Diakite on a lob from Clark highlighted the run that put Virginia in control at 49-33. Key had Virginia's first two baskets and 11 of his points in the first half. He also closed the scoring with a breakaway dunk. UMass tried to speed up the pace, opening the game with a trapping press. But the Minutemen made just three of their first 14 shots. ""Tonight, we just weren't hitting our shots, that's all it is,"" said Pierre, who was just 2 of 10 from 3-point range. ""We hit those shots, I think it's an interesting game. I definitely think we could have come out on top, too."" Diakite, who came in averaging just under 16 points a game, scored only four points in 21 minutes. He played three minutes in the first half, picking up his second foul 8½ minutes into the game and didn't score his first basket until eight minutes into the second half. But the 7-foot-1 Huff picked up the slack. He hit five of his eight shots. The Cavaliers' defense held UMass without a field goal for six minutes in the opening half. They led 29-13 after a 3-pointer from Casey Morsell, before UMass responded with its big run. STATS OF THE GAME. Massachusetts had just four assists for the game, while holding the Cavaliers to nine and neither team shot well from 3-point range. UMass made just 5 of its 26 shots from behind the arc. Virginia was 2 of 14. ""A couple of them may have been bad shots, but for the most part, we got open looks,"" UMass coach Matt McCall said. ""We have all the confidence in the world in our guys when the ball leaves their hands. (If we make them) now you look down at the stat sheet and we have 15, 16 assists instead of four."" Virginia outscored UMass in the paint 30-18. ILLNESS Virginia is playing this tournament without sophomore guard Kody Stattmann, who is back in Charlottesville with what Bennett described as a virus, which also kept him out of the victory over Vermont. ""We'll do his blood work and make sure it's going in the right direction and we can get him back sooner hopefully than later, but we're obviously going to let the doctors take good care of him,"" Bennett said. BIG PICTURE UMass: The Minutemen had scored at least 80 points in the past three games and came in averaging 78.4 points per game. Virginia: The Cavaliers have won the past six November tournaments they entered and are 137-36 in nonconference games under Bennett. UP NEXT UMass: The Minutemen will play St. John's in Sunday's third-place game. Virginia: The Cavaliers will play for the championship on Sunday against Arizona State, which beat the Red Storm 80-67. ""We're going to have to make shots,"" said St. John's coach Bobby Hurley. ""They're one of the best defensive teams in the country, and with their pace of play it's going to be a real contrast in style, obviously."" ___ More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and            https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"His White House engulfed, Trump keeps California in the crosshairs  Link to Image WASHINGTON - President Trump has never been one to dive into the details of policy, especially now, as an impeachment inquiry threatens to engulf his administration. In recent days, he has allowed his son-in-law to lead a major policy shift in the Middle East and has backed away from a high-profile promise to ban flavored e-cigarettes. But even as his presidency teeters, one of the few policy issues that has maintained Trump's personal focus is not one central to his political appeal, like immigration or trade. FULL TEXT It is the state of California. The state has been a political fixation since the early days of his presidency, but that was heightened this autumn. Trump has attended meetings, asked detailed questions at briefings, and pressed aides to find ways to use policies to go after the most populous state in the union, according to three people familiar with the matter. Aides say that Trump remains deeply involved on immigration policy, like a recent decision to slash the nation's refugee program nearly in half, and on trade. But they describe him as obsessed with narrow policies that directly affect California. Beyond those three policy matters, little else has penetrated the swirl of impeachment. Two Californians, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Adam B. Schiff, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, are leading the impeachment investigation. The state's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, has been unsparing in his criticism and his legal challenges. And the president's response appears to be personal. Beyond the name-calling - ""Shifty"" Adam Schiff and ""Nervous Nancy"" Pelosi - he has held California Democrats responsible even for the state's natural disasters. ""The Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, has done a terrible job of forest management,"" Trump wrote on Twitter this month, adding a threat: ""Every year, as the fire's rage & California burns, it is the same thing - and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor."" Newsom's ex-wife, Kimberly Guilfoyle, now a Trump campaign adviser and girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., has joined in the criticism on Twitter and at campaign events. And the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, has often counseled Trump on the politics of his state. In a statement, a White House spokesman, Judd Deere, said, ""California leaders continue to support destructive liberal policies that kill jobs, increase housing costs, provide sanctuary to criminal illegal aliens, and ignore longtime environmental issues."" Newsom appears to relish responding. ""We are the countervailing influence on climate change. We expose his folly,"" Newsom said in a recent interview. ""We embarrass him."" The cause of the recent bad blood appears to have been a secret deal that the governor brokered over the summer with Ford and three other major automakers, under which the companies agreed to comply with tighter climate pollution rules set by the state, defying Trump's national effort to roll back federal regulations on tailpipe emissions. The announcement of the deal enraged Trump, three people familiar with the matter say. Since the beginning of his presidency, Trump has been enthusiastic about his administration's push to roll back Obama-era rules on climate-warming auto pollution, framing it as a signature move to save an iconic industry from burdensome red tape. For most of that earlier period, Trump stayed away from the complex regulatory details involved in undoing the regulation, according to two current and two former White House officials. That changed with Newsom's deal with the automakers. Suddenly Trump was delving into policy details. The administration and Justice Department have pushed an unusual series of legal and policy moves against California and the auto companies that backed the state's climate change plan. Last month, the Justice Department filed suit to force the state to drop Quebec from its central effort to limit greenhouse gases from power plants, arguing that a state could not conduct foreign policy. In September, the Environmental Protection Agency threatened to withhold federal highway funding from California if it did not address a decadeslong backlog of air pollution control plans. Also in September, the administration opened an antitrust investigation into the four automakers that sided with California over Trump in the dispute over fuel efficiency standards. When aides told Trump that the final details of his rollback of the auto emissions rule would most likely not be completed before the end of this year, he demanded faster action. Officials at the EPA and the Department of Transportation responded by separating out California's portion of the rule and releasing it in September. Trump announced the new rule on Twitter while in Los Angeles for a fund-raiser. Then, Trump said aboard Air Force One that his administration would issue a notice of environmental violation against San Francisco because of its homelessness problem. Barry Rabe, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan who is writing a book about the history of the state-federal relationship, said there were no historical parallels for the president's obsession. ""I cannot think of another president who sustained a political jihad against a specific state,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"UK Labour Party leader Corbyn defends neutral Brexit stance  Link to Image Link to Image LONDON (AP) - Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is defending his decision to remain neutral in a possible future referendum on Britain's membership in the European Union. Corbyn said Saturday that he plans to be an ""honest broker"" in a Brexit referendum rather than urge voters to remain in the EU or leave under terms of a new deal he would negotiate if he becomes prime minister after the Dec. 12 election. He said at a campaign event in Sheffield that ""my role as the Labour prime minister would be to ensure that is carried out in a fair way ... and that I will carry out the result of that referendum."" Corbyn announced Friday night he would be neutral, a position assailed Saturday by political rivals on both sides of the Brexit divide. He had been repeatedly challenged by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to clarify his Brexit plan. Labour's position is more complex than the unabashedly pro-Brexit policy espoused by Johnson and his Conservatives, who seek to win parliamentary approval for the deal already negotiated in order to leave the EU by Jan. 31. Corbyn says if he comes to power, Labour will negotiate a new deal with EU officials, then put that new deal to voters, who can choose between endorsing it or staying inside the 28-nation EU bloc. He says he plans to let voters decide the proposed referendum without him taking a position as prime minister. That view was ridiculed on the campaign trail Saturday. Liberal Democratic leader Jo Swinson called it a total abdication of the prime minister's responsibility. Her party has vowed to halt Brexit by revoking Article 50, which triggered Britain's withdrawal process. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who advocates an immediate, final break with the EU, said the Labour Party is ""bombing"" with voters because of Corbyn's vague position. Johnson pushed for Britain to hold the December election, which is taking place more than two years early, in hopes of winning a majority and breaking Britain's political impasse over Brexit.

"Evans scores 3 TDs, No. 23 App State tops Texas State 35-13  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image BOONE, N.C. (AP) - Darrynton Evans ran for 154 yards and three second-half touchdowns and No. 23 Appalachian State avoided another home upset with a big second half to beat Texas State 35-13 on a rain-soaked Saturday. Zac Thomas threw for 174 yards and two touchdowns to help the Mountaineers (10-1, 6-1 Sun Belt) improve to 30-6 at home since becoming an FBS team in 2014. Texas State entered the game as a 30 1/2-point underdog, but trailed only 14-13 midway through the third quarter, and most fans at Kidd Brewer Stadium were probably thinking about Georgia Southern's 24-21 upset over then-20th-ranked Appalachian State three weeks ago on this same field. But linebacker Noel Cook turned the momentum when he intercepted a tipped pass in Texas State territory, setting up a 13-yard TD run around right end by Evans. Evans would add touchdown runs of 10 and 13 yards to give 14 TDs on the season to put the game away. Tyler Vitt threw for 154 yards and a touchdown for Texas State (3-8, 2-5). Thomas got the Mountaineers going early, connecting on a 45-yard TD strike down the middle to wide receiver Corey Sutton, who got a step on three defenders and stretched out to make an over-the-shoulder catch in the end zone. But Sutton, the team's leader in yards receiving and TDs receiving, left the game with a knee injury after fumbling in the second quarter and it seemed to take the Mountaineers a while to adjust. POLL IMPLICATIONS: A close win over Texas State isn't exactly going to impress the voters, but the Mountaineers still could potentially move up in the polls. Appalachian State was previously ranked No. 20 this season, its highest ranking ever. THE TAKEAWAY Texas State: This was a solid showing for the Bobcats for the first 2 1/2 quarters, particularly on defense against a Mountaineers team that came in ranked 21st in the country in scoring offense. But a penalty for illegal hands to the face nullified a third down stop, giving Appalachian State new life on offense. Appalachian State: The injury to Sutton could be problematic moving forward for the Mountaineers. Sutton was on the sideline in crutches after the game. The Mountaineers will have to rely more on Western Michigan graduate transfer Keishawn Watson, who had a 19-yard touchdown reception, his first with the school.

"Egypt unveils mummies of lion cubs, crocodiles, birds  Link to Image SAQQARA, Egypt - Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities on Saturday revealed details on recently discovered animal mummies, saying they include two lion cubs as well as several crocodiles, birds, and cats. FULL TEXT Items from the new find were displayed at a makeshift exhibition at the famed Step Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara, south of Cairo, near where mummies and other artifacts have been found in a vast necropolis. ""We are finding here hundreds of objects,"" said Antiquities Minister Khaled el-Anany. ""All of them are very interesting from the Egyptological point of view to know better this area."" The Saqqara plateau hosted at least 11 pyramids, including the Step Pyramid, along with hundreds of tombs of ancient officials, ranging from the 1st Dynasty (2920-2770 BC) to the Coptic period (395-642). Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters that local archaeologists found a cache that includes hundreds of mummified animals, birds, and crocodiles. He said that among the mummified animals were two lion cubs and radar scans were needed on three others to determine that the mummies were also lions. Archaeologists frequently find mummified cats but the recovery of a lion is rare. In 2004, the first lion skeleton was found in Saqqara, revealing the sacred status of the animal in ancient times. Archeologists also found wooden and bronze cat statues representing the ancient goddess Bastet and a rare large stone scarab, which Waziri described as ""the largest all over the world."" They also displayed two mummies of ichneumon, or the Egyptian mongoose, wrapped in linen bandages and wooden and tin-glazed statuettes of the goddess Sekhmet, represented as a woman with the head of a lioness. Scholars say Sekhmet (1390-1252 BC) was a goddess of war and the destroyer of the enemies of the sun god Re. There were also strips of papyrus with depictions of the goddess Taweret depicted as a hippopotamus with the tail of a crocodile. Markings on the displayed artifacts show that they date to the Late Period (664-332 BC). The Saqqara discovery is the latest in a series of new finds that Egypt has sought to publicize in an effort to revive its key tourism sector, which was badly hit by the turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nun, who is older than 70 and has not been publicly identified, had been living in a convent in southeastern France when she decided to retire in Haute-Saône, her native region farther north. FULL TEXT Her application to live in a unit in a publicly funded retirement home in Vesoul, a town about 55 miles northeast of Dijon, was accepted in July. But the home, which is run by the local authorities, specified that she would have to accommodate the other residents by not wearing her religious habit or veil. In a letter sent to the nun, and seen this week by the news outlet Agence France-Presse, the retirement home told her that ""all ostentatious signs of belonging to a religious community cannot be accepted in order to guarantee everyone's serenity."" ""Religion is a private matter and must remain so,"" the letter said. The nun did not agree to go without her habit, and the local parish helped her rent a private apartment instead. Officials now say that the retirement home wrongly applied France's secularism laws, and Alain Chrétien, the mayor of Vesoul, apologized in a statement Tuesday. ""This error of judgment is very regrettable,"" Chrétien said, adding that he was ""personally"" committed to finding the nun a spot in a public retirement home if she so wished. France has faced numerous heated debates over the place of religion in society in recent years, centered on the concept of laïcité, a policy of state secularism that first emerged during the French Revolution and took form in the 19th century, culminating in a landmark 1905 law on the separation of church and state. A cultural aversion to public expressions of all faiths still holds strong, but in recent years, it has focused on Muslim attire, especially women wearing head scarves. Recently, a local politician asked a Muslim mother on a school trip in Dijon to remove her hijab, igniting weeks of vitriolic nationwide debate. The nun's case had gone unnoticed until this week, when the Rev. Florent Belin, the parish priest in Vesoul, mentioned her in his monthly newsletter, lamenting that she had been forced to find her own apartment. ""People harp on with principles of laïcité that are not understood,"" Belin wrote. ""Old demons, mismanaged fears are blocking situations."" This week, Claude Ferry, the head of the public organization that manages the retirement home, told France Bleu, a network of local radio stations, that the nun had declined the spot in the home because she ""did not want to accept the rules, which are the same for everyone."" But French officials say those rules are a misguided use of France's national policy. Nicolas Cadène, a senior member of the Observatory of Secularism, an agency that helps the government enforce laïcité, said that France's religious neutrality restrictions applied only to state employees and other public servants on the job, not to the general public. Cadène said in a telephone interview that the nun's case was ""the very demonstration"" of a ""wrong interpretation of laïcité."" ""Under the rule of law, you don't ban something because it displeases this or that individual. You only ban it if it is objectively disturbing public order,"" he said. ""And that is obviously not the case when you have simple citizens who are wearing religious attire and who don't represent any public administrations."" Chrétien, the mayor of Vesoul, said in an interview published by the magazine Le Point on Wednesday that the retirement home's staff had committed a ""big blunder"" but that state employees were sometimes ""paralyzed"" when dealing with the ""inflammable"" issue of secularism. ""The topic is not consensual, because everyone has their own definition,"" he said. For Cadène, that is partly because debates over Muslims in France have led to a ""great confusion"" about secularism laws and have shifted public discourse toward a stricter understanding of laïcité. ""By constantly trying to extend neutrality, first by targeting a specific religion, it always winds up extending to other religions and beliefs,"" he said. ""It's a real danger.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"MIAA's playoff system means Thanksgiving Day rivalries don't matter as much as they used to  Link to Image It is supposed to be the football highlight of a high school senior's life. You invest a great part of your youth playing football and it culminates in the annual Thanksgiving Day game against a century-old rival. Morning football jousts give way to afternoon turkey, stuffing, and canned cranberry sauce. The rest of the country has Friday Night Lights. Here in Massachusetts we have Turkey Day bragging rights. Sweet. FULL TEXT But our ancient ritual has been modified and in many cases, severely diluted. This is not the fault of global warming, the Internet, or millennial apathy. The change in our traditional Thanksgiving football rivalry games is owed to changes in the MIAA state football playoff format. Massachusetts is home to most of the oldest football rivalries in High School America. And our jousts take place on Thanksgiving. Wellesley and Needham this week will play for the 132nd time, Barnstable and Falmouth for the 130th time, Winchester and Woburn for the 115th time. Swampscott and Marblehead have met 109 times. Ask anyone from Quincy if they think Quincy vs. North Quincy will be a big deal. Ditto for Boston Latin and Boston English, Newton North and Brookline. Unfortunately, playoff format changes imposed in 2013 have dented interest in the Thanksgiving game in many communities. Due to the current state playoff format, a 2019 Thanksgiving game might feature two teams who have already played this season; or worse: the Thanksgiving game can result in the farce if one squad decides not to compete because there's a Super Bowl coming up. Due to the current format, some teams have playoff games this weekend, five days before Thanksgiving. Which game would you try to win? ""We've played Foxborough 89 years in a row,'' says Mansfield coach Mike Redding, who is planning to go all out this Thursday even though his team is bound for a Division 2 Super Bowl. ""We want to be respectful, but you only get so many shots at a state championship. The good part for us is that we don't have to play the weekend before Thanksgiving. A lot of the schools do.'' Some Thanksgiving games have been ""tanked"" in recent years. In 2016, Duxbury was 11-0, ranked No. 1 in EMass going into its Thanksgiving game against Marshfield. Duxbury coaches elected to rest their starters for the following weekend's Super Bowl and lost on Thanksgiving to Marshfield, 53-0. The Dragons then won nine days later, beating Shrewsbury at Gillette Stadium, 40-7. In 2014, Holliston rested its starters against Westwood on Thanksgiving, lost 33-0, then won its Super Bowl, 43-0, the following week against Wahconah Regional at Gillette Stadium. Related: What's your school's Thanksgiving Day record? In 2013, the first year of this format, Redding watched Mansfield's best player, Brendan Hill, tear his ACL in a ""meaningless"" Thanksgiving rivalry game vs. Foxborough. Mansfield went on to win its Super Bowl anyway. ""In 2013, we asked our players, 'Do you want to play in this [Thanksgiving] game?' And every player said, 'We want to play. We don't want to lose our undefeated season.' But then Brendan tore his ACL and our best running back separated his shoulder. We don't have a game [the week before Thanksgiving] this year, so we are going to play Thanksgiving as a normal game.'' Jim O'Leary, chair of the MIAA's football committee, and a former AD and football coach at St. John's Prep says, ""I have a problem with coaches that don't coach or try to win the game and play their freshmen and lose, 42-0, but I understand why some people would do it. ""People very clearly don't want to get rid of Thanksgiving. We have to work around that and that's what we did. This isn't Texas or Western Pennsylvania. I think we have good perspective on football here. I would hate to see Thanksgiving go by the boards."" ""The games mean nothing now,'' says Mike Lynch, longtime Channel 5 sports anchor who has dedicated much programming to high school sports. Lynch played at Swampscott High and his late father was a longtime staff member under legendary Stan Bondelevich at Swampscott before serving as athletic director at Danvers High. ""Covering Thanksgiving games for Channel 5, we've been burned by going to games where teams played their JV players because they are going to be in the Super Bowl the following week,'' says Lynch. ""I can't imagine not playing in my Thanksgiving game. It's unthinkable. They'd have had to have chained me to the door to keep me from playing.'' Related: When are the 2019 high school Super Bowls? ""The crowds are a lot smaller,'' says Catholic Memorial coach John DiBiaso, who had a long career at Everett High with multiple state championships. ""At Everett, we used to play our Thanksgiving game at Harvard Stadium. It didn't matter what the records were. It was the last time the kids played together. Now it's a little different and it's a sin because this is unique to Massachusetts. This was a nice little thing we had.'' DiBiaso's CM squad has a chance to win a state championship on Dec. 7. Meanwhile, the Knights will play BC High Thursday, continuing a series that started in 1962. The Thanksgiving rivals already played Nov. 8 in a ""tournament"" game, with CM winning, 27-16. John Bartlett, who coached BC High for eight years and has been AD for 20 years, said, ""There's definitely been a drop in attendance for Thanksgiving. When you play them in the playoffs, then play them again two weeks later, there's not as much at stake. There are not as many fans attending. ""It's definitely a conundrum for the state. I understand and I like that there are more teams in the playoffs, but there's not as much at stake now. I can see how each side looks at this differently.'' BC High-CM will be one of nine 2019 Thanksgiving games that will be ""rematches.'' ""I was talking to one of my high school teammates the other day, and I asked him if he was going to the BC High-CM Thanksgiving game,"" said former Boston University hockey coach Jack Parker (CM '63). ""He thought I was incorrect about CM's opponent because CM already played BC High. He just moved back to Boston recently and didn't know about the new format. He was surprised at the weirdness of such a format. ""Am I the only one who thinks the system is ridiculous?"" Longtime Newton North athletic director Tom Giusti notes, ""Crowds for our Thanksgiving game have been down. It used to be that our game could be for the league championship, but that's gone now because of the format. We've already played Brookline in our first seven games. We could have played them again in the tournament. This could be our third game with them. And the game doesn't mean as much. The kids lose a little something when this happens. It's harder to motivate them.'' ""Thanksgiving is just not the same,'' argues Lynch. ""And it's a huge financial hit for some of these schools. When my dad was athletic director at Danvers, the gate from the Thanksgiving game would fund the entire winter sports program. Now it means nothing. The crowds have dwindled. The people are not there.'' ""This is not Swampscott in 1970,'' counters O'Leary. ""I think everything has been diluted in every sport in every manner in every tournament by attendance. It's not the same. But that's where we are. I just don't think football has the same status of 15 years ago.'' Dan Shaughnessy is a Globe columnist. He can be reached at dshaughnessy@globe.com.

"Brown, Hubbard lead No. 22 Oklahoma State over WVU 20-13  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) - Here's something else to add to the conversation for Chuba Hubbard's Heisman Trophy chances: The nation's rushing leader is a solid receiver, too. Hubbard set career highs with seven catches for 88 yards Saturday in No. 22 Oklahoma State's 20-13 win over West Virginia. Oh, and the sophomore also surpassed 100 yards rushing for the ninth consecutive game to push his total to 1,832 yards. ""In the second half, we just started riding Chuba,"" said Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy. Hubbard and quarterback Dru Brown, who threw two touchdown passes in his first start, generated just enough offense for the Cowboys (8-3, 5-3 Big 12, No. 21 CFP), who won their fourth straight. Hubbard entered the game with 82 receiving yards all season and Gundy had emphasized earlier in the week he didn't throw to Hubbard that often out of fear of injury. But Gundy said West Virginia took away Hubbard's effectiveness on the ground early. ""It forced us into throwing the ball to him some, more so than him running,"" Gundy said. ""It worked out good for us."" Hubbard ran 46 yards with a screen pass to set up Oklahoma State's first touchdown. ""Chuba, he's the real deal,"" said West Virginia coach Neal Brown. ""I knew coming in he's a great player. I leave the game, he's a great player."" Hubbard said it doesn't matter how he gets the ball. ""I just try my best to get first downs and score,"" he said. ""I was just trying to do my job and make something happen."" Hubbard ran 26 times for 106 yards, far below his 173-yard average, but he ran for 47 yards on two key second-half drives that helped Oklahoma State take control. Dru Brown marched Oklahoma State the length of the field early in the fourth quarter, hitting Dillon Stoner with a 2-yard scoring pass for a 17-13 lead. ""I was really proud of Dru, the way he took care of the ball and didn't turn it over,"" Gundy said. West Virginia (4-7, 2-6) didn't have as much luck inside the red zone. The Mountaineers couldn't convert on three plays from the 1-yard line in the second quarter and they twice had to settle for short field goals. Leddie Brown converted a fourth-and-1 from the Oklahoma State 18 with 2:37 left in the game. But Jarret Doege threw three incompletions, the Mountaineers turned the ball over on downs and Oklahoma State ran out the clock. ""Just too many missed opportunities. That sums it up,"" Neal Brown said. ""Credit them. They made enough plays at the end of the game."" Doege finished 28 of 38 for 307 yards in his second start since taking over for Austin Kendall, including a 34-yard scoring toss in the second quarter to his roommate, George Campbell. Seven of Campbell's 19 receptions this season have gone for touchdowns. THE TAKEAWAY Oklahoma State: The Cowboys were outgained 333-285 but managed to make the most of it. Dru Brown, a graduate transfer from Hawaii, completed 22 of 29 passes for 196 yards in place of the injured Spencer Sanders. West Virginia: The Mountaineers lost for the sixth time in seven games and their bowl hopes are over. A defense that looked impressive against Hubbard in the first half gave him just enough room to break free after halftime and the offense was limited to 128 yards and three points after halftime. FAMILY FIRST Gundy stayed behind in Stillwater, Oklahoma, on Friday night to watch his son, Gunnar, win a state semifinal playoff game. Gunnar Gundy is a senior quarterback at Stillwater High School. ""Those are special times for me,"" Gundy said. ""I've missed a lot of his games. It's just not something I could pass up on."" Mike Gundy flew to West Virginia afterward to join his players and coaches. ""I bet half the guys didn't even know I wasn't there,"" he said. ""And if they can't take care of themselves for about seven or eight hours, we got serious issues."" POLL IMPLICATIONS The Cowboys could move up a spot or two in The Associated Press poll that comes out on Sunday. UP NEXT Oklahoma State plays No. 8 Oklahoma in the Bedlam game next Saturday in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

"Tkachuk's shootout goal helps Flames top Flyers, end skid  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The Calgary Flames used a fortunate bounce to pick up a sorely needed win. Matthew Tkachuk scored the only goal in the shootout, and the Flames beat the Philadelphia Flyers 3-2 on Saturday to stop a six-game slide. ""It feels good, obviously,"" Flames coach Bill Peters said. ""We needed it."" Lindholm tied it at 2 when he scored with 1:23 left in regulation. After David Rittich was pulled in favor of an extra attacker, Rasmus Andersson's slap shot from the point went wide of the net. But it ricocheted off the back boards to a wide-open Lindholm, who knocked in his 11th of the season. ""We got a little bit of a bounce, but we were due for a bounce,"" Peters said. ""It's crazy. Some of the stuff that hasn't gone in was challenging. We were due."" Andrew Mangiapane also scored for the Flames, who were shut out in their previous three road games as part of their skid. ""It just feels really nice to be back in the win column,"" Andersson said. ""It felt like a long time ago. We're all excited in here."" Kevin Hayes and Jakub Voracek scored for Philadelphia, which lost for the fifth time in six games. ""We played extremely well but just came out on the wrong side of a shootout,"" Flyers coach Alain Vigneault said. Rittich made 27 saves and stopped all three Flyers attempts in the tiebreaker. Tkachuk, Calgary's second shooter, scored on a backhander that went through Carter Hart's legs. Philadelphia grabbed a 2-1 lead with 3:46 left in regulation when Hayes capitalized on a stellar hustle play by rookie forward Joel Farabee. Rittich tried to play the puck behind the net, but Farabee forced him into a turnover. Hayes then converted a backhander for his sixth of the season and second in as many games. Mangiapane tied it at 1 1:01 into the third period, stopping the Flames' long scoreless road drought. After a turnover by Flyers rookie Morgan Frost in his third career game, Mangiapane's wrist shot went off defenseman Philippe Myers and past Hart. Calgary's previous road goal had come Nov. 3 at Washington with two seconds left in the first period, a span of 261 minutes, 3 seconds between road scores. ""You have to stay positive,"" said Mangiapane, who played with a full face shield after breaking his nose in Thursday's 5-0 loss at St. Louis. ""As of late, goals haven't been bouncing our way. Eventually they would."" Flames star Johnny Gaudreau, a South Jersey native who attended nearby Gloucester Catholic High School, had the secondary assist on Lindholm's goal. He has four goals and 10 assists in 11 games against the Flyers. NOTES: Flyers D Shayne Gostisbehere was a healthy scratch. ... Flames D TJ Brodie joined the team for the first time since collapsing in practice Nov. 14. Brodie, who skated on Thursday for the first time since the incident, has missed four straight games. There is no timetable for his return. ... Philadelphia F Scott Laughton returned to the lineup after missing 13 games with a broken finger. ... Calgary won the season series 2-0.

"US security adviser says world silent on China camps  Link to Image HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) - President Donald Trump's new national security adviser is criticizing what he says is silence from the rest of the world over China's confinement of more than 1 million Muslims in reeducation camps, linking the lack of a global outcry to China's economic clout. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien also questioned whether international leaders will stand up if Beijing carries out a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown on the pro -democracy protests in Hong Kong. O'Brien met with journalists and was interviewed by a moderator at the Halifax International Security Forum on Saturday. ""Where is the world? We have over a million people in concentration camps,"" O'Brien said. ""I've been to the genocide museum in Rwanda. You hear 'never again, never again is this going to happen,' and yet there are reeducation camps with over a million people in them."" O'Brien said the lack of criticism is especially surprising from Islamic states. China is estimated to have detained up to 1 million minority Muslims Uighurs in prisonlike detention centers. The detentions come on top of harsh travel restrictions and a massive state surveillance network equipped with facial recognition technology. China has denied committing abuses in the centers and has described them as schools aimed at providing employable skills and combating extremism. China and the U.S. are locked in a mutual trade war, and the Trump administration has alternated between blasting the country's leadership and reaching out to it. Trump imposed tariffs last year on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese exports to the U.S., seeking to ramp up pressure for changes in Chinese trade and investment policies. China has retaliated with tariff hikes of its own. O'Brien said an initial trade agreement with China is still possible by the end of the year, but said the U.S. won't take a bad deal and won't ignore what happens in Hong Kong. O'Brien also said U.S. allies should think hard before allowing Chinese technology giant Huawei into their next generation of telecommunication networks, citing surveillance concerns. ""What the Chinese are doing makes Facebook and Google look like child's play as far as collecting information on folks. Once they know the full profile of every man, woman and child in your country, how are they going to use that?"" he asked. Huawei spokespeople did not immediately return an email seeking comment Saturday. Dolkun Isa, President of the World Uyghur Congress, said at Saturday's conference that Trump himself has not addressed the camps publicly. Isa said his mother recently died in one of the camps. O'Brien responded that the administration has spoken out about it. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is among the Trump officials who have raised China's mistreatment of the Muslim Uighur minority, including citing it as a violation of religious freedom in a speech last month. O'Brien declined to say what the U.S. would do if there were a crackdown in Hong Kong that rivals the Tiananmen Square in 1989. More than 100,000 Americans and over 300,000 Canadians live in Hong Kong. ""I don't want to get into tools or what the U.S. might or might not do,"" he said ""But much of the world and many or our allies, and many of the countries represented at this conference, have been willing to forget Tiananmen Square and are heavily engaged in business with China."" O'Brien is the fourth person in two years to hold the job of national security adviser. He previously served as Trump's chief hostage negotiator. O'Brien made headlines in July when he was dispatched to Sweden to monitor the assault trial of American rapper A$AP Rocky. As the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department, O'Brien worked closely with the families of American hostages and advised administration officials on hostage issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Hong Kong unrest turns quiet race into referendum on protests  Link to Image HONG KONG - After months of antigovernment protests in Hong Kong, voters Sunday will have a chance to cast their opinion on the city's future - albeit through an election for a group of local officials who mainly deal with noise complaints, bus stop locations, and neighborhood beautification projects. The district council is one of the lowest rungs of Hong Kong's elected offices. It is usually a quiet affair focused on community issues. FULL TEXT But the race has taken on outsize significance in the midst of the increasingly violent protests that have divided the city. The election will be the first test of whether the protests can transform public anger that has led millions to take to the streets into actual votes, or whether the populace has grown weary of acts of civil disobedience that have snarled transportation and closed schools and businesses. ""Politically speaking, the battle of the district councils as a whole is a crucial battle in taking control,"" said Eddie Chu, a prodemocracy legislator who is also running for district council. It has been an especially intense election season. Several candidates, on both sides, have been attacked. The police fired tear gas at a campaign rally this month and arrested three candidates. Fears have been widespread that the city leadership could postpone the vote over the unrest. Here's a look at the race and what is at stake: Big election for small office A call to expand Hong Kong's limited democracy is one of the demands of the protest movement, which began in June over a now-withdrawn proposal that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Protesters have called for direct elections for the entire legislature, where currently only 40 of the 70 seats are selected by popular vote. They have also called for the chief executive, who is selected by a largely pro-Beijing election committee, to instead be chosen by voters. The district councils have no lawmaking power. They control small amounts of public funds for simple infrastructure, like rain shelters. They lodge concerns with government departments over noise, traffic, sanitation, and other issues. (Of the 479 district council seats, 452 are directly elected.) The district council members do have a modest role in choosing the chief executive, Hong Kong's highest official. Whichever side wins a majority of the seats controls 117 votes in the 1,200-member chief executive election committee. That election committee is dominated by pro-establishment corporate interests, and the chief executives they have selected have always been loyal to Beijing. But a win would give the overall prodemocracy camp control of an additional 10 percent of the votes and put it close to the 150 votes necessary to nominate a candidate. Protesters' demands encroach on local issues The brochures of district council candidates typically show neighborhood concerns they pledge to fix: trash-filled alleys, air-conditioners dripping on sidewalks, and streets lined with illegally parked cars. This year, several prodemocracy candidates have included protest slogans on their materials. Law Cheuk-yung, 22, said he was inspired to run for district council because of recent social movements. He said he would demand answers from the police after residents complained of possible testing of tear gas in his district. ""I want to imagine local government being more responsive,"" he said. ""At the moment the district council is just a rubber stamp. They do whatever the government wants."" For such candidates, it is more about playing to the sentiment of the protests rather than taking action. They would not have much of a role in addressing protesters' demands, which include an investigation into the police's use of force, offering amnesty to those arrested in the protests and expanding direct elections. Traditionally, an establishment stronghold Establishment parties have long had an advantage in these races, in part because they are much better funded, with backing from businesses. Currently the pro-Beijing camp holds 327 district council seats versus 124 for the prodemocracy group. Rising interest in the election has meant that prodemocracy candidates are participating in every race, unlike previous years, when some establishment district council members ran unopposed. And after worries about disqualifications, only one of the camp's candidates, the prominent activist Joshua Wong, was barred from running this year for political reasons. A campaign plagued by violence A string of violent attacks on election candidates has hung over the race. Twelve opposition figures, including prominent politicians and activists as well as first-time candidates, have been ambushed and bloodied by gangs of masked men or attacked while canvassing for votes. ""We can see Hong Kong isn't as free and as civilized as we'd previously imagined,"" said Jannelle Leung, a 25-year-old accountant who was struck in the back of her head with a hard object in early October the day she announced she was officially running.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"New documents show contacts between Giuliani and Pompeo  Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - Newly released documents show Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was in contact with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the months before the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was abruptly recalled. The State Department released the documents Friday to the group American Oversight in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. They show that Pompeo talked with Giuliani on March 26 and March 29. FULL TEXT Austin Evers, executive director of American Oversight, said the documents reveal ""a clear paper trail from Rudy Giuliani to the Oval Office to Secretary Pompeo to facilitate Giuliani's smear campaign against a U.S. ambassador."" Last week, former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch told House impeachment investigators she felt ""kneecapped"" by a ""smear campaign"" Giuliani led against her. She was withdrawn from her post in Ukraine in May. The documents released Friday also include a report, that appears with Trump hotel stationery, that appears to summarize a Jan. 23 interview with a former Ukrainian prosecutor general, Victor Shokin. The summary says Giuliani and two business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were present. Parnas and Fruman were arrested last month on a four-count indictment that includes charges of conspiracy, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and falsification of records. The men had key roles in Giuliani's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter. A second memo appears to be a summary of an interview with Yuri Lutsenko, another former prosecutor general of Ukraine, conducted in the presence of Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman. Lutsenko is quoted raising questions about compensation that Hunter Biden received from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. In a Fox News interview, Giuliani was asked Saturday about the work that Parnas and Fruman did for him in Ukraine. The two men's efforts included helping to arrange a January meeting in New York between Giuliani and Lutsenko, as well as other meetings with top government officials. Lutsenko, who replaced Shokhin in 2016, left the post in August of 2019. ""So, they helped me find people, and as I've said, they did a good job, but they weren't investigators, and they weren't James Bond, and they didn't have personal communications with the president,"" Giuliani said. Giuliani allowed that he did introduce the two men to Trump at a Hanukkah party in December of 2018. But there was no extended meeting or conversations, he said. ""They took a one-minute picture. They walked away,"" he said. Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating the business dealings of Giuliani, including whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, according to people familiar with the probe. Giuliani was asked whether he was concerned about being indicted. ""Do you think I'm afraid. Do you think I get afraid? I did the right thing. I represented my client in a very, very effective way. I was so effective that I discovered a pattern of corruption that the Washington press has been covering up for three or four years,"" Giuliani asserted. Giuliani said he continues to have a good relationship with the president and that it can be assumed he talks to Trump ""early and often."" Giuliani said he's seen things written that Trump is intending to throw him under the bus. ""When they say that, I say he isn't, but I have insurance,"" Giuliani said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No. 1 LSU sees hope for maligned defense in SEC title game  Link to Image Link to Image BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - LSU safety Jacoby Stevens and his defensive teammates sound determined to disprove the notion that they represent the top-ranked Tigers' greatest liability as college football's postseason arrives. Their most recent showing in a 50-7 victory over Texas A&M last weekend provided evidence that LSU's defense could bolster, rather than undermine, the unbeaten Tigers' chances against No. 4 Georgia in Saturday's Southeastern Conference championship. ""You hear all along the offense is great but the defense is not,"" Stevens said. ""As a competitor, you take that as motivation. You want to change that narrative, and I feel like we did that."" One game is a small sample size, but that sample was a promising display of dominance against an Aggies team that entered Tiger Stadium averaging 419.6 yards and 32.1 points per game. The Tigers allowed just 169 yards in a performance highlighted by six sacks - one for a safety - and three interceptions. LSU defensive lineman Rashard Lawrence was among several Tigers who mentioned being motivated partly by the College Football Playoff committee's decision last week to drop LSU in its ranking from No. 1 to No. 2 - behind Ohio State. Committee members mentioned that they viewed the Buckeyes as a more complete team that has performed well on offense and defense. ""We had a lot to prove,"" Lawrence said. ""We weren't really competing against Texas A&M. We were competing with ourselves and just having a four-quarter, physical, tough mindset."" Even LSU quarterback Joe Burrow said he noticed the sense of purpose pervading the Tigers' defense. ""The defense wanted to send a message to the country,"" Burrow said. ""They've been criticized for the last half of the season and that is what they were talking about all week."" Georgia's offensive numbers are similar to those of A&M's: 420.6 yards and 32.9 points per game, but the Bulldogs have seen their offense sputter at times in recent weeks. Georgia quarterback Jake Fromm has gone four straight games completing less than half of his passing attempts. Top receiver Lawrence Cager is out following ankle surgery, and Georgia's top healthy receiver, George Pickens, is suspended for first half of Saturday's game because of his ejection for fighting during the Bulldogs' victory last weekend over Georgia Tech. Also unclear is Georgia running back D'Ándre Swift's form after injuring his shoulder last week. But the Tigers don't want to become preoccupied with what is ailing the Bulldogs. LSU wants to avoid the lapses that has them ranked 35th nationally in total defense, giving up 345.9 yards per game, and 31st in scoring defense, allowing 22.1 points per game. ""The defense hasn't been playing right throughout the season,"" LSU edge pass rusher K'Lavon Chaisson said. ""We're thankful the offense is helping us out a lot. We were so grateful, but we know as a defense the offense can't save us every game and we need to pick it up."" Four times this season, LSU gave up at least 450 yards and 37 points. The first three instances occurred during victories at Texas, Vanderbilt and Alabama. The fourth occurred three games ago at Mississippi, when LSU allowed 614 yards. Stevens was among the LSU defensive veterans who lambasted his own unit after the Ole Miss game. He's since backed up his pledge to improve with three sacks against Arkansas and his interception against A&M. Chaisson had a sack-and-a-half against A&M and harassed Aggies QB Kellen Mond much of the night. ""There's too many high-caliber players on this defense to be disrespected,"" Chaisson said. The secondary is led by preseason All-America safety Grant Delpit and Stevens, along with cornerbacks Kristian Fulton and Derek Stingley Jr. The linebacker corps features Patrick Queen, known for his sideline-to-sidelined range, and Jacob Phillips, a stout tackler and strong communicator who relays defensive coaches' pre-snap instructions. Georgia coach Kirby Smart cited LSU's linebackers when explaining why he thought the Tigers were improving defensively. ""They played better and better, really aggressive,"" Smart said. ""They've created pass rush with their linebackers - and they're cover guys."" Chaisson, with 10 ½ tackles for loss, has led LSU up front. Lawrence, who missed three games with injuries this season, had a sack last week and appeared to be rounding back into form. Stevens said the most encouraging aspect of LSU's performance against A&M was the Tigers' ability to create pressure up front without resorting often to exotic stunts or blitzes. ""When you can do that, that's when you hit another level defensive-wise,"" Stevens said. ___ AP Sports Writer Charles Odum in Athens, Georgia, contributed to this report. ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and            https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Read the House Intelligence Committee's full impeachment report  Link to Image The following is the full impeachment report that the House Intelligence Committee released on Tuesday afternoon:  The impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election. As described in this executive summary and the report that follows, President Trump's scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign. The President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. To compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditioned two official acts on the public announcement of the investigations: a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary. FULL TEXT During a July 25, 2019, call between President Trump and President Zelensky, President Zelensky expressed gratitude for U.S. military assistance. President Trump immediately responded by asking President Zelensky to ""do us a favor though"" and openly pressed for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden and the 2016 conspiracy theory. In turn, President Zelensky assured President Trump that he would pursue the investigation and reiterated his interest in the White House meeting. Although President Trump's scheme intentionally bypassed many career personnel, it was undertaken with the knowledge and approval of senior Administration officials, including the President's Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. In fact, at a press conference weeks after public revelations about the scheme, Mr. Mulvaney publicly acknowledged that the President directly tied the hold on military aid to his desire to get Ukraine to conduct a political investigation, telling Americans to ""get over it."" President Trump and his senior officials may see nothing wrong with using the power of the Office of the President to pressure a foreign country to help the President's reelection campaign. Indeed, President Trump continues to encourage Ukraine and other foreign countries to engage in the same kind of election interference today. However, the Founding Fathers prescribed a remedy for a chief executive who places his personal interests above those of the country: impeachment. Accordingly, as part of the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in coordination with the Committees on Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs, were compelled to undertake a serious, sober, and expeditious investigation into whether the President's misconduct warrants that remedy. In response, President Trump engaged in an unprecedented campaign of obstruction of this impeachment inquiry. Nevertheless, due in large measure to patriotic and courageous public servants who provided the Committees with direct evidence of the President's actions, the Committees uncovered significant misconduct on the part of the President of the United States. As required under House Resolution 660, the Intelligence Committee, in consultation with the Committees on Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs, has prepared this report to detail the evidence uncovered to date, which will now be transmitted to the Judiciary Committee for its consideration. PREFACE  This report reflects the evidence gathered thus far by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in coordination with the Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, as part of the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States. The report is the culmination of an investigation that began in September 2019 and intensified over the past three months as new revelations and evidence of the President's misconduct towards Ukraine emerged. The Committees pursued the truth vigorously, but fairly, ensuring the full participation of both parties throughout the probe. Sustained by the tireless work of more than three dozen dedicated staff across the three Committees, we issued dozens of subpoenas for documents and testimony and took more than 100 hours of deposition testimony from 17 witnesses. To provide the American people the opportunity to learn and evaluate the facts themselves, the Intelligence Committee held seven public hearings with 12 witnesses-including three requested by the Republican Minority-that totaled more than 30 hours. At the outset, I want to recognize my late friend and colleague Elijah E. Cummings, whose grace and commitment to justice served as our North Star throughout this investigation. I would also like to thank my colleagues Eliot L. Engel and Carolyn B. Maloney, chairs respectively of the Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform Committees, as well as the Members of those Committees, many of whom provided invaluable contributions. Members of the Intelligence Committee, as well, worked selflessly and collaboratively throughout this investigation. Finally, I am grateful to Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the trust she placed in our Committees to conduct this work and for her wise counsel throughout. I also want to thank the dedicated professional staff of the Intelligence Committee, who worked ceaselessly and with remarkable poise and ability. My deepest gratitude goes to Daniel Goldman, Rheanne Wirkkala, Maher Bitar, Timothy Bergreen, Patrick Boland, Daniel Noble, Nicolas Mitchell, Sean Misko, Patrick Fallon, Diana Pilipenko, William Evans, Ariana Rowberry, Wells Bennett, and William Wu. Additional Intelligence Committee staff members also assured that the important oversight work of the Committee continued, even as we were required to take on the additional responsibility of conducting a key part of the House impeachment inquiry. Finally, I would like to thank the devoted and outstanding staff of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, including but not limited to Dave Rapallo, Susanne Sachsman Grooms, Peter Kenny, Krista Boyd, and Janet Kim, as well as Laura Carey from the Committee on Foreign Affairs. * * * In his farewell address, President George Washington warned of a moment when ""cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion."" The Framers of the Constitution well understood that an individual could one day occupy the Office of the President who would place his personal or political interests above those of the nation. Having just won hard-fought independence from a King with unbridled authority, they were attuned to the dangers of an executive who lacked fealty to the law and the Constitution. In response, the Framers adopted a tool used by the British Parliament for several hundred years to constrain the Crown-the power of impeachment. Unlike in Britain, where impeachment was typically reserved for inferior officers but not the King himself, impeachment in our untested democracy was specifically intended to serve as the ultimate form of accountability for a duly-elected President. Rather than a mechanism to overturn an election, impeachment was explicitly contemplated as a remedy of last resort for a president who fails to faithfully execute his oath of office ""to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" Accordingly, the Constitution confers the power to impeach the president on Congress, stating that the president shall be removed from office upon conviction for ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" While the Constitutional standard for removal from office is justly a high one, it is nonetheless an essential check and balance on the authority of the occupant of the Office of the President, particularly when that occupant represents a continuing threat to our fundamental democratic norms, values, and laws. Alexander Hamilton explained that impeachment was not designed to cover only criminal violations, but also crimes against the American people. ""The subjects of its jurisdiction,"" Hamilton wrote, ""are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself."" Similarly, future Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court James Wilson, a delegate from Pennsylvania at the Constitutional Convention, distinguished impeachable offenses from those that reside ""within the sphere of ordinary jurisprudence."" As he noted, ""impeachments are confined to political characters, to political crimes and misdemeanors, and to political punishments."" * * * As this report details, the impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection. In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump's domestic political opponent. In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine. The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security. At the center of this investigation is the memorandum prepared following President Trump's July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine's President, which the White House declassified and released under significant public pressure. The call record alone is stark evidence of misconduct; a demonstration of the President's prioritization of his personal political benefit over the national interest. In response to President Zelensky's appreciation for vital U.S. military assistance, which President Trump froze without explanation, President Trump asked for ""a favor though"": two specific investigations designed to assist his reelection efforts. Our investigation determined that this telephone call was neither the start nor the end of President Trump's efforts to bend U.S. foreign policy for his personal gain. Rather, it was a dramatic crescendo within a months-long campaign driven by President Trump in which senior U.S. officials, including the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Acting Chief of Staff, the Secretary of Energy, and others were either knowledgeable of or active participants in an effort to extract from a foreign nation the personal political benefits sought by the President. The investigation revealed the nature and extent of the President's misconduct, notwithstanding an unprecedented campaign of obstruction by the President and his Administration to prevent the Committees from obtaining documentary evidence and testimony. A dozen witnesses followed President Trump's orders, defying voluntary requests and lawful subpoenas, and refusing to testify. The White House, Department of State, Department of Defense, Office of Management and Budget, and Department of Energy refused to produce a single document in response to our subpoenas. Ultimately, this sweeping effort to stonewall the House of Representatives' ""sole Power of Impeachment"" under the Constitution failed because witnesses courageously came forward and testified in response to lawful process. The report that follows was only possible because of their sense of duty and devotion to their country and its Constitution. Nevertheless, there remain unanswered questions, and our investigation must continue, even as we transmit our report to the Judiciary Committee. Given the proximate threat of further presidential attempts to solicit foreign interference in our next election, we cannot wait to make a referral until our efforts to obtain additional testimony and documents wind their way through the courts. The evidence of the President's misconduct is overwhelming, and so too is the evidence of his obstruction of Congress. Indeed, it would be hard to imagine a stronger or more complete case of obstruction than that demonstrated by the President since the inquiry began. The damage the President has done to our relationship with a key strategic partner will be remedied over time, and Ukraine continues to enjoy strong bipartisan support in Congress. But the damage to our system of checks and balances, and to the balance of power within our three branches of government, will be long-lasting and potentially irrevocable if the President's ability to stonewall Congress goes unchecked. Any future President will feel empowered to resist an investigation into their own wrongdoing, malfeasance, or corruption, and the result will be a nation at far greater risk of all three. * * * The decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry is not one we took lightly. Under the best of circumstances, impeachment is a wrenching process for the nation. I resisted calls to undertake an impeachment investigation for many months on that basis, notwithstanding the existence of presidential misconduct that I believed to be deeply unethical and damaging to our democracy. The alarming events and actions detailed in this report, however, left us with no choice but to proceed. In making the decision to move forward, we were struck by the fact that the President's misconduct was not an isolated occurrence, nor was it the product of a naïve president. Instead, the efforts to involve Ukraine in our 2020 presidential election were undertaken by a President who himself was elected in 2016 with the benefit of an unprecedented and sweeping campaign of election interference undertaken by Russia in his favor, and which the President welcomed and utilized. Having witnessed the degree to which interference by a foreign power in 2016 harmed our democracy, President Trump cannot credibly claim ignorance to its pernicious effects. Even more pointedly, the President's July call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, in which he solicited an investigation to damage his most feared 2020 opponent, came the day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress about Russia's efforts to damage his 2016 opponent and his urgent warning of the dangers of further foreign interference in the next election. With this backdrop, the solicitation of new foreign intervention was the act of a president unbound, not one chastened by experience. It was the act of a president who viewed himself as unaccountable and determined to use his vast official powers to secure his reelection. This repeated and pervasive threat to our democratic electoral process added urgency to our work. On October 3, 2019, even as our Committee was engaged in this inquiry, President Trump publicly declared anew that other countries should open investigations into his chief political rival, saying, ""China should start an investigation into the Bidens,"" and that ""President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens."" When a reporter asked the President what he hoped Ukraine's President would do following the July 25 call, President Trump, seeking to dispel any doubt as to his continuing intention, responded: ""Well, I would think that, if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer."" By doubling down on his misconduct and declaring that his July 25 call with President Zelensky was ""perfect,"" President Trump has shown a continued willingness to use the power of his office to seek foreign intervention in our next election. His Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, in the course of admitting that the President had linked security assistance to Ukraine to the announcement of one of his desired investigations, told the American people to ""get over it."" In these statements and actions, the President became the author of his own impeachment inquiry. The question presented by the set of facts enumerated in this report may be as simple as that posed by the President and his chief of staff's brazenness: is the remedy of impeachment warranted for a president who would use the power of his office to coerce foreign interference in a U.S. election, or is that now a mere perk of the office that Americans must simply ""get over""? * * * Those watching the impeachment hearings might have been struck by how little discrepancy there was between the witnesses called by the Majority and Minority. Indeed, most of the facts presented in the pages that follow are uncontested. The broad outlines as well as many of the details of the President's scheme have been presented by the witnesses with remarkable consistency. There will always be some variation in the testimony of multiple people witnessing the same events, but few of the differences here go to the heart of the matter. And so, it may have been all the more surprising to the public to see very disparate reactions to the testimony by the Members of Congress from each party. If there was one ill the Founding Founders feared as much as that of an unfit president, it may have been that of excessive factionalism. Although the Framers viewed parties as necessary, they also endeavored to structure the new government in such a way as to minimize the ""violence of faction."" As George Washington warned in his farewell address, ""the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it."" Today, we may be witnessing a collision between the power of a remedy meant to curb presidential misconduct and the power of faction determined to defend against the use of that remedy on a president of the same party. But perhaps even more corrosive to our democratic system of governance, the President and his allies are making a comprehensive attack on the very idea of fact and truth. How can a democracy survive without acceptance of a common set of experiences? America remains the beacon of democracy and opportunity for freedom-loving people around the world. From their homes and their jail cells, from their public squares and their refugee camps, from their waking hours until their last breath, individuals fighting human rights abuses, journalists uncovering and exposing corruption, persecuted minorities struggling to survive and preserve their faith, and countless others around the globe just hoping for a better life look to America. What we do will determine what they see, and whether America remains a nation committed to the rule of law. As Benjamin Franklin departed the Constitutional Convention, he was asked, ""what have we got? A Republic or a Monarchy?"" He responded simply: ""A Republic, if you can keep it."" Adam B. Schiff Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  I. The President's Misconduct: The President Conditioned a White House Meeting and Military Aid to Ukraine on a Public Announcement of Investigations Beneficial to his Reelection Campaign The President's Request for a Political Favor On the morning of July 25, 2019, President Donald Trump settled in to the White House Executive Residence to join a telephone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. It had been more than three months since President Zelensky, a political neophyte, had been swept into office in a landslide victory on a platform of rooting out corruption and ending the war between his country and Russia. The day of his election, April 21, President Zelensky spoke briefly with President Trump, who had called to congratulate him and invite him to a visit at the White House. As of July 25, no White House meeting had materialized. As is typical for telephone calls with other heads of state, staff members from the National Security Council (NSC) convened in the White House Situation Room to listen to the call and take notes, which would later be compiled into a memorandum that would constitute the U.S. government's official record of the call. NSC staff had prepared a standard package of talking points for the President based on official U.S. policy. The talking points included recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine, a pillar of American foreign policy in the country as far back as its independence in the 1990s when Ukraine first rid itself of Kremlin control. This call would deviate significantly from that script. Shortly before he was patched through to President Zelensky, President Trump spoke with Gordon Sondland, who had donated $1 million to President Trump's 2016 presidential inauguration and whom the President had appointed as the United States Ambassador to the European Union. Ambassador Sondland had helped lay the groundwork for a very different kind of call between the two Presidents. Ambassador Sondland had relayed a message to President Zelensky six days earlier that ""assurances to run a fully transparent investigation"" and ""turn over every stone"" were necessary in his call with President Trump. Ambassador Sondland understood these phrases to refer to two investigations politically beneficial to the President's reelection campaign: one into former Vice President Joe Biden and a Ukrainian gas company called Burisma, on which his son sat on the board, and the other into a discredited conspiracy theory alleging that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. The allegations about Vice President Biden were without evidence, and the U.S. Intelligence Community had unanimously determined that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 election to help the candidacy of Donald Trump. Despite the falsehoods, Ambassador Sondland would make it clear to Ukrainian officials that the public announcement of these investigations was a prerequisite for the coveted White House meeting with President Trump, an effort that would help the President's reelection campaign. The White House meeting was not the only official act that President Trump conditioned on the announcement of these investigations. Several weeks before his phone call with President Zelensky, President Trump ordered a hold on nearly $400 million of congressionally-appropriated security assistance to Ukraine that provided Kyiv essential support as it sought to repel Russian forces that were occupying Crimea and inflicting casualties in the eastern region of the country. The President's decision to freeze the aid, made without explanation, sent shock waves through the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of State, and the NSC, which uniformly supported providing this assistance to our strategic partner. Although the suspension of aid had not been made public by the day of the call between the two Presidents, officials at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington had already asked American officials about the status of the vital military assistance. At the outset of the conversation on July 25, President Zelensky thanked President Trump for the ""great support in the area of defense"" provided by the United States to date. He then indicated that Ukraine would soon be prepared to purchase additional Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States as part of this defense cooperation. President Trump immediately responded with his own request: ""I would like you to do us a favor though,"" which was ""to find out what happened"" with alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. President Trump then asked President Zelensky ""to look into"" former Vice President Biden's role in encouraging Ukraine to remove a prosecutor widely viewed by the United States and numerous European partners to be corrupt. In so doing, President Trump gave currency to a baseless allegation that Vice President Biden wanted to remove the corrupt prosecutor because he was investigating Burisma, a company on whose board the Vice President's son sat at the time. Over the course of the roughly thirty-minute call, President Trump repeated these false allegations and pressed the Ukrainian President to consult with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who had been publicly advocating for months for Ukraine to initiate these specific investigations. President Zelensky promised that he would ""work on the investigation of the case."" Later in the call, he thanked President Trump for his invitation to join him at the White House, following up immediately with a comment that, ""[o]n the other hand,"" he would ""ensure"" that Ukraine pursued ""the investigation"" that President Trump had requested. During the call, President Trump also disparaged Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who championed anti-corruption reforms in the country, and whom President Trump had unceremoniously removed months earlier following a smear campaign waged against her by Mr. Giuliani and others. President Trump claimed that she was ""bad news"" and was ""going to go through some things."" He praised the current prosecutor at the time, who was widely viewed as corrupt and who helped initiate the smear campaign against her, calling him ""very good"" and ""very fair."" Hearing the call as it transpired, several White House staff members became alarmed. Far from giving the ""full-throated endorsement of the Ukraine reform agenda"" that had been hoped for, the President instead demanded a political investigation into an American-the presidential candidate he evidently feared most, Joe Biden. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, an NSC staff member responsible for Ukraine policy who listened to the call, immediately reported his concerns to NSC lawyers. His supervisor, NSC Senior Director for Europe and Russia Timothy Morrison, also reported the call to the lawyers, worrying that the call would be ""damaging"" if leaked publicly. In response, the lawyers placed the memorandum summarizing the call onto a highly classified server, significantly limiting access to the materials. The call record would not remain hidden forever. On September 25, 2019, facing immense public pressure to reveal the contents of the call and following the announcement the previous day of a formal impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives into President Trump's actions toward Ukraine, the White House publicly released the memorandum of the July 25 call. The record of the call would help explain for those involved in Ukraine policy in the U.S. government, the Congress, and the public why President Trump, his personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani, his hand-picked appointees in charge of Ukraine issues, and various senior Administration officials would go to great lengths to withhold a coveted White House meeting and critical military aid from Ukraine at a time when it served as a bulwark against Russian aggression in Europe. The answer was as simple as it was inimical to our national security and election integrity: the President was withholding officials acts while soliciting something of value to his reelection campaign-an investigation into his political rival. The story of that scheme follows. The President Removed Anti-Corruption Champion Ambassador Yovanovitch On April 24, 2019, President Donald Trump abruptly called back to Washington the United States Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie ""Masha"" Yovanovitch, after a ruthless smear campaign was waged against her. She was known throughout Ukraine and among her peers for aggressively advocating for anti-corruption reforms consistent with U.S. foreign policy and only recently had been asked to extend her stay in Ukraine. Her effectiveness in anti-corruption efforts earned her enemies in Kyiv and in Washington. As Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified in praising Ambassador Yovanovitch: ""You can't promote principled anticorruption action without pissing off corrupt people."" Beginning on March 20, The Hill newspaper published several op-eds attacking Ambassador Yovanovitch and former Vice President Joe Biden, relying on information from a Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who was widely viewed to be corrupt. Mr. Lutsenko had served as the chief prosecutor in Ukraine under the then-incumbent president who lost to Volodymyr Zelensky in April 2019. Although he would later recant many of his allegations, Mr. Lutsenko falsely accused Ambassador Yovanovitch of speaking negatively about President Trump and giving Mr. Lutsenko a ""do-not-prosecute list."" The attacks against Ambassador Yovanovitch were amplified by prominent, close allies of President Trump, including Mr. Giuliani and his associates, Sean Hannity, and Donald Trump Jr. President Trump tweeted the smears himself just a month before he recalled the Ambassador from Ukraine. In the face of attacks driven by Mr. Lutsenko and the President's allies, Ambassador Yovanovitch and other senior State Department officials asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to issue a statement of support for her and for the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. The Secretary declined, fearing that President Trump might publicly undermine those efforts, possibly through a tweet. Following a ceremony in which she presented an award of courage to the family of a young female anti-corruption activist killed in Ukraine for her work, Ambassador Yovanovitch received an urgent call from the State Department regarding her ""security,"" and imploring her to take the first plane back to Washington. When she arrived, she was informed that she had done nothing wrong, but that the President had lost confidence in her. She was told to leave her post as soon as possible. In her place, the President would designate three new agents to spearhead Ukraine policy, political appointees far more willing to engage in an improper ""domestic political errand"" than an ambassador known for her efforts to fight corruption. The President's Hand-picked Agents Begin the Scheme Just three days before Ambassador Yovanovitch's abrupt recall to Washington, President Trump had his first telephone call with President-elect Zelensky. During that conversation, President Trump congratulated the Ukrainian leader on his victory, complimented him on his country's Miss Universe Pageant contestants, and invited him to visit the White House. A White House meeting would help demonstrate the United States' strong support for Ukraine as it fought a hot war with Russia and attempted to negotiate an end to the conflict with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as to bolster President-elect Zelensky's standing with his own people as he sought to deliver on his promised anti-corruption agenda. Although the White House's public summary of the call included some discussion of a commitment to ""root out corruption,"" President Trump did not mention corruption at all. Shortly after the conversation, President Trump asked Vice President Mike Pence to attend President Zelensky's inauguration. Vice President Pence confirmed directly to President Zelensky his intention to attend during a phone conversation on April 23, and Vice President Pence's staff and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv began preparations for the trip. At the same time, President Trump's personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani, intensified his campaign to pressure Ukraine's newly-elected President to initiate investigations into Joe Biden, who had officially entered the race for the Democratic nomination on April 25, and the baseless conspiracy theory about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. On May 9, the New York Times published an article in which Mr. Giuliani declared that he",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 President Trump, in order to meddle in an investigation. After public backlash, Mr. Giuliani canceled the trip," blaming """"some bad people"""" around President Zelensky. Days later", President Trump rescinded the plans for Vice President Pence to attend President Zelensky's inauguration, which had not yet been scheduled. The staff member planning the trip was not provided an explanation for the about-face," but staff in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv were disappointed that President Zelensky would not receive a """"high level"""" show of support from the United States. In Vice President Pence's stead", Secretary of Energy Rick Perry led the American delegation to the Ukrainian President's inauguration. Ambassador Sondland, Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Ambassador Kurt Volker, and Lt. Col. Vindman also attended. In comments that would foreshadow troubling events to come, Lt. Col. Vindman warned President Zelensky to stay out of U.S. domestic politics to avoid jeopardizing the bipartisan support Ukraine enjoyed in Congress. The delegation returned to the United States impressed with President Zelensky, especially his focus on anti-corruption reforms. Ambassador Sondland quickly organized a meeting with President Trump in the Oval Office on May 23, attended by most of the other members of the delegation. The three political appointees," who would describe themselves as the """"Three Amigos", relayed their positive impression of President Zelensky to President Trump and encouraged him to schedule the Oval Office meeting he promised in his April 21 phone call with the new leader. President Trump reacted poorly to the suggestion," claiming that Ukraine """"tried to take me down"""" in 2016. In order to schedule a White House visit for President Zelensky"," President Trump told the delegation that they would have to """"talk to Rudy."""" Ambassador Sondland testified that he understood the President's instruction to be a directive to work with Mr. Giuliani if they hoped to advance relations with Ukraine. President Trump directed the three senior U.S. government officials to assist Mr. Giuliani's efforts", which, it would soon become clear, were exclusively for the benefit of the President's reelection campaign. As the Three Amigos were given responsibility over the U.S. government's Ukraine portfolio, Bill Taylor, a former Ambassador to Ukraine, was considering whether to come out of retirement to accept a request to succeed Ambassador Yovanovitch in Kyiv. As of May 26," Ambassador Taylor was """"still struggling with the decision", and, in particular," whether anyone can """"hope to succeed with the Giuliani-Biden issue swirling."""" After receiving assurances from Secretary Pompeo that U.S. policy toward Ukraine would not change"," Ambassador Taylor accepted the position and arrived in Kyiv on June 17. Ambassador Taylor would quickly come to observe an """"irregular channel"""" led by Mr. Giuliani that", over time, began to undermine the official channel of diplomatic relations with Ukraine. Mr. Giuliani would prove to be, as the President's National Security Advisor Ambassador John Bolton would tell a colleague," a """"hand grenade that was going to blow everyone up."""" President Trump Froze Vital Military Assistance For fiscal year 2019", Congress appropriated and authorized $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine: $250 million in funds administered by DOD and $141 million in funds administered by the State Department. On June 18, DOD issued a press release announcing its intention to provide $250 million in taxpayer-funded security assistance to Ukraine following the certification that all legitimate conditions on the aid, including anti-corruption reforms, had been met. Shortly after this announcement, however, both the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and DOD received inquiries from the President related to the funds. At that time, and throughout the next few months, support for Ukraine security assistance was overwhelming and unanimous among all of the relevant agencies and within Congress. By July 3, OMB blocked a Congressional notification which would have cleared the way for the release of $141 million in State Department security assistance funds. By July 12, President Trump had placed a hold on all military support funding for Ukraine. On July 18, OMB announced the hold to all of the relevant agencies and indicated that it was directed by the President. No other reason was provided. During a series of policy meetings involving increasingly senior officials, the uniform and consistent position of all policymaking agencies supported the release of funding. Ukraine experts at DOD, the State Department, and the NSC argued that it was in the national security interest of the United States to continue to support Ukraine. As Mr. Morrison testified," """"The United States aids Ukraine and her people so that they can fight Russia over there"," and we don't have to fight Russia here."""" Agency officials also expressed concerns about the legality of President Trump's direction to withhold assistance to Ukraine that Congress had already appropriated for this express purpose. Two OMB career officials", including one of its legal counsels, would resign, in part, over concerns regarding the hold. By July 25, the date of President Trump's call with President Zelensky, DOD was also receiving inquiries from Ukrainian officials about the status of the security assistance. Nevertheless, President Trump continued to withhold the funding to Ukraine without explanation, against the interests of U.S. national security, and over the objections of these career experts. The President Conditioned a White House Meeting on Investigations By the time Ukrainian officials were first learning about an issue with the anticipated military assistance, the President's hand-picked representatives to Ukraine had already informed their Ukrainian counterparts that President Zelensky's coveted White House meeting would only happen after Ukraine committed to pursuing the two political investigations that President Trump and Mr. Giuliani demanded. Ambassador Sondland was unequivocal in describing this conditionality, testifying," """"I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting"," the answer is yes."""" Ambassadors Sondland and Volker worked to obtain the necessary assurance from President Zelensky that he would personally commit to initiate the investigations in order to secure both. On July 2", in Toronto, Canada, Ambassador Volker conveyed the message directly to President Zelensky," specifically referencing the """"Giuliani factor"""" in President Zelensky's engagement with the United States. For his part", Mr. Giuliani made clear to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, who were directly communicating with the Ukrainians, that a White House meeting would not occur until Ukraine announced its pursuit of the two political investigations. After observing Mr. Giuliani's role in the ouster of a U.S. Ambassador and learning of his influence with the President," Ukrainian officials soon understood that """"the key for many things is Rudi [sic]."""" On July 10", Ambassador Bolton hosted a meeting in the White House with two senior Ukrainian officials, several American officials, including Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, Secretary Perry, Dr. Fiona Hill, Senior Director for Europe and Russia at the NSC, and Lt. Col. Vindman. As had become customary each time Ukrainian officials met with their American counterparts, the Ukrainians asked about the long-delayed White House meeting. Ambassador Bolton demurred, but Ambassador Sondland spoke up," revealing that he had worked out an arrangement with Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to schedule the White House visit after Ukraine initiated the """"investigations."""" Ambassador Bolton """"stiffened"""" and quickly ended the meeting. Undaunted", Ambassador Sondland ushered many of the attendees to the Ward Room downstairs to continue their discussion. In the second meeting, Ambassador Sondland explained that he had an agreement with Mr. Mulvaney that the White House visit would come only after Ukraine announced the Burisma/Biden and 2016 Ukraine election interference investigations. At this second meeting," both Lt. Col. Vindman and Dr. Hill objected to intertwining a """"domestic political errand"""" with official foreign policy", and they indicated that a White House meeting would have to go through proper channels. Following these discussions, Dr. Hill reported back to Ambassador Bolton," who told her to """"go and tell [the NSC Legal Advisor] that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this."""" Both Dr. Hill and Lt. Col. Vindman separately reported the incident to the NSC Legal Advisor. The President's Agents Pursued a """"Drug Deal"""" Over the next two weeks"," Ambassadors Sondland and Volker worked closely with Mr. Giuliani and senior Ukrainian and American officials to arrange a telephone call between President Trump and President Zelensky and to ensure that the Ukrainian President explicitly promised to undertake the political investigations required by President Trump to schedule the White House meeting. As Ambassador Sondland would later testify: """"Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States"," and we knew these investigations were important to the President."""" On July 19", Ambassador Volker had breakfast with Mr. Giuliani and his associate, Lev Parnas, at the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C. Mr. Parnas would subsequently be indicted for campaign finance violations as part of an investigation that remains ongoing. During the conversation," Ambassador Volker stressed his belief that the attacks being leveled publicly against Vice President Biden related to Ukraine were false and that the former Vice President was """"a person of integrity."""" He counseled Mr. Giuliani that the Ukrainian prosecutor pushing the false narrative", Mr. Lutsenko," was promoting """"a self-serving narrative to preserve himself in power."""" Mr. Giuliani agreed", but his promotion of Mr. Lutsenko's false accusations for the benefit of President Trump did not cease. Ambassador Volker also offered to help arrange an in-person meeting between Mr. Giuliani and Andriy Yermak, one of President Zelensky's most trusted advisors, which would later take place in Madrid, Spain in early August. After the breakfast meeting at the Trump Hotel, Ambassador Volker reported back to Ambassadors Sondland and Taylor about his conversation with Mr. Giuliani, writing in a text message that," """"Most impt [sic] is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation-and address any specific personnel issues-if there are any", likely referencing President Zelensky's decision to remove Mr. Lutsenko as prosecutor general, a decision with which Mr. Giuliani disagreed. The same day," Ambassador Sondland spoke with President Zelensky and recommended that the Ukrainian leader tell President Trump that he """"will leave no stone unturned"""" regarding the political investigations during the upcoming presidential phone call. Ambassador Sondland emailed several top Administration officials", including Secretary of State Pompeo, Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and Secretary Perry," stating that President Zelensky confirmed that he would """"assure"""" President Trump that """"he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will 'turn over every stone.'"""" According to Ambassador Sondland", he was referring in the email to the Burisma/Biden and 2016 election interference investigations. Secretary Perry and Mr. Mulvaney responded affirmatively that the call would soon take place," and Ambassador Sondland testified later that """"everyone was in the loop"""" on plans to condition the White House meeting on the announcement of political investigations beneficial to President Trump. The arrangement troubled the Ukrainian President"," who """"did not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. reelection campaign."""" The President Pressed Zelensky to Do a Political Favor On the morning of July 25", Ambassador Volker sent a text message to President Zelensky's top aide, Mr. Yermak," less than 30 minutes before the presidential call. He stated: """"Heard from White House-assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016"," we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck!"""" Shortly before the call", Ambassador Sondland spoke directly with President Trump. President Zelensky followed this advice during his conversation with President Trump. President Zelensky assured that he would pursue the investigations that President Trump had discussed-into the Bidens and 2016 election interference-and, in turn, pressed for the White House meeting that remained outstanding. The following day, Ambassadors Volker, Sondland," and Taylor met with President Zelensky in Kyiv. The Ukrainian President told them that President Trump had mentioned """"sensitive issues"""" three times during the previous day's phone call. Following the meeting with the Ukrainian leader", Ambassador Sondland had a private," one-on-one conversation with Mr. Yermak in which they discussed """"the issue of investigations."""" He then retired to lunch at an outdoor restaurant terrace with State Department aides where he called President Trump directly from his cellphone. The White House confirmed that the conversation lasted five minutes. At the outset of the call"," President Trump asked Ambassador Sondland whether President Zelensky """"was going to do the investigation"""" that President Trump had raised with President Zelensky the day before. Ambassador Sondland stated that President Zelensky was """"going to do it"""" and """"would do anything you ask him to."""" According to David Holmes", the State Department aide sitting closest to Ambassador Sondland and who overheard the President's voice on the phone, Ambassador Sondland and President Trump spoke only about the investigation in their discussion about Ukraine. The President made no mention of other major issues of importance in Ukraine, including President Zelensky's aggressive anti-corruption reforms and the ongoing war it was fighting against Russian-led forces in eastern Ukraine. After hanging up the phone," Ambassador Sondland explained to Mr. Holmes that President Trump """"did not give a shit about Ukraine."""" Rather"," the President cared only about """"big stuff"""" that benefitted him personally"," like """"the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pitching", and that President Trump had pushed for in his July 25 call with the Ukrainian leader. Ambassador Sondland did not recall referencing Biden specifically, but he did not dispute Mr. Holmes' recollection of the call with the President or Ambassador Sondland's subsequent discussion with Mr. Holmes. The President's Representatives Ratcheted up Pressure on the Ukrainian President In the weeks following the July 25 call, the President's hand-picked representatives increased the President's pressure campaign on Ukrainian government officials-in person, over the phone, and by text message-to secure a public announcement of the investigations beneficial to President Trump's reelection campaign. In discussions with Ukrainian officials, Ambassador Sondland understood that President Trump did not require that Ukraine conduct investigations as a prerequisite for the White House meeting so much as publicly announce the investigations-making clear that the goal was not the investigations, but the political benefit Trump would derive from their announcement and the cloud they might put over a political opponent. On August 2, President Zelensky's advisor, Mr. Yermak, traveled to Madrid to meet Mr. Giuliani in person. There, they agreed that Ukraine would issue a public statement, and they discussed potential dates for a White House meeting. A few days later," Ambassador Volker told Mr. Giuliani that it """"would be good"""" if Mr. Giuliani would report to """"the boss", President Trump," about """"the results"""" of his Madrid discussion so that President Trump would finally agree to a White House visit by President Zelensky. On August 9", Ambassador Volker and Mr. Giuliani spoke twice by phone, and Ambassador Sondland spoke twice to the White House for a total of about 20 minutes. In a text message to Ambassador Volker later that day, Ambassador Sondland wrote," """"I think potus [sic] really wants the deliverable", which Ambassador Sondland acknowledged was the public statement announcing the two political investigations sought by President Trump and Mr. Giuliani. The following day, Ambassador Sondland briefed State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, a top advisor to Secretary Pompeo, on these discussions about President Zelensky issuing a statement that would include an announcement of the two political investigations. Ambassador Sondland also emailed Secretary Pompeo directly, copying the State Department's executive secretary and Mr. Brechbuhl, to inform them about the agreement for President Zelensky to give the press conference. He expected to see a draft of the statement," which would be """"delivered for our review in a day or two."""" Ambassador Sondland noted his hope that the draft statement would """"make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation."""" On August 12", Mr. Yermak sent the proposed statement to Ambassador Volker, but it lacked specific references to the two investigations politically beneficial to President Trump's reelection campaign. The following morning, Ambassadors Sondland and Volker spoke with Mr. Giuliani," who made clear that if the statement """"doesn't say Burisma and 2016"," it's not credible."""" Ambassador Volker revised the statement following this direction to include those references and returned it to the Ukrainian President's aide. Mr. Yermak balked at getting drawn into U.S. politics and asked Ambassador Volker whether the United States had inquired about investigations through any appropriate Department of Justice channels. The answer was no"," and several witnesses testified that a request to a foreign country to investigate a U.S. citizen """"for political reasons"""" goes """"against everything"""" the United States sought to promote in eastern Europe"," specifically the rule of law. Ambassador Volker eventually agreed with Mr. Yermak that the announcement of the Biden/Burisma and 2016 elections investigations would """"look like it would play into our domestic politics"," so the statement was temporarily """"shelved."""" Nevertheless", Ambassador Sondland, in accordance with President Trump's wishes, continued to pursue the statement into early September 2019. Ukrainians Inquired about the President's Hold on Security Assistance Once President Trump placed security assistance on hold in July," """"it was inevitable that it was eventually going to come out."""" On July 25"," DOD officials learned that diplomats at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington had made multiple overtures to DOD and the State Department """"asking about security assistance."""" Separately", two different contacts at the Ukrainian Embassy approached Ambassador Volker's special advisor, Catherine Croft," to ask her in confidence about the hold. Ms. Croft was surprised at the effectiveness of their """"diplomatic tradecraft"," noting that they """"found out very early on"""" that the United States was withholding critical military aid to Ukraine. By mid-August", before the freeze on aid became public, Lt. Col. Vindman had also received inquiries from an official at the Ukrainian Embassy. The hold remained in place throughout August against the unanimous judgment of American officials focused on Ukraine policy. Without an explanation for the hold, which ran contrary to the recommendation of all relevant agencies, and with President Trump already conditioning a White House visit on the announcement of the political investigations, it became increasingly apparent to multiple witnesses that the military aid was also being withheld in exchange for the announcement of those. As both Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Holmes would later testify," it became as clear as """"two plus two equals four."""" On August 22", Ambassador Sondland emailed Secretary Pompeo again, recommending a plan for a potential meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky in Warsaw," Poland on September 1. Ambassador Sondland noted that President Zelensky should """"look him in the eye"""" and tell President Trump that once new prosecutorial officials were in place in Ukraine"," """"Zelensky should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to Potus and the U.S."""" Ambassador Sondland testified that this was a reference to the political investigations that President Trump discussed on the July 25 call"," that Secretary Pompeo had listened to. Ambassador Sondland hoped this would """"break the logjam""""-the hold on critical security assistance to Ukraine. Secretary Pompeo replied three minutes later: """"Yes."""" The President's Security Assistance Hold Became Public On August 28", Politico published a story revealing President Trump's weeks-long hold on U.S. military assistance to Ukraine. Senior Ukrainian officials expressed grave concern, deeply worried about the practical impact on their efforts to fight Russian aggression, but also about the public message it sent to the Russian government, which would almost certainly seek to exploit any real or perceived crack in U.S. resolve toward Ukraine. On August 29, at the urging of National Security Advisor Bolton," Ambassador Taylor wrote a first-person cable to Secretary Pompeo. This was the only first-person cable the Ambassador had ever sent in his decades of government service. He explained the """"folly"""" of withholding security assistance to Ukraine as it fought a hot war against Russia on its borders. He wrote that he """"could not and would not defend such a policy."""" Ambassador Taylor stated that Secretary Pompeo may have carried the cable with him to a meeting at the White House. The same day that Ambassador Taylor sent his cable", President Trump cancelled his planned trip to Warsaw for a World War II commemoration event, where he was scheduled to meet with President Zelensky. Vice President Pence traveled in his place. Ambassador Sondland also traveled to Warsaw and, at a pre-briefing discussion with the Vice President before he met President Zelensky," Ambassador Sondland raised the issue of the hold on security assistance. He told Vice President Pence that he was concerned that the security assistance """"had become tied to the issue of investigations"""" and that """"everything is being held up until these statements get made."""" Vice President Pence nodded in response", apparently expressing neither surprise nor dismay at the linkage between the two. At the meeting, President Zelensky expressed concern that even an appearance of wavering support from the United States for Ukraine could embolden Russia. Vice President Pence reiterated U.S. support for Ukraine, but could not promise that the hold would be lifted. Vice President Pence said he would relay his support for lifting the hold to President Trump so a decision could be made on security assistance as soon as possible. Vice President Pence spoke with President Trump that evening, but the hold was not lifted. Following this meeting, Ambassador Sondland pulled aside President Zelensky's advisor, Mr. Yermak, to explain that the hold on security assistance was conditioned on the public announcement of the Burisma/Biden and the 2016 election interference investigations. After learning of the conversation," Ambassador Taylor texted Ambassador Sondland: """"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?"""" The two then spoke by phone. Ambassador Sondland explained that he had previously made a """"mistake"""" in telling Ukrainian officials that only the White House meeting was conditioned on a public announcement of the political investigations beneficial to President Trump. He clarified that """"everything""""-the White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars of security assistance to Ukraine-was now conditioned on the announcement. President Trump wanted President Zelensky in a """"public box", which Ambassador Taylor understood to mean that President Trump required that President Zelensky make a public announcement about the investigations and that a private commitment would not do. On September 7, President Trump and Ambassador Sondland spoke. Ambassador Sondland stated to his colleagues that the President said," """"there was no quid pro quo", but that President Zelensky would be required to announce the investigations in order for the hold on security assistance to be lifted," """"and he should want to do it."""" Ambassador Sondland passed on a similar message directly to President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak that"," """"although this was not a quid pro quo", if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate, referring to the hold on security assistance. Arrangements were made for the Ukrainian President to make a public statement during an interview on CNN. After speaking with Ambassador Sondland," Ambassador Taylor texted Ambassadors Sondland and Volker: """"As I said on the phone"," I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign."""" Notwithstanding his long-held understanding that the White House meeting was conditioned on the public announcement of two political investigations desired by President Trump-and not broader anti-corruption concerns-Ambassador Sondland responded hours later: Bill", I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text. If you still have concerns, I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or [Secretary Pompeo] a call to discuss with them directly. Thanks. Ambassador Sondland's subsequent testimony revealed this text to be a false exculpatory-an untruthful statement that can later be used to conceal incriminating information. In his public testimony, Ambassador Sondland testified that the President's direction to withhold a presidential telephone call and a White House meeting for President Zelensky were both quid pro quos designed to pressure Ukraine to announce the investigations. He also testified that he developed a clear understanding that the military aid was also conditioned on the investigations, that it was as simple as 2+2=4. Sondland confirmed that his clear understanding was unchanged after speaking with President Trump, which he then communicated to the Ukrainians-President Zelensky had to publicly announce the two investigations if he wanted to get the meeting or the military aid. In Ambassador Sondland's testimony, he was not clear on whether he had one conversation with the President in which the subject of a quid pro quo came up, or two, or on precisely which date the conversation took place during the period of September 6 through 9. In one version of the conversation which Ambassador Sondland suggested may have taken place on September 9," he claimed that the President answered an open question about what he wanted from Ukraine with an immediate denial-""""no quid pro quo."""" In another", he admitted that the President told him that President Zelensky should go to a microphone and announce the investigations, and that he should want to do so-effectively confirming a quid pro quo. Both Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morrison, relying on their contemporaneous notes, testified that the call between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump occurred on September 7," which is further confirmed by Ambassador Sondland's own text message on September 8 in which he wrote that he had """"multiple convos"""" with President Zelensky and President Trump. A call on September 9", which would have occurred in the middle of the night, is at odds with the weight of the evidence and not backed up by any records the White House was willing to provide Ambassador Sondland. Regardless of the date, Ambassador Sondland did not contest telling both Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor of a conversation he had with the President in which the President reaffirmed Ambassador Sondland's understanding of the quid pro quo for the military aid. As Ambassador Sondland acknowledged bluntly in his conversation with Mr. Holmes," President Trump's sole interest with respect to Ukraine was the """"big stuff"""" that benefited him personally", such as the investigations into former Vice President Biden, and not President Zelensky's promises of transparency and reform. The President's Scheme Unraveled By early September, President Zelensky was ready to make a public announcement of the two investigations to secure a White House meeting and the military assistance his country desperately needed. He proceeded to book an interview on CNN during which he could make such an announcement, but other events soon intervened. On September 9, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committees on Oversight and Reform, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs announced an investigation into the scheme by President Trump and his personal attorney," Mr. Giuliani """"to improperly pressure the Ukrainian government to assist the President's bid for reelection."""" The Committees sent document production and preservation requests to the White House and the State Department related to the investigation. NSC staff members believed this investigation might have had """"the effect of releasing the hold"""" on Ukraine military assistance because it would have been """"potentially politically challenging"""" to """"justify that hold."""" Later that day"," the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG) sent a letter to Chairman Schiff and Ranking Member Nunes notifying the Committee that a whistleblower had filed a complaint on August 12 that the ICIG had determined to be both an """"urgent concern"""" and """"credible."""" Nevertheless", the Acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) took the unprecedented step of withholding the complaint from the Congressional Intelligence Committees, in coordination with the White House and the Department of Justice. The White House had been aware of the whistleblower complaint for several weeks, and press reports indicate that the President was briefed on it in late August. The ICIG's notification to Congress of the complaint's existence, and the announcement of a separate investigation into the same subject matter, telegraphed to the White House that attempts to condition the security assistance on the announcement of the political investigations beneficial to President Trump-and efforts to cover up that misconduct-would not last. On September 11, in the face of growing public and Congressional scrutiny, President Trump lifted the hold on security assistance to Ukraine. As with the implementation of the hold, no clear reason was given. By the time the President ordered the release of security assistance to Ukraine, DOD was unable to spend approximately 14 percent of the funds appropriated by Congress for Fiscal Year 2019. Congress had to pass a new law to extend the funding in order to ensure the full amount could be used by Ukraine to defend itself. Even after the hold was lifted, President Zelensky still intended to sit for an interview with CNN in order to announce the investigations-indeed, he still wanted the White House meeting. At the urging of Ambassador Taylor, President Zelensky cancelled the CNN interview on September 18 or 19. The White House meeting, however," still has not occurred. The President's Chief of Staff Confirmed Aid was Conditioned on Investigations The conditioning of military aid to Ukraine on the investigations sought by the President was as clear to Ambassador Sondland as """"two plus two equals four."""" In fact", the President's own Acting Chief of Staff, someone who meets with him daily, admitted that he had discussed security assistance with the President and that his decision to withhold it was directly tied to his desire to get Ukraine to conduct a political investigation. On October 17, at a press briefing in the White House, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney confirmed that President Trump withheld the essential military aid for Ukraine as leverage to pressure Ukraine to investigate the conspiracy theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. As Dr. Hill made clear in her testimony, this false narrative has been promoted by President Putin to deflect away from Russia's systemic interference in our election and to drive a wedge between the United States and a key partner. According to Mr. Mulvaney," President Trump """"[a]bsolutely"""" mentioned """"corruption related to the DNC server"""" in connection with the security assistance during his July 25 call. Mr. Mulvaney also stated that the server was part of """"why we held up the money."""" After a reporter attempted to clarify this explicit acknowledgement of a quid pro quo"," Mr. Mulvaney replied: """"We do that all the time with foreign policy."""" He added"," """"I have news for everybody: get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy."""" Ambassador Taylor testified that in his decades of military and diplomatic service", he had never seen another example of foreign aid conditioned on the personal or political interests of the President. Rather," """"we condition assistance on issues that will improve our foreign policy", serve our foreign policy, ensure that taxpayers' money is well-spent, not specific investigations designed to benefit the political interests of the President of the United States. In contrast, President Trump does not appear to believe there is any such limitation on his power to use White House meetings, military aid or other official acts to procure foreign help in his reelection. When asked by a reporter on October 3 what he had hoped President Zelensky would do following their July 25 call," President Trump responded: """"Well", I would think that, if they were honest about it," they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer."""" II. The President Obstructed the Impeachment Inquiry by Instructing Witnesses and Agencies to Ignore Subpoenas for Documents and Testimony An Unprecedented Effort to Obstruct an Impeachment Inquiry Donald Trump is the first President in the history of the United States to seek to completely obstruct an impeachment inquiry undertaken by the House of Representatives under Article I of the Constitution"," which vests the House with the """"sole Power of Impeachment."""" He has publicly and repeatedly rejected the authority of Congress to conduct oversight of his actions and has directly challenged the authority of the House to conduct an impeachment inquiry into his actions regarding Ukraine. President Trump ordered federal agencies and officials to disregard all voluntary requests for documents and defy all duly authorized subpoenas for records. He also directed all federal officials in the Executive Branch not to testify-even when compelled. No other President has flouted the Constitution and power of Congress to conduct oversight to this extent. No President has claimed for himself the right to deny the House's authority to conduct an impeachment proceeding", control the scope of a power exclusively vested in the House, and forbid any and all cooperation from the Executive Branch. Even President Richard Nixon-who obstructed Congress by refusing to turn over key evidence-accepted the authority of Congress to conduct an impeachment inquiry and permitted his aides and advisors to produce documents and testify to Congressional committees. Despite President Trump's unprecedented and categorical commands, the House gathered overwhelming evidence of his misconduct from courageous individuals who were willing to follow the law, comply with duly authorized subpoenas, and tell the truth. In response, the President engaged in a brazen effort to publicly attack and intimidate these witnesses. If left unanswered, President Trump's ongoing effort to thwart Congress' impeachment power risks doing grave harm to the institution of Congress, the balance of power between our branches of government, and the Constitutional order that the President and every Member of Congress have sworn to protect and defend. Constitutional Authority for Congressional Oversight and Impeachment The House's Constitutional and legal authority to conduct an impeachment inquiry is clear," as is the duty of the President to cooperate with the House's exercise of this authority. Article I of the U.S. Constitution gives the House of Representatives the """"sole Power of Impeachment."""" The Framers intended the impeachment power to be an essential check on a President who might engage in corruption or abuse of power. Congress is empowered to conduct oversight and investigations to carry out its authorities under Article I. Because the impeachment power is a core component of the nation's Constitutional system of checks and balances", Congress' investigative authority is at its zenith during an impeachment inquiry. The Supreme Court has made clear that Congress' authority to investigate includes the authority to compel the production of information by issuing subpoenas," a power the House has delegated to its committees pursuant to its Constitutional authority to """"determine the Rules of its Proceedings."""" Congress has also enacted statutes to support its power to investigate and oversee the Executive Branch. These laws impose criminal and other penalties on those who fail to comply with inquiries from Congress or block others from doing so", and they reflect the broader Constitutional requirement to cooperate with Congressional investigations. Unlike President Trump, past Presidents who were the subject of impeachment inquiries-including Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton-recognized and, to varying degrees, complied with information requests and subpoenas. President Nixon, for example, agreed to let his staff testify voluntarily in the Senate Watergate investigation," stating: """"All members of the White House Staff will appear voluntarily when requested by the committee. They will testify under oath"," and they will answer fully all proper questions."""" President Nixon also produced documents in response to the House's subpoenas as part of its impeachment inquiry", including more than 30 transcripts of White House recordings and notes from meetings with the President. When President Nixon withheld tape recordings and produced heavily edited and inaccurate records, the House Judiciary Committee approved an article of impeachment for obstruction. The President's Categorical Refusal to Comply Even before the House of Representatives launched its investigation regarding Ukraine, President Trump rejected the authority of Congress to investigate his actions, proclaiming," """"We're fighting all the subpoenas"," and """"I have an Article II"," where I have the right to do whatever I want as president."""" When the Intelligence", Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs Committees began reviewing the President's actions as part of the House's impeachment inquiry, the President repeatedly challenged the legitimacy of the investigation in word and deed. His rhetorical attacks appeared intended not only to dispute reports of his misconduct, but to persuade the American people that the House lacks authority to investigate the President. On September 26," President Trump argued that Congress should not be """"allowed"""" to impeach him under the Constitution and that there """"should be a way of stopping it-maybe legally"," through the courts."""" A common theme of his defiance has been his claims that Congress is acting in an unprecedented way and using unprecedented rules. However", the House has been following the same investigative rules that Republicans championed when they were in control. On October 8," White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Chairmen of the investigating Committees confirming that President Trump directed his entire Administration not to cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry. Mr. Cipollone wrote: """"President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances."""" Mr. Cipollone's letter advanced remarkably politicized arguments and legal theories unsupported by the Constitution", judicial precedent, and more than 200 years of history. If allowed to stand, the President's defiance, as justified by Mr. Cipollone, would represent an existential threat to the nation's Constitutional system of checks and balances, separation of powers, and rule of law. The President's Refusal to Produce Any and All Subpoenaed Documents Following President Trump's categorical order, not a single document has been produced by the White House, the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, or the Department of Energy in response to 71 specific, individualized requests or demands for records in their possession, custody, or control. These subpoenas remain in full force and effect. These agencies and offices also blocked many current and former officials from producing records directly to the Committees. Certain witnesses defied the President's sweeping, categorical, and baseless order and identified the substance of key documents. For example, Ambassador Gordon Sondland attached ten exhibits to his written hearing testimony reflecting reproductions of certain communications with high-level Administration officials, including Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, former National Security Advisor John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. Other witnesses identified numerous additional documents that the President and various agencies are withholding that are directly relevant to the impeachment inquiry. Like the White House, the Department of State refused to produce a single document in response to its subpoena, even though there is no legal basis for the Department's actions. In fact, on November 22, the Department was forced to produce 99 pages of emails, letters, notes, timelines, and news articles to a non-partisan, nonprofit ethics watchdog organization pursuant to a court order in a lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Although limited in scope, this production affirms that the Department is withholding responsive documents from Congress without any valid legal basis. The President's Refusal to Allow Top Aides to Testify No other President in history has issued an order categorically directing the entire Executive Branch not to testify before Congress, including in the context of an impeachment inquiry. President Trump issued just such an order. As reflected in Mr. Cipollone's letter, President Trump directed government witnesses to violate their legal obligations and defy House subpoenas-regardless of their offices or positions. President Trump even extended his order to former officials no longer employed by the federal government. This Administration-wide effort to prevent all witnesses from providing testimony was coordinated and comprehensive. At President Trump's direction, twelve current or former Administration officials refused to testify as part of the House's impeachment inquiry, ten of whom did so in defiance of duly authorized subpoenas: - Mick Mulvaney, Acting White House Chief of Staff - Robert B. Blair, Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff - Ambassador John Bolton, Former National Security Advisor - John A. Eisenberg, Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs and Legal Advisor, National Security Council - Michael Ellis, Senior Associate Counsel to the President and Deputy Legal Advisor, National Security Council - Preston Wells Griffith, Senior Director for International Energy and Environment, National Security Council - Dr. Charles M. Kupperman, Former Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, National Security Council - Russell T. Vought, Acting Director, Office of Management and Budget - Michael Duffey, Associate Director for National Security Programs, Office of Management and Budget - Brian McCormack, Associate Director for Natural Resources, Energy, and Science, Office of Management and Budget - T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, Counselor, Department of State - Secretary Rick Perry," Department of Energy These witnesses were warned that their refusal to testify """"shall constitute evidence that may be used against you in a contempt proceeding"""" and """"may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President."""" The President's Unsuccessful Attempts to Block Other Key Witnesses Despite President Trump's orders that no Executive Branch employees should cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry", multiple key officials complied with duly authorized subpoenas and provided critical testimony at depositions and public hearings. These officials not only served their nation honorably, but they fulfilled their oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. In addition to the President's broad orders seeking to prohibit all Executive Branch employees from testifying, many of these witnesses were personally directed by senior political appointees not to cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry. These directives frequently cited or enclosed copies of Mr. Cipollone's October 8 letter conveying the President's order not to comply. For example, the State Department, relying on President Trump's order, attempted to block Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch from testifying, but she fulfilled her legal obligations by appearing at a deposition on October 11 and a hearing on November 15. More than a dozen current and former officials followed her courageous example by testifying at depositions and public hearings over the course of the last two months. The testimony from these witnesses produced overwhelming and clear evidence of President Trump's misconduct, which is described in detail in the first section of this report. The President's Intimidation of Witnesses President Trump publicly attacked and intimidated witnesses who came forward to comply with duly authorized subpoenas and testify about his misconduct, raising grave concerns about potential violations of criminal laws intended to protect witnesses appearing before Congressional proceedings. For example, the President attacked: Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who served the United States honorably for decades as a U.S. diplomat and anti-corruption advocate in posts around the world under six different Presidents; Ambassador Bill Taylor, who graduated at the top of his class at West Point, served as an infantry commander in Vietnam, and earned a Bronze Star and an Air Medal with a V device for valor; Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, an active-duty Army officer for more than 20 years who earned a Purple Heart for wounds he sustained in an improvised explosive device attack in Iraq, as well as the Combat Infantryman Badge; and Jennifer Williams, who is Vice President Mike Pence's top advisor on Europe and Russia and has a distinguished record of public service under the Bush, Obama, and Trump Administrations. The President engaged in this effort to intimidate these public servants to prevent them from cooperating with Congress' impeachment inquiry. He issued threats, openly discussed possible retaliation, made insinuations about their character and patriotism, and subjected them to mockery and derision-when they deserved the opposite. The President's attacks were broadcast to millions of Americans-including witnesses' families, friends," and coworkers. It is a federal crime to intimidate or seek to intimidate any witness appearing before Congress. This prohibition applies to anyone who knowingly """"uses intimidation", threatens," or corruptly persuades"""" another person in order to """"influence", delay," or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding."""" Violations of this law can carry a criminal sentence of up to 20 years in prison. In addition to his relentless attacks on witnesses who testified in connection with the House's impeachment inquiry"," the President also repeatedly threatened and attacked a member of the Intelligence Community who filed an anonymous whistleblower complaint raising an """"urgent concern"""" that """"appeared credible"""" regarding the President's conduct. The whistleblower filed the complaint confidentially with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community", as authorized by the relevant whistleblower law. Federal law prohibits the Inspector General from revealing the whistleblower's identity. Federal law also protects the whistleblower from retaliation. In more than 100 public statements about the whistleblower over a period of just two months, the President publicly questioned the whistleblower's motives, disputed the accuracy of the whistleblower's account, and encouraged others to reveal the whistleblower's identity. Most chillingly, the President issued a threat against the whistleblower and those who provided information to the whistleblower regarding the President's misconduct, suggesting that they could face the death penalty for treason. The President's campaign of intimidation risks discouraging witnesses from coming forward voluntarily, complying with mandatory subpoenas for documents and testimony," and disclosing potentially incriminating evidence in this inquiry and future Congressional investigations."""
"The five most incisive excerpts from the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment report  Link to Image Democrats on the House Intelligence Committeereleased their report detailing President Trump's dealings with Ukraine on Tuesday as the impeachment inquiry moves to the House Judiciary Committee. FULL TEXT The 300-page report outlines the evidence the committee has collected against Trump in his call with Ukraine, as well as efforts by the administration to prevent key witnesses from testifying and to withhold documents demanded by impeachment investigators. The findings could be the basis for the Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against the president. Judiciary Committee hearings begin Wednesday, and the panel could vote on articles of impeachment this month. Here are the most incisive excerpts from the report. The report accuses Trump of using his official power for personal benefit ""The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the US presidential election process, and endangered US national security."" It pounces on Mulvaney's 'get over it' quote ""The question presented by the set of facts enumerated in this report may be as simple as that posed by the President and his chief of staff's brazenness:  is the remedy of impeachment warranted for a president who would use the power of his office to coerce foreign interference in a US election, or is that now a mere perk of the office that Americans must simply 'get over'?"" The report argues Trump's misconduct goes beyond the July 25 phone call ""In the weeks following the July 25 call, the President's hand-picked representatives increased the President's pressure campaign on Ukrainian government officials-in person, over the phone, and by text message-to secure a public announcement of the investigations beneficial to President Trump's reelection campaign."" In refusing to turn over evidence, the report says Trump 'flouted' the Constitution ""No other President has flouted the Constitution and power of Congress to conduct oversight to this extent.  No President has claimed for himself the right to deny the House's authority to conduct an impeachment proceeding, control the scope of a power exclusively vested in the House, and forbid any and all cooperation from the Executive Branch.  Even President Richard Nixon-who obstructed Congress by refusing to turn over key evidence-accepted the authority of Congress to conduct an impeachment inquiry and permitted his aides and advisors to produce documents and testify to Congressional committees."" The report suggests Trump may have intimidated witnesses in his public attacks on officials who testified ""The President engaged in this effort to intimidate these public servants to prevent them from cooperating with Congress' impeachment inquiry.

"Alleged drug trafficker mentioned in connection with David Ortiz shooting case is arrested in Colombia  An alleged drug trafficker whose name surfaced over the summer in connection with the shooting of Red Sox legend David Ortiz was arrested Monday in Colombia on a US warrant charging him with cocaine and heroin distribution, authorities said. The attorney general's office in Colombia announced the arrest of César Emilio Peralta, 44, also known as ""El Abusador,"" or ""The Abuser,"" in a statement Monday. Peralta was the subject of an extradition request by federal prosecutors in South Florida and Puerto Rico. He was arrested Monday morning in the Boca Grande section of Colombia, the statement. FULL TEXT While the Florida indictment alleges Peralta and several other suspects conspired to distribute cocaine, knowing it would be imported into the US, Peralta's name was mentioned in August in connection with the Globe's reporting on the shooting of Ortiz.  The retired slugger was shot in the back at close range in June as he sat with friends in a patio  area of a popular night spot in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Ortiz survived, but details of the attack that stunned the sports world have remained shrouded in mystery. Initially, Dominican authorities said Ortiz had been targeted in a botched hit job. But investigators later changed their story, telling reporters the Dominican-born ballplayer, revered as a hero in his native country, was mistakenly shot by assailants targeting another man,  Sixto David Fernández, at the behest of Victor Hugo Gomez Vasquez. Vasquez, authorities said, had allegedly sought to kill Fernández for informing on him roughly a decade ago. The claim prompted widespread skepticism. Ortiz is 6-foot-4 and weighed about 245 pounds at the time of the June shooting. He has a dark complexion, while the light-skinned Fernández is thin and about 5-foot-6. Here's where Peralta figures into the story: Vasquez, before his June 28 arrest in connection with Ortiz's shooting, released a video denying any involvement in the attack and claiming that Fernández was closely tied to Peralta. Vasquez didn't lay blame on anyone for the shooting. Ortiz once owned an apartment in the same luxury tower in Santo Domingo as Peralta. Joe Baerlein, a spokesman for Ortiz, has said Ortiz bought his unit before the tower was built and chose to sell it about five years ago because Peralta bought the penthouse. When they crossed paths, Ortiz and Peralta acknowledged each other, Baerlein said, but Ortiz kept his distance, recognizing the danger of getting too close. ""No one in the Dominican Republic ever wanted to be an enemy of Peralta because everybody knew he was part of this [alleged] drug cartel,'' Baerlein said over the summer on behalf of his client. Baerlein declined to comment on Peralta's arrest Tuesday since he was still gathering information about it. Peralta hasn't been charged in connection with the Ortiz case, and Dominican authorities have presented no evidence linking Peralta to the shooting. Dominican National Police Colonel Frank Felix Duran Mejia told the Globe in August that investigators in the Ortiz shooting case looked into many angles, including possible links to Peralta, but found them meritless. ""Evidently, David was in, how do you Americans say, 'wrong place, wrong time,' and confused for someone else,"" Duran said in an interview at national police headquarters. ""There is no doubt. . . . But, lamentably, people want to hear something else."" A previously released FBI wanted poster said the bureau was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading directly to the arrest and conviction of Peralta. The FBI identified him by an alternative name, Cesar Emilio Peralta-Adamez. ""Cesar Emilio Peralta-Adamez is wanted for his alleged involvement in drug trafficking between 2007 and 2017 in the countries of Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Columbia, and the Continental United States, and Puerto Rico,"" the FBI said in the earlier advisory. In November 2018, the advisory said, ""a federal indictment was issued for Peralta-Adamez in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico after he was charged with Conspiracy to Import a Controlled Substance (Heroin), Conspiracy to Import a Controlled Substance (Cocaine), and Distribution for Purpose of Unlawful Importation (Cocaine)."" Peralta was at the center of an August raid by US and Dominican law enforcement on an alleged drug trafficking and money laundering ring, according to the US Treasury Department. Some 18 suspects, including former major league players Octavio Dotel and Luis Castillo, were arrested or cited in the sweep. But Peralta wasn't captured at the time.

"Finland's prime minister resigns over postal service dispute  Link to Image HELSINKI - Finland's prime minister resigned Tuesday after a key coalition partner withdrew its support from his five-party government following a strike at the country's postal service that spread to the national flag carrier Finnair. Antti Rinne, who only took office in June, has faced heavy criticism in recent days over how he and a fellow Social Democratic minister dealt with a two-week strike of the country's state-owned postal service Posti in November. FULL TEXT Rinne, who used to be a trade union leader, and Sirpa Paatero were accused of giving inaccurate and contradictory information in the run-up to the strike, specifically over the transfer of work contracts for 700 Posti package handlers, which effectively would have led to lower pay. Paatero, a minister who was in charge of state-owned companies, resigned on Friday. Rinne had been under pressure for days over the Posti case and his role in the strike that ended on Nov. 27 after a compromise deal was reached that allowed package handlers to remain under current work contracts for now. He said it became ""obvious"" after Paatero's resignation that the Posti affair, which he described as ""a messy case with plenty issues to be cleared"" wouldn't be settled with the minister's departure. ""My biggest mistake has been that I've trusted only in the information I've been presented with,"" Rinne said, without elaborating. Rinne had accused Posti's senior management for misleading him over potential pay cuts. The strike led to a one-day sympathy strike by the Nordic country's transport sector, including Finnair, which had to cancel almost 300 flights. Rinne, who will remain in post until a successor is decided upon next week, has denied any wrongdoing. His government holds a comfortable majority of 117 seats in the 200-seat Eduskunta, Finland's parliament. His resignation prompted the formal resignation of the Cabinet that is made up of Rinne's Social Democratic Party, the Center Party, the Greens, the Left Alliance, and the Swedish People's Party of Finland. Lawmakers will decide on a new prime minister next week. Until then, the current Cabinet will continue as a caretaker government until a new one takes over as planned on Dec. 13, according to Finnish media. It's unclear whether Rinne will represent Finland at next week's European Union leaders' summit in Brussels. Finland currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU. The Social Democrats retain the power to appoint one of their own to the post of prime minister and are set to decide in the coming days on Rinne's successor. Transport minister Sanna Marin or Antti Lindtman, who leads the Social Democrats' parliamentary grouping, are widely considered to be the most likely successor to Rinne. The Center Party pulled its support from Rinne's government on Monday and urged him either to resign or to face a no-confidence vote. ""There has been lack of trust shown by the Center Party and in discussions today they detailed reasons for that,"" Rinne said in his resignation statement. ""After receiving that reply, I naturally reflected on what that meant for the government and I drew my own conclusions."" Rinne said he would continue as the chairman of the Social Democratic Party at least until next summer's party congress. ""Thanks for the short, but many moments of good cooperation,"" Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said on accepting Rinne's resignation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Court seems ready to curb claims over Montana Superfund site  Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court seemed inclined Tuesday to rule that Montana homeowners who are seeking additional cleanup of arsenic left over from years of copper smelting need the permission of the Environmental Protection Agency. That outcome would be a loss for the homeowners and a win for Atlantic Richfield Co. The BP-owned company is the owner of the shuttered Anaconda smelter that is at the center of a 300-square-mile Superfund site. The company says it has spent $470 million to clean the site. The justices heard arguments over the company's effort to shut down claims in state court that it should have to pay more. Homeowners who are dissatisfied with the EPA-ordered cleanup want Atlantic Richfield to pay for the removal of more arsenic-tainted soil from their properties. A high court ruling for Atlantic Richfield would not end the claims, but it would be significantly harder for the homeowners to pursue their lawsuit in Montana courts. Several justices seemed troubled by the idea that property owners whose land has been contaminated could undertake cleanup without EPA approval. Digging up a yard to put in a sand box for children could ""stir up infected dirt that could harm your neighbors many miles away,"" Chief Justice John Roberts said. Joseph Palmore, the lawyer representing homeowners in Opportunity, Montana, said the EPA has conceded it has ample authority to stop people who take measures that are inconsistent with the cleanup of a Superfund site. But Justice Elena Kagan remarked that it might be hard for the EPA to ""go around and try to figure out who's creating  sand boxes "" on Superfund sites. The EPA is supporting the company at the Supreme Court. The Montana Supreme Court ruled in 2017 that the homeowners could pursue their claims against Atlantic Richfield in state court.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gun background checks are on pace to break record in 2019  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Background checks on gun purchases in the U.S. are climbing toward a record high this year, reflecting what the industry says is a rush by people to buy weapons in reaction to the Democratic presidential candidates' calls for tighter restrictions. By the end of November, more than 25.4 million background checks - generally seen as a strong indicator of gun sales - had been conducted by the FBI, putting 2019 on pace to break the record of 27.5 million set in 2016, the last full year President Barack Obama was in the White House. On Black Friday alone, the FBI ran 202,465 checks. Some analysts question how accurately the background check figures translate into gun sales, since some states run checks on applications for concealed-carry permits, too, and some purchases involve multiple firearms. But the numbers remain the most reliable method of tracking the industry. In the years since President Donald Trump took office, the industry has struggled through what has been referred to as the Trump Slump, a falloff in sales that reflected little worry among gun owners about gun control efforts. But with the 2020 presidential election less than a year out and virtually every Democratic candidate offering proposals to restrict access to firearms, fears appear to be driving up sales again. ""The Trump Slump is real, but the politics of guns has changed a little bit over the last year,"" said Adam Winkler, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law and an expert on gun rights and politics. ""As we're coming up upon another presidential election, Donald Trump is vulnerable, and the Democratic presidential contenders are falling all over themselves to propose more aggressive gun reforms than their opponents."" Trump has been viewed as one of the most gun-friendly presidents in modern history and has boasted of strong support from the National Rifle Association. He has addressed every one of its annual conventions since the 2016 campaign, and the powerful gun lobby pumped about $30 million into efforts to elect him. Still, hopes of expanded gun rights under Trump's watch haven't materialized. Legislation that would make it easier to buy silencers stalled in Congress. In addition, Trump pushed through a ban on bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic rifles to mimic machine-gun fire. The gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas in 2017 in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history used such a device. The industry has been going through one of its toughest periods, with some gunmakers, such as Remington Arms, filing for bankruptcy. More recently, Smith & Wesson's parent company, American Outdoor Brands, announced plans to spin off its firearms unit, and Colt said it would suspend production of AR-15 rifles. Amid some high-profile mass shootings in recent years, especially the Parkland school attack in Florida that left 17 people dead, gun control advocates have gained some momentum. The crowded field of Democrats running for the White House has offered a variety of proposals to curtail gun rights. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, whose state has seen repeated mass shootings this past year, went so far as to push for a mandatory buyback program for AR- and AK-style rifles before dropping out of the race, stoking gun owners' fears when he declared during a debate, ""Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47."" The gun industry says the figures from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System reflect the Second Amendment politics of the White House race. ""Americans are choosing to invest their hard-earned dollars in their ability to exercise their rights and buy the firearms they want before gun control politicians attempt to regulate away that ability,"" said Mark Oliva, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents the gun industry. Still, some experts took issue with the figures and said it is premature to declare the Trump Slump is over. ""These numbers cannot be taken be taken at face value,"" said Jurgen Brauer, a retired business professor and now chief economist at Small Arms Analytics, which consults on the firearms industry. Brauer said the numbers are increasingly skewed by states such as Kentucky that also run background checks when they issue or renew a permit to carry a concealed firearm. In October, for example, the state ran more than 280,000 checks through the NICS system for permits. ""That number has been rising over time as increasingly states check with some frequency on their existing permits,"" Brauer said. The NICS system was created after passage of the Brady Bill, which mandated background checks to buy a firearm. Convicted felons, domestic abusers and people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution are among those who cannot legally purchase a weapon. In 1999, the first full year the system was used, just over 9 million background checks were conducted.

"North Korea warns US of an unwelcome 'Christmas gift'  Link to Image TOKYO - North Korea said on Tuesday that dialogue with the United States had been nothing but a ''foolish trick'' and warned Washington it could be on the receiving of an unwelcome Christmas gift. FULL TEXT The North Korean regime has given the United States until the end of the year to drop its ''hostile policy,'' come up with a new approach to talks, and offer concessions in return for its decision to end nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests in 2018. But a recent decision by the United States to postpone a joint air drill with South Korea clearly hasn't satisfied Pyongyang. Ri Thae Song, vice foreign minister in charge of US affairs, accused Washington of trying to buy time by calling for a ''sustained and substantial dialogue,'' but he rejected this approach. ''The dialogue touted by the US is, in essence, nothing but a foolish trick hatched to keep the DPRK bound to dialogue and use it in favor of the political situation and election in the US,'' he said, referring to his country by its official name the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ''The DPRK has heard more than enough dialogue rhetoric raised by the US whenever it is driven into a tight corner. So, no one will lend an ear to the US any longer.'' Ri then again reminded the United States of the fast-approaching deadline, effectively repeating a veiled threat to resume long-range missile tests. ''The DPRK has done its utmost with maximum perseverance not to backtrack from the important steps it has taken on its own initiative,'' he said in a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency. ''What is left to be done now is the US option and it is entirely up to the US what Christmas gift it will select to get.'' North Korea has a history of timing launches with an eye on international developments and even US holidays. Last week, North Korea chose Thanksgiving Day to launch two projectiles from what it called a ''super large multiple-rocket launcher,'' marking the 14th test of short-range rockets or missiles it has undertaken this year. On July 4, 2017, North Korea conducted its first ICBM test, the Hwasong-14, with leader Kim Jong Un describing it as a ''gift package'' for the Americans on their Independence Day. North Korea has also dialed up the military threats in recent months, suggesting it may soon launch a ballistic missile in the direction of Japan. When Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described last week's launch as a threat to the region and the world, but described the projectiles as ballistic missiles, North Korea responded by calling him the worst idiot in the world and the most stupid man in history. ''Abe may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future and under his nose,'' KCNA said Saturday. ''Abe is none other than a perfect imbecile and a political dwarf.''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prominent Conn. lawyer completes one month prison sentence in college admissions scandal  A prominent lawyer sentenced in October to a month in prison for his role in the college admissions cheating scandal made it home for Thanksgiving, and a judge on Tuesday ordered authorities to return his passport, legal filings show. FULL TEXT Gordon Caplan, 53, was sprung from federal custody on Nov. 22, according to court records and the Federal Bureau of Prisons website. Caplan, a resident of tony Greenwich, Conn. whom The American Lawyer magazine named ""Dealmaker of the Year"" in 2018, was sentenced in federal court in Boston to serve a month in prison for paying a $75,000 bribe to pad his daughter's ACT score. He was also ordered to pay a $50,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service. On Tuesday, Judge Indira Talwani approved Caplan's motion for the return of his passport, which he surrendered in March following his arrest. ""Since my arrest, I've been consumed with why I engaged in this type of conduct,"" Caplan said in court during his sentencing hearing. ""I come to the painful realization that this whole episode was, at least in large part, my own ambition for my daughter going to college."" Caplan's one of dozens of defendants jammed up in the breathtaking scheme, in which wealthy parents cut large checks to admitted ringleader William ""Rick"" Singer to have their children falsely designated as athletic recruits at fancy schools, or to boost their kids' SAT and ACT scores. Singer's admitted to his starring role in the ruse and awaits sentencing. During Caplan's sentencing, his lawyer noted that he had refused Singer's offer to use the so-called ""side door,"" another name for the fake recruit portion of the scheme. The sprawling probe has ensnared a number of business leaders and Hollywood celebrities, including screen legends Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin. Huffman, who starred in the hit TV series ""Desperate Housewives"" and floored critics with her gutsy performance in the film ""Transamerica,"" served less than two weeks behind bars for paying a $15,000 bribe to pad her daughter's SAT score. Huffman also had to cough up a $30,000 fine, and she was ordered to perform 250 hours of community service. Loughlin and her husband, the fashion mogul Mossimo Giannulli, are facing charges for allegedly paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to get their daughters into USC as bogus crew recruits. The couple has pleaded not guilty. One of Loughlin's daughters caused a social media stir on Sunday when she posted a video to her wildly popular YouTube channel, her first video post since the arrest of her parents.

"Rutgers OKs deal to bring back Schiano as football coach  Link to Image NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - After an on-again, off-again courtship, Greg Schiano is back as Rutgers football coach. Of course, it didn't go off without a Rutgers-like hitch. There was a glitch with microphones at a public hearing before the deal became official. The university's Board of Governors on Tuesday approved an eight-year, $32 million contract to bring back the former Scarlet Knights coach to lead the downtrodden program that has lost 21 straight Big Ten Conference games and won seven others over the last three seasons. The 53-year-old Schiano will be introduced at a news conference on Wednesday. The agreement, which was signed by Schiano and athletic director Pat Hobbs on Saturday and announced on Sunday, will give the coach a $4 million annual salary and $7.7 million annually to hire a staff, with the amount increasing 3% annually. The incentive-laden contract runs through February 2028. The board's vote on telephone conference call took less than 15 seconds. The 20 minutes before the vote were mostly procedure measures and a chance for some to vent about problems at the university not related to football. Five people addressed the board on issues ranging from a new contract for more than 1,100 physicians associated with the university, spending money on an athletic department that annually loses money and a failure of the board to release terms of Schiano's deal before approving it. Michael Crockford, a 1998 Rutgers graduate, was the first to speak. He was cut off several times by feedback from the microphone. He objected to spending $50 million on football when it might be better spent on academics. The mic problem forced the board secretary to move the final four speakers away from the podium in the middle of the room to the board table for their two minutes of time to comment on the contract. The actual approval vote couldn't be heard because the final speaker refused to stop speaking after his limit had expired. A board member eventually asked for the memorandum to be voted on and it passed without the audience hearing the vote. The meeting was then adjourned. Schiano also would receive a $100,000 bonus if the Scarlet Knights made the conference title game and $200,000 if they won the title. Getting to a postseason bowl with a .500 record or better would yield a $75,000 bonus for a Group A bowl, $100,000 for a Group B bowl or $150,000 for a New Year's Six bowl appearance. The incentives jump to $200,000 for making the college football playoff, $250,000 for appearing in the title game and $350,000 for winning the national title. There are also incentives for winning conference coach of the year, ticket sales and academic achievement of the football team. Schiano will get a $15,000 stipend for an automobile, a country club membership and use of a private box for games. Schiano's family is authorized to fly on the team charter for games. He will be allowed to use private air transportation for recruiting if it is available. If not, he is authorized to fly first class. The deal was reached a week after talks to bring back Schiano fell apart when the two sides couldn't agree on financial commitments by the school toward improved facilities and infrastructure. An outpouring of frustration by fans and boosters and some call for Hobbs to be fired appeared to spur the resumption of talks. Schiano, a New Jersey native, went 68-67 at Rutgers from 2001-11 and turned the Scarlet Knights into consistent winners after years of being one of the worst major college football programs in the country. Success under Schiano helped Rutgers land an invitation to the Big Ten, and it joined the lucrative Power Five conference in 2014. His success came in the Big East Conference and it will be interesting to see if he can do the same thing in the Big Ten, a 14-team conference led by Ohio State, Penn State, Michigan and Wisconsin. Schiano left Rutgers in 2012 to become head coach of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but his tenure lasted only two years. He has worked at Ohio State as a coordinator in recent years, but he was never a head coach after leaving the Bucs. Schiano seemed to be in line to get the top job at Tennessee in late 2017. The deal fell apart after widespread backlash that included a protest on campus and complaints on social media from fans, state lawmakers and gubernatorial candidates over whether Schiano might have been aware of Jerry Sandusky's sexual abuse of children at Penn State when he was an assistant coach. Schiano said he had no knowledge of what was happening at the time. ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/APTop25CollegeFootballPoll and            https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and            https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"DeVos calls for making financial aid unit a separate agency  Link to Image Education Secretary Betsy DeVos says Congress should consider splitting her department's financial aid operation into a separate federal agency with the flexibility to operate like a private bank. DeVos made the comments Tuesday in Reno, Nevada, at an annual conference hosted by the Education Department's Federal Student Aid division, which oversees and manages nearly $1.6 trillion in federal student loans. Speaking to financial aid professionals, DeVos said the student lending division has become an ""untamed beast"" after years of tinkering by Congress, and that it needs to become a ""world-class financial firm."" ""One has to wonder: Why isn't FSA a standalone government corporation, run by a professional, expert, and apolitical board of governors?"" DeVos said during her remarks. She went on to describe an agency that would report to Congress while remaining ""truly independent from interference, political or otherwise."" She said it would ""partner"" with schools to provide student grants and loans. Any proposal to spin off lending operations would require approval from Congress. Her plan did not come with any legislation, but instead she called on members of Congress to discuss her proposal. The proposal was met with skepticism by some in Congress, including Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor. ""The Federal Student Aid office should already be putting students at the center of its work and should already be free from political whims,"" Scott said. ""The department should focus its time and resources on implementing the existing student loan programs in good faith. There's nothing that could be done with a new agency that can't be done today."" In her remarks, DeVos said a separate FSA ""would do all the things it's been charged to do - only far better."" She has long argued that the government plays an outsized role in student lending, often describing it as a ""government monopoly"" that has become costly to taxpayers and students alike. She has criticized the Obama administration for taking over federal loans that were previously provided by private banks, saying it fueled higher levels of borrowing and gave schools incentive to raise tuition rates. At the same time, DeVos says Congress has created a confusing web of programs that students struggle to navigate as they borrow loans, pay them back or pursue programs that provide debt forgiveness. ""Just look at today's parade of repayment options, forgiveness plans, unlimited lending, and complex rules,"" she said Tuesday. ""Is it any wonder students are having bad experiences?"" DeVos is proposing a radical shift in strategy at the same time that Democrats in Congress are ramping up scrutiny of her handling of multiple federal loan programs. The House's education committee has threatened to subpoena DeVos to determine why her agency has stopped processing loan forgiveness claims from students who say they were defrauded by their schools. She faces similar scrutiny amid findings that the Education Department has rejected the vast majority of applications for the federal government's Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. DeVos denies wrongdoing and blames Congress for creating programs with overly complex rules. She revived that criticism Tuesday before calling on Congress to cooperate with her proposal. ""President Trump and this administration are committed to transforming Federal Student Aid for students,"" DeVos said. ""Congress needs to come alongside us to make this happen.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Top Georgetown players Akinjo, LeBlanc off basketball team  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - Two of Georgetown's top players - James Akinjo and Josh LeBlanc - will not play for the basketball team for the rest of the season. Coach Patrick Ewing announced Monday the sophomores are off the roster ""effective immediately."" The written statement did not say why they are gone from the Hoyas, who are off to a 4-3 start. Without offering specifics on what led to either player's departure, a university spokesperson issued another statement hours later, saying: ""Georgetown takes student conduct issues very seriously and ensures that they are investigated thoroughly. While we are not able to comment on specific cases, we have processes for investigating and adjudicating alleged violations of our student code that are fair to both parties."" The nature of Akinjo's situation is still unclear, but court records reveal a restraining order was issued in November against LeBlanc and players Myron Gardner and Galen Alexander. The documents show a female Georgetown student has accused LeBlanc of ""threats against my personal safety."" Two police incident reports referenced don't mention LeBlanc or the other players by name but detail two September incidents centering on the same property in northwest Washington. In one, the plaintiff charges one of the suspects with ""showing her his erect clothed penis."" A week later on Sept 16, three male suspects entered the property and took several items, including a camera and camera lens and two PlayStation controllers, according to one report. When subsequently contacted by video call, the suspect allegedly said to the victim, ""If you tell anyone, we'll send people after you."" A third university statement Tuesday specifically notes that Akinjo's is a separate case and the ongoing legal investigation does not involve him. Akinjo, the starting point guard, and LeBlanc, a front-court reserve, are among the top five scorers this season. They were a key part of a group the third-year coach hoped would help lead the school back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since the 2014-15 season under John Thompson III. Akinjo was the 2018-19 freshman of the year in the Big East Conference, averaging 13.4 points and 5.2 assists, while making 39.1% of his 3-point attempts. He started 32 of 33 games and appeared in all of them. Ewing said before this season he considered Akinjo and another sophomore, Mac McClung, one of the best backcourts in the country. Akinjo was averaging 13.4 points and 4.4 assists this season for Georgetown, which has lost two straight games heading into a road trip - Oklahoma State on Wednesday and SMU on Saturday. LeBlanc was averaging 7.2 points and 2.7 rebounds this season. He appeared in only six games because he was suspended for the team's opener. As a freshman, LeBlanc started the last 22 games and averaged 9.1 points and 7.3 rebounds, earning a spot on the Big East all-freshman team. Georgetown opened this season 4-1, including an 82-66 victory over then-No. 22 Texas at Madison Square Garden. But Ewing's team then lost 81-73 to then-No. 1 Duke in New York and 65-61 at home against UNC Greensboro last Saturday. Georgetown won the 1984 national championship with Ewing at center.

"Townshend regrets not staying to mourn after Who stampede  Link to Image Link to Image NEW YORK (AP) - Forty years after a stampede left 11 people dead and 23 injured at a Who concert in Cincinnati, Pete Townshend says he's always regretted not sticking around to deal with the aftermath. Instead, the band left the Riverfront Coliseum on December 3, 1979, and moved on to Buffalo, New York, the next stop on their tour. ""I'm not forgiving us. We should have stayed,"" Townshend told The Associated Press during a recent interview where he was promoting his debut novel, ""The Age of Anxiety."" The tragedy occurred as fans surrounded the arena hoping to claim a seat near the stage. Thousands had waited hours to get inside, ready to charge in for first-come seating. The band didn't find out about the calamity until the end of the show. Townshend recalls the band's manager, Bill Curbishley, telling him: ""I've got something terrible to tell you."" Townshend then described the shock of seeing bodies sprawled on the ground as they left the stadium - ""many of whom weren't dead, by the way,"" he said. ""They didn't know who was dead and who was just badly hurt, maybe 40 bodies under blankets."" Townshend remembered the rage he felt toward Curbishley for not telling the band about the tragedy before the show, admitting that he ""wanted to kill him."" ""You could at least give (us) a choice as to whether or not to go on,"" Townshend said. ""But the choice none of us made, which was equally dim, was that we left the building. You know, we should have stayed."" Curbishley declined comment when contacted by The Associated Press. However, in an interview with WCPO of Cincinnati, he said he fought with emergency officials and insisted the concert go on so there wouldn't be more disruption, and believes it likely saved lives. ""I said, 'If you stop them, you're going to have more problems on the arena floor. You could have more people hurt for sure, and if they came back through this area, the medical teams are never going to be able to cope with what they're doing,'"" he told WCPO. ""And if keeping my band on stage saves even one life, to me, that's what it's about.'"" Lead singer Roger Daltrey visited a memorial site at a high school near Cincinnati in 2018, but the entire band has not been back. That will change: Townshend said they plan return to the for the first time: An announcement is planned for later Tuesday. Townshend says he can't help thinking about those parents who lost their children, ""It isn't all about rock 'n' roll. This is about kids from Cincinnati who died - kids from Cincinnati whose parents went through trauma; kids from Cincinnati who were disabled or hurt or damaged by what happened there,"" Townshend said. A similar tragedy occurred in 2000 at the Roskilde Music Festival in Denmark. After Pearl Jam took the stage, there was a stampede that killed nine people and injured 28. Townshend says he called the band's frontman Eddie Vedder and told him to stay there. ""Don't leave. I don't care whether you've got another festival tomorrow for a million euros. Stay there.' And they stayed there for three days. And I think it really helped,"" Townshend said. Townshend feels that enough time has passed for meaningful discussion about the Cincinnati tragedy. ""How are we responsible? ... Now, we can have a conversation about it when we go back. That conversation will pick up. We will meet people and we'll be there. We'll be there. That's what's important. I'm so glad that we've got this opportunity to go back,"" he said. ""But I do think one of the things that happened at the time was that we ran away.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Boeing delays crew capsule test flight to space station  Link to Image Link to Image CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - Boeing has delayed its first test flight of its Starliner crew capsule to the International Space Station. The launch is now targeted for Dec. 19. NASA said Tuesday that the two-day postponement was caused by problems with ground equipment at the Cape Canaveral pad. Both the Starliner and United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket are healthy, officials said. It will be the first trip to space by a Starliner. No astronauts will be aboard. Instead, a mannequin loaded with sensors and named Rosie - after World War II's Rosie the Riveter - will occupy the commander's seat. SpaceX conducted a similar test flight of its Dragon crew capsule in March. The two companies expect to start launching astronauts to the space station for NASA next year. It will be the first time since the end of NASA's space shuttle program in 2011 that U.S. astronauts rocket into orbit from home soil. NASA astronauts have been riding Russian rockets to the space station, for tens of millions of dollars per seat, while awaiting the repeatedly delayed commercial crew vehicles. SpaceX's crew Dragon is a much enhanced version of its cargo Dragon, which has been delivering supplies to the space station since 2012.

"William Barr is said to doubt report backing FBI in 2016 Russia inquiry  Link to Image WASHINGTON - Attorney General William Barr has told Justice Department officials that he is skeptical of a conclusion by the department's inspector general that the FBI had sufficient information to open the investigation into whether any Trump associates conspired with Russia during the 2016 presidential race, according to two people familiar with the conversations. Should Barr rebut the inspector general's assessment, due out next week in a highly anticipated report, President Trump's allies will most likely use that pushback to dismiss the work itself. The review is expected to contradict some of the unfounded theories about the 2016 election that the president and his allies have promoted. FULL TEXT Barr's doubts are significant because they could be perceived as the nation's top law enforcement officer siding with Trump, who has long cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Russia investigation, over law enforcement officials. His views are sure to inflame critics of Barr, who have accused him of siding with the president over the rule of law in his handling of the special counsel's findings and in a recent speech in which he defended Trump's use of executive authority. While it is a part of the executive branch, the Justice Department has typically sought to maintain some independence from the White House to guarantee that justice is applied fairly and not wielded as a political cudgel. Barr's skepticism could place more pressure on John H. Durham - the federal prosecutor who is conducting a separate criminal inquiry into the roots of the Russia investigation - to find evidence backing Barr's position. Durham has already unearthed some evidence that supports Barr's uncertainty of the inspector general's findings, according to a lawyer involved in the Durham inquiry. The attorney general has also expressed skepticism at the FBI's decision to investigate Trump's own ties to Russia and whether he obstructed justice. It is unclear whether the report by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, will address that. Barr has privately praised Horowitz for his work and has not made it clear whether he will publicly disagree with the report. It is standard practice for the Justice Department to submit to the inspector general a written response to his findings, which is then included in the final assessment. Barr could use that opportunity to issue a formal rebuttal, or he could make a public statement of some other kind. ""The inspector general's investigation is a credit to the Department of Justice,"" the department's spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said in a statement Monday night. ""Rather than speculating, people should read the report for themselves next week, watch the inspector general's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and draw their own conclusions about these important matters."" A spokeswoman for Horowitz declined to comment. The Washington Post first reported the dispute. It was not clear what Barr based his uncertainty on. The threshold to open the Russia investigation was not particularly high. The FBI can open a preliminary inquiry based on ""information or an allegation"" that a crime or threat to national security may have occurred or will occur, according to bureau policy. Typically, agents open counterintelligence investigations with a small amount of evidence, Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer who has also been a target of Trump's ire, testified privately to congressional investigators last year. The conclusion that the FBI had enough evidence when it opened the Russia investigation will be part of the long-anticipated report that wraps up Horowitz's nearly two-year inquiry into aspects of the case, including its origins and whether the FBI abused its surveillance powers when it sought a wiretap of a former Trump campaign adviser. While Horowitz is expected to sharply criticize the FBI's top leaders, he is not expected to find that any of the bureau's officials acted out of political bias against Trump when they decided to investigate links between his associates and Russia. Ultimately, Horowitz concluded that the FBI violated no rules when it began its delicate inquiry, work that not only thrust the bureau into a politically treacherous position but has also overshadowed much of Trump's presidency. Horowitz's ""excellent work has uncovered significant information that the American people will soon be able to read for themselves,"" Kupec said in her statement. As Horowitz worked on his review, senior Justice Department officials have also discussed putting in place procedures and guidelines that would force the bureau to get Justice Department approval before opening an investigation on someone like the president, one person who has been briefed on those conversations said. Horowitz also found that a low-level lawyer at the FBI, Kevin Clinesmith, altered a document to include false information, and then included it in a packet of information that the FBI used to renew a warrant to secretly wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser.

"Iconic Southern rock recording studio is revived in Georgia  Link to Image Link to Image ATLANTA (AP) - The Georgia music studio that fused blues, country and other sounds into Southern rock is being reborn. Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon helped propel the Allman Brothers Band and other groups to stardom in the 1970s. Capricorn's historic Studio A is reopening this week, after years of work by Mercer University and other supporters to restore and equip it with state-of-the-art technology. ""It's a place that spawned a decade of remarkable creative activity,"" Mercer President William Underwood said in an interview. It also helped make Macon one of the nation's music capitals. Underwood hopes the renovated studio will help preserve Macon's place among cities that forged the music history of the United States - places like Nashville and Memphis in Tennessee, Muscle Shoals in Alabama and Detroit, Chicago and New Orleans. Macon's civic leaders view Southern rock through a far different lens these days than in the 1970s. Southern rockers and Southern Baptists traveled in different orbits back then. The Capricorn music scene - part of the drug-infused counterculture movement of the time - was not always welcome in conservative Middle Georgia. Now, Capricorn and Southern rock are officially sanctioned by today's leaders, many of whom were fans in their younger days. Underwood, for instance, grew up listening to Southern rock and considers The Allman Brothers Band ""the greatest jam band ever."" In planning the new music complex, Underwood and others visited music hubs including Nashville, where Elvis Presley and others recorded their hits in RCA's Studio B. ""There are people all over the world who travel to see these restored studios,"" said Larry Brumley, a senior vice president at Mercer. Macon-area officials hope the restoration - funded with help from two charitable foundations and other private donors - will help spur downtown redevelopment. The restored Macon studio is part of Mercer Music at Capricorn, a 20,000-square-foot (1,860-square-meter) complex that will include a museum. Among its goals: To train and inspire new musicians. To that end, the Capricorn Music Incubator will provide 12 rehearsal rooms for musicians to hone their craft. The idea is ""to be a place to bring talented, creative people together and have them interact and engage with one another,"" Underwood said. ""One day hopefully the next Otis Redding will come out of that incubator,"" he said. Redding's voice became emblematic of Macon music six decades ago, after Mercer University student Phil Walden discovered his vocal talents while booking local bands for fraternity parties. In 1969, Capricorn Records was formed by Walden and others, including Frank Fenton and producer Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records. ""My father loved the South, he loved Georgia and he especially loved Macon,"" Phil Walden's daughter, Amantha, said at Tuesday's dedication ceremony. ""He loved Southern music deep inside his soul."" ""My father's life mission was to show the world what the South was capable of, and today we are here to celebrate a chapter of that mission,"" she added. Walden, his brother Alan Walden and their business partners discovered new artists who went on to create what became Southern rock. The Charlie Daniels Band, the Marshall Tucker Band, Elvin Bishop, Wet Willie and others recorded songs inside the studio that was built for the Capricorn record label. The Allman Brothers Band became so popular that they helped a former Georgia governor named Jimmy Carter win the 1976 presidential election by performing at campaign events, Carter has said. Carter told Mercer graduates at their 2016 commencement that he might not have been elected if the band hadn't ""adopted"" him. ""Gregg Allman was better known than I was at that time,"" Carter said in 2017. ""The band got the campaign political attention and raised much needed funds."" When Underwood became Mercer's president, the vacant offices that once housed Capricorn were a shambles, with one exception. ""The studio itself - that magical place where this great music was made - was still intact,"" Underwood recalled. ""It was kind of a miracle."" A second venue, Studio B, will be used for larger-scale recordings and to host concerts and other special events. Film scores could be recorded there, tying into Georgia's booming movie industry, Underwood said. The studio will also feature a custom-built, 40-channel analog sound board that was created by the Maryland-based company API, he said. Wes Griffith, who now manages the newly restored studio, recalls the first time he stepped inside. ""I was in awe, standing there where all these great things happened, all this great music was made,"" Griffith said. ""It's just a dream come true for me to be the steward of that place and share that history and start a new beginning.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Carolina Panthers fire head coach Ron Rivera  Link to Image CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - The Ron Rivera era has come to an abrupt end in Carolina. The Panthers fired their all-time winningest head coach with the team on a four-game losing streak and headed to its third non-playoff season in four years. ""I believe this is the best decision for the long-term success of our team,"" Panthers owner David Tepper said in a statement Tuesday. ""I have a great deal of respect for Ron and the contributions he has made to this franchise and to this community."" Secondary coach Perry Fewell was been named interim head coach. Offensive coordinator Norv Turner will transition to special assistant to the head coach, and quarterbacks coach Scott Turner will serve as offensive coordinator. Tepper said he will begin a search for a new coach immediately. Rivera was hired in 2011 and was 76-63-1 in the regular season and a 3-4 postseason mark. In nine seasons Rivera guided the team to a Super Bowl appearance, an NFC championship and three NFC South titles. But the Panthers have fallen on hard times lately following injuries to quarterback Cam Newton the past two seasons. The Panthers are 5-7 this season and are all but eliminated from playoff contention after a 29-21 loss to the Washington Redskins on Sunday at home. When asked if he was worried about his future with the team on Sunday after his team surrendered a 14-0 lead to the Redskins, Rivera replied, ""I'm not worried about my future. I'm worried about this football team. We have a game coming up on Sunday"" at Atlanta. They started this season 5-3. Last year the team was 6-2 but lost seven straight games and finished 7-9. Since losing to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50 four seasons ago, the Panthers are 29-31 and have not won a playoff game. Rivera, 57, did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment from The Associated Press. Rivera's firing might not be the only change coming. Tepper, who bought the team in 2018, said long-term mediocrity is not an option for the Panthers. ""We are going to take a comprehensive and thorough review of our football operation to make sure we are structured for long-term sustained success,"" Tepper said. ""Our vision is to find the right mix of old-school discipline and toughness with modern and innovative processes. We will consider a wide range of football executives to complement our current football staff."" Tepper said the team will hire an assistant general manager and vice president of football operations. ""We all must recognize that this is the first step in a process, but we are committed to building and maintaining a championship culture for our team and our fans,"" Tepper said. Rivera was extremely well liked in the Panthers locker room, and he easily related to players having played nine seasons in the NFL for the Chicago Bears, winning a Super Bowl with Jim McMahon, Walter Payton and others in 1985. Rivera is a two-time NFL Coach of the Year and likely won't have a problem landing a job next season. As for what the move means for Newton remains to be seen given that Tepper has shown he's not afraid to make big changes. The legacies of Rivera and Newton have always been intertwined as both came to the Panthers in 2011. Newton is coming off shoulder and foot injuries and the team could save $19 million under the salary cap if they release or trade him after the season. Kyle Allen has filled in for Newton this season at quarterback and is 5-5 as a starter. ___ More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and            https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Canadian fugitive in murder case arrested in California  Link to Image Link to Image OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) - A Canadian man considered one of British Columbia's most wanted fugitives in a 2008 killing has been arrested in California, authorities said. The Butte County Sheriff's Office said Brandon Teixeira, 28, was arrested Sunday in Oroville after he rammed his SUV into a sheriff's armored van while trying to escape. Two SWAT teams from other law enforcement departments and U.S. marshals helped arrest Teixeira, who was subdued by a police dog after exiting his vehicle, the office said. Teixeira was taken to a hospital and released and is in federal custody pending his extradition. It was not immediately clear if Teixeira had attorney who could speak on this behalf. Deputies said they found 26 pounds (12 kilograms) of heroin, over 1,000 painkiller pills, and an estimated 40 pounds (18 kilograms) of marijuana. They also arrested a New York man on charges of harboring and concealing a wanted felon, possession of heroin for sale, and possession of marijuana for sale. The sheriff's office said Teixeria was one of British Columbia's most wanted fugitives but gave no other details. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported Teixeira is facing a charge of first-degree murder in the 2017 shooting death of Nicolas Khabra, 28.

"The Latest: Wintry storm winding down in New England  Link to Image BOSTON (AP) - The Latest on the winter storm in the Northeast (all times local): 2:45 p.m. A widespread storm that brought heavy snowfall across the Northeast in recent days is winding down. The National Weather Service says the long-lasting storm is slowly moving out of the region Tuesday afternoon and should be in parts of Canada by nighttime. The storm arrived in parts of the region on Sunday. It dumped more than two feet in parts of upstate New York, western Massachusetts and Vermont, but less than six inches along the coast on Tuesday.

"House report to outline evidence for impeachment of President Trump  Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - The House is poised to release a landmark impeachment report outlining evidence of what it calls Donald Trump's wrongdoing toward Ukraine, findings that will push Congress toward a debate over whether the 45th president should be removed from office. Democrats on the Intelligence Committee are making the case that Trump engaged in behavior violating his oath of office and, in the course of their investigation, obstructed Congress by stonewalling the proceedings. Republicans are defending the president in a rebuttal claiming Trump never intended to pressure Ukraine when he asked for a ""favor"" - investigations of Democrats and Joe Biden. They say the military aid the White House was withholding was not being used as leverage, as Democrats claim, and besides the $400 million was ultimately released, although only after a congressional outcry. FULL TEXT Trump at the opening of a NATO leaders' meeting in London on Tuesday criticized the impeachment push as ""unpatriotic'' and ""a bad thing for our country.'' The findings being released Tuesday will lay the foundation for the House Judiciary Committee to assess potential articles of impeachment starting Wednesday, presenting a history-making test of political judgment with a case that is dividing Congress and the country. Trump said he will not watch the judiciary panel's hearing, saying it's ""all nonsense, they're just wasting their time."" Democrats once hoped to sway Republicans to consider Trump's removal, but they are now facing the prospect of an ever-hardening partisan split over the swift-moving proceedings on impeaching the president. The Intelligence Committee's is expected to vote on the report later Tuesday in a closed-door session. The findings are expected to forcefully make the Democrats' case that Trump engaged in what Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., calls impeachable ""wrongdoing and misconduct"" in pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden and Democrats while withholding military aid to the ally. For Republicans offering an early rebuttal ahead of the report's public release, the proceedings are simply a ""hoax,"" with Trump insisting he did nothing wrong and his GOP allies in line behind him. Trump tweeted his daily complaints about it all and then added a suggestive, if impractical, question: ""Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?"" Trump criticized the House for pushing forward with the proceedings while he was overseas, a breach of political decorum that traditionally leaves partisan differences at the water's edge. He predicted Republicans would actually benefit from the impeachment effort against him. For the Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi faces a critical moment of her leadership as she steers the process ahead after resisting the impeachment inquiry through the summer, warning at the time that it was too divisive for the country and required bipartisan support. Speaking to reporters at an international climate conference in Madrid, Pelosi declined to engage with impeachment questions. ""When we travel abroad, we don't talk about the president in a negative way,"" she said. ""We save that for home."" Possible grounds for impeachment are focused on whether Trump abused his office as he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to open investigations into Trump's political rivals. At the time, Trump was withholding $400 million in military aid, jeopardizing key support as Ukraine faces an aggressive Russia at its border. The report also is expected to include evidence the Democrats say suggests obstruction of Congress, based on Trump's instructions for his administration to defy subpoenas for documents and testimony. The next step comes when the Judiciary Committee gavels open its own hearing with legal experts to assess the findings and consider potential articles of impeachment ahead of a possible vote by the full House by Christmas. That would presumably send it to the Senate for a trial in January. The Democratic majority on the Intelligence Committee says its report, compiled after weeks of testimony from current and former diplomats and administration officials, will speak for itself in laying out the president's actions toward Ukraine. Republicans preempted the report's public release with their own 123-page rebuttal. In it, they claim there's no evidence Trump pressured Zelenskiy. Instead, they say Democrats just want to undo the 2016 election. Republicans dismiss witness testimony of a shadow diplomacy being run by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and they rely on the president's insistence that he was merely concerned about ""corruption"" in Ukraine - though the White House transcript of Trump's phone call with Zelenskiy never mentions the word. ""They are trying to impeach President Trump because some unelected bureaucrats chafed at an elected President's 'outside the beltway' approach to diplomacy,"" according to the report from Republican Reps. Devin Nunes of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Michael McCaul of Texas. Schiff said the GOP response was intended for an audience of one, Trump, whose actions are ""outside the law and Constitution."" Democrats could begin drafting articles of impeachment against the president in a matter of days, with voting in the Judiciary Committee next week. Republicans on the committee, led by Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, plan to use procedural moves to stall the process and portray the inquiry as unfair to the president. The White House declined an invitation to participate, with counsel Pat Cipollone denouncing the proceedings as a ""baseless and highly partisan inquiry"" in a letter to Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. Trump had previously suggested that he might be willing to offer written testimony under certain conditions, though aides suggested they did not anticipate Democrats would ever agree to them. Cipollone's letter of nonparticipation applied only to the Wednesday hearing, and he demanded more information from Democrats on how they intended to conduct further hearings before Trump would decide whether to participate. Nadler said Monday if the president really thought his call with Ukraine was ""perfect,"" as he repeatedly says, he would ""provide exculpatory information that refutes the overwhelming evidence of his abuse of power.'' House rules provide the president and his attorneys the right to cross-examine witnesses and review evidence before the committee, but little ability to bring forward witnesses of their own. ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FULL TEXT The World Food Program said it plans to more than double the number of people it helps to more than 4 million. More than 7 million people overall are in need. A UN expert on the right to food last week said Zimbabwe is on the brink of man-made starvation and the number of people needing help is ""shocking"" for a country not in conflict. With poor rains expected before the harvest in April, the scale of hunger will worsen, the World Food Program's executive director David Beasley said in a statement. Zimbabwe's crushing economic crisis, the worst in a decade, and a drought across southern Africa will complicate aid delivery as prices for basic items soar and food supplies are lower than normal, the UN said. Inflation is ""skyrocketing to over 490 percent,"" according to the UN expert, Hilal Elver. That's the second highest rate in the world after Venezuela. Zimbabwe's crisis includes high unemployment, cash and water shortages, and electricity outages of up to 19 hours a day.

"Arkansas may revoke retailers' inactive medical marijuana licenses  Link to Image LITTLE ROCK, Ark. - Arkansas may consider revoking medical marijuana licenses for dispensaries that aren't open by June, officials said. Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control officials, who regulate the state's budding cannabis industry, said they could begin taking action against inoperable dispensaries at the end of January, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. But a necessary rule is still being drafted and won't be ready by then. FULL TEXT Officials have said licenses may not be reissued when they are up for renewal in June. Scott Hardin, an ABC spokesman, said in an e-mail last week that the amendment legalizing medical marijuana did not include an operation date for dispensaries. ""Due to this, the pace at which these dispensaries are developed and open for business is totally at the discretion of owners,"" Hardin said. ""ABC Enforcement agents continually check in with owners, requesting status updates while offering support and a reminder that the company was licensed to serve patients. ABC will send a letter to each dispensary in early January explaining the process of renewing the license while also requesting an updated time frame for opening."" Marijuana commissioners have expressed frustration at how long it is taking the 32 dispensaries in the state to open since being licensed this year. Only 11 are operating. Voters approved an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution in 2016 to legalize medical marijuana. David Couch, the attorney who drafted and sponsored the amendment, said more dispensaries should be open by now. ""It's totally unreasonable,"" Couch added. ""I think a lot of these unopened facilities are managed by out-of-state entities who believe that it's not economically in their best interest to open a facility now, so they're just going to wait. I think that's wrong."" Attorney Alex Gray, who represents several dispensaries, said cannabis companies have been weighing patient count, product supply and locations of other dispensaries. ""From the outside looking in, people don't understand a lot of the facts that go into a business,"" Gray said. ""There may be frustration that not enough dispensaries are open.

"A teacher told the child of a gay couple that homosexuality is wrong. She's been fired  It was a few days before Thanksgiving, and the fifth-grade students were sharing what they were thankful for this year. When one of the students replied that he was grateful he was finally being adopted by his two dads, the substitute teacher interjected. FULL TEXT ''Why on earth would you be happy about that?'' she asked, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Then, as the Utah elementary school class looked on, she launched into a 10-minute lecture about the sins of homosexuality. She refused to stop until three girls summoned the principal. The unidentified teacher has now been fired over her words, which were detailed in a video shared on social media by one of the boy's fathers, ''Dancing With the Stars'' alumnus Louis van Amstel. The staffing company that employed her said in an emailed statement that it had ''made the decision to end the employee's relationship with Kelly Services'' after conducting an investigation. The story received widespread attention. In a video uploaded to Instagram on Monday, van Amstel said he had been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support, adding, ''Josh and I and our son, we did not expect how many reactions we would get.'' An Amsterdam-born former dance coach on ''Dancing With the Stars'' who now serves as a judge in a Netherlands version of the show, van Amstel and his husband have lived in Utah for about three years, running a fitness program in Salt Lake City. They started the adoption process about a year ago, met their son, age 11, earlier this year, and expect it to be finalized later this month. Van Amstel told The Washington Post that his family had felt welcome in their community. ''Not once have I been treated like how this woman treated us,'' he said. The incident happened Nov. 21 at the public school in Cedar Hills, part of the Alpine School District. Students, responding to a question from the substitute teacher, said they were thankful for turkey, their pets, and not having to go to school during the holidays, the Tribune reported. But when the boy gave thanks for his adoptive fathers, the teacher told him it was ''nothing to be grateful for'' and lectured the class about how ''homosexuality is wrong.'' The three girls went to the principal's office after trying - unsuccessfully - to get the teacher to stop. The school acted quickly, van Amstel said. The teacher was escorted out of the school, defending her comments and blaming the boy along the way. An Alpine School District spokesman told the Tribune that the district has a strict nondiscrimination policy and that ''appropriate action'' had been taken. Van Amstel said his son initially didn't want to tell his parents what happened, fearing it might jeopardize his adoption. He had come close to being adopted previously, only for it to fall through. Instead, van Amstel said, he cried when he heard the boy's response to the teacher's question.

"Domingo's accusers slam claims he never acted badly to women  Link to Image Link to Image SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Two opera singers who accused Placido Domingo of sexual misconduct said Tuesday that it was disappointing and disturbing that the opera legend recently claimed he has always behaved like a gentleman and never acted improperly toward women. Angela Turner Wilson and Patricia Wulf were among more than 20 women who accused Domingo of sexual harassment or inappropriate sexually charged behavior in two Associated Press reports this summer. Their new statement came in response to comments Domingo made in two recent interviews with European publications, in which he disputed the allegations against him and said he never abused his power. He said he always behaved like a gentleman but that ""gallant gestures are viewed differently nowadays."" ""There is nothing 'chivalrous' or 'gallant' about groping a woman in the workplace, in any country or era,"" Wilson and Wulf said in the statement issued through their attorney, Debra Katz. The Grammy Award-winning singer is one of the most celebrated and powerful men in the opera world and regarded as one of the greatest opera singers of all time. The long-married, Spanish-born star also is a prolific conductor and longtime administrator, having served as the general director of both the Los Angeles Opera and Washington Opera. Until recently, the 78-year-old had not spoken publicly about the allegations and had limited his reaction to statements from his lawyer and publicist. He had called the accusations ""in many ways, simply incorrect."" Last week, Domingo gave an interview to Spanish online newspaper El Confidencial in which he again stopped short of flatly denying the women's allegations but insisted he had never behaved improperly. He added that Spaniards are by nature ""warm, affectionate and loving. ""I have been gallant but always within the limits of gentlemanliness, respect and sensitivity,"" he said. Domingo also spoke to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, denying he abused his power and saying casting decisions were not made by him but by ""a team of four or five people."" He said that ""very offensive things were said about me as a human being."" Domingo's statements and ""continued failure to take responsibility for wrongdoing or to express any remorse is extremely disappointing and deeply disturbing,"" Turner and Wulf's statement said. ""He did not behave like a gentleman when he repeatedly propositioned women for sex in the workplace ... and when he groped them and kissed them over their objections,"" the statement said. ""He did not behave respectfully when he offered to assist with the careers of aspiring female opera singers if they came to his apartment and had sex with him."" The most serious allegation lodged against Domingo came from Turner, a soprano, who told the AP that he forcefully grabbed her breast in a makeup room at the Washington Opera in 1999 after she rejected his advances for weeks. Wulf, a mezzo soprano, said Domingo persistently propositioned and harassed her during performances at the Washington Opera in 1998, when he was general director. Another singer said when she worked with Domingo at the Los Angeles Opera in the mid-2000s, he stuck his hand down her skirt after asking her to sing for him at his apartment. Others said he forced wet kisses on their lips. U.S. opera houses canceled Domingo's upcoming performances following the accusations, and he resigned from the LA Opera, where he had been general director since 2003. It's investigating the allegations. European theaters have supported Domingo and maintained his appearances. ""It is deeply upsetting and unfair that Mr. Domingo can retreat to another world without having to come to terms with what he has done to many, many women here,"" Wulf said. The women's statement said Domingo's comments show an attempt to absolve his misconduct by blaming cultural differences and changing rules and standards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trump against the world: A snapshot of his trade disputes  Link to Image Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - There are lots of ways, it seems, to land on one of President Donald Trump's tariff hit lists. Countries can allegedly steal U.S. trade secrets. Or they can introduce a tax that the Trump administration doesn't like. Or they can be unlucky enough to find themselves in such dire economic straits that their currencies go into a freefall. Making good on his campaign pledge to upend decades of U.S. policy in favor of a pugnacious America-first approach, Trump has launched a series of protectionist broadsides against America's trading partners. He's also strived to replace a 25-year-old North American trade agreement with an updated version more to his liking. So far, though, he's been stymied by the U.S. Congress. Here's a look at some of the major items on Trump's trade agenda: ___ A TRADE WAR WITH CHINA For the past 17 months, the world's top two economies have been locked in the biggest global trade war since the 1930s. The Trump administration accuses Beijing of cheating in its quest to become the world's supreme leader in such cutting-edge industries as robotics and driverless cars. The administration, backed by many U.S. business groups, alleges that China steals technology, forces U.S. companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to its vast market and unfairly subsidizes China's tech companies while hogtying their foreign competitors in red tape. Trump has also railed against America's gaping trade deficit with China: $380 billion last year. The president has imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports and plans to tax an additional $160 billion in goods on Dec. 15 - a move that would extend his import taxes to just about everything China ships to the United States. Beijing has hit $120 billion in U.S. products with retaliatory tariffs. Thirteen rounds of negotiations have failed to achieve even a preliminary breakthrough. Beijing is reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that might satisfy the administration. In October, the two sides agreed to a modest deal that left the thorniest issues unresolved: Trump agreed not to proceed with plans to raise tariffs on some Chinese goods. Beijing agreed to buy large quantities of U.S. farm exports. But they have failed to finalize that so-called Phase 1 agreement. And on Tuesday, Trump warned that an agreement might not be reached until after the 2020 presidential election. ___ METALS MAYHEM Last year, Trump unsheathed a little-used weapon in U.S. trade policy - Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 - to declare foreign steel and aluminum a threat to America's national security. Using that justification, he imposed tariffs of 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% on aluminum. But he exempted several countries. Argentina and Brazil, for instance, avoided the tariffs by agreeing instead to accept quotas on their metal exports to the U.S. With one early-morning tweet Monday, Trump demolished that arrangement. He accused Argentina and Brazil of manipulating their currencies lower in order to give their exporters an unfair price advantage in foreign markets. It's true that Brazil's real and the Argentina's peso have plummeted against the U.S. dollar. But it's not because their governments have engaged in currency manipulation. Rather, it's because their economies are in crisis: Brazil is contending with double-digit unemployment and economic stagnation after two years of deep recession. Argentina is suffering from an economic crisis marked by runaway inflation, huge debts and widespread poverty. ___ NAFTA 2.0 Trump last year browbeat Mexico and Canada into agreeing to a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But his version - the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA - still awaits approval from the U.S. Congress. Having taken effect in 1994, the original NAFTA erased most trade barriers between the three economies and created a powerful regional trade bloc. Many U.S. manufacturers moved factories south of the border to capitalize on low-wage Mexican labor and ship products back to the United States, duty-free. Trump and other critics accused NAFTA of wiping out American manufacturing jobs. Trump warned that if he couldn't negotiate a better deal, he'd kill NAFTA altogether. USMCA emerged after more than a year of contentious negotiations. The revamped deal is meant to return some factories and factory jobs to the United States. Among other things, it requires that 40% to 45% of autos must be built where auto workers earn at least $16 an hour in order to qualify for the trade deal's duty-free status. But House Democrats, who must approve USMCA, insist that Trump's version needs to be tweaked to ensure that it can be enforced. They've been negotiating changes with Trump's top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, but have yet to resolve their differences. ___ FRANCE'S TECH TAX The administration on Monday announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 100% on cheese, wine, lipstick and other French imports, collectively worth $2.4 billion. The reason: France last summer passed a digital services tax that targets American tech giants such as Amazon and Google. The French tax is designed to prevent tech companies from dodging taxes by establishing their headquarters in low-tax European Union countries. It imposes a 3% annual levy on French revenue of digital companies with yearly global sales worth more than 750 million euros ($830 million) and French revenue exceeding 25 million euros. The Trump administration has also criticized the French tax for targeting companies' revenue, not their profits, and for being retroactive. French President Emmanuel Macron has threatened a robust ""response'' from Europe if the U.S. proceeds with the tariffs. ___ TAXING FOREIGN CARS At Trump's request, the Commerce Department launched an investigation into auto imports - and then dutifully declared that they, too, posed a threat to America's national security. That could clear the way for Trump to impose tariffs on foreign vehicles and auto parts. Auto tariffs would mark a major escalation in Trump's protectionist policies. The United States last year imported $192 billion worth of passenger vehicles and $159 billion in auto parts. Virtually no one outside the White House supports the tariffs. Imposing them would widen a rift with Europe and risk a backlash in Congress, where lawmakers are already considering scaling back the president's power to impose tariffs on national security grounds. Trump has sought to use the tariff threat to wring trade concessions out of Japan and the European Union. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said that Trump vowed to forgo tariffs on Japan's cars as part of a mini-trade deal the two countries reached earlier this year. In May, Trump delayed the tariffs for six months while continuing negotiations with Japan and the EU. As mid-November approached, Trump said he'd decide on the tariffs ""very soon.'' But the deadline came and went with no comment from the administration. ___ Follow Paul Wiseman on Twitter at @PaulWisemanAP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"School reforms fail to lift US on global test  The performance of American teenagers in reading and math has been stagnant since 2000, according to the latest results of a rigorous international exam, despite a decadeslong effort to raise standards and help students compete with peers across the globe. And the achievement gap in reading between high and low performers is widening. Although the top quarter of American students have improved their performance on the exam since 2012, the bottom 10th percentile lost ground, according to an analysis by the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal agency. FULL TEXT The disappointing results from the exam, the Program for International Student Assessment, were announced Tuesday and follow those from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, an American test that recently showed that two-thirds of children were not proficient readers. Overall, American 15-year-olds who took the PISA test scored slightly above students from peer nations in reading but below the middle of the pack in math. The top performers in reading were four provinces of China - Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Also outperforming the United States were Singapore, Macao, Hong Kong, Estonia, Canada, Finland, and Ireland. The United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia performed similarly to the United States. Among the countries that demonstrated improvement on the test were Portugal, Peru, and Colombia. There were some bright spots for the United States: Achievement gaps between native-born and immigrant students were smaller than such gaps in peer nations. Low-performing students have been the focus of decades of bipartisan education overhaul efforts, costing many billions of dollars, that have resulted in a string of national programs - No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, the Common Core State Standards, the Every Student Succeeds Act - but uneven results. There is no consensus on why the performance of struggling students is declining. Education experts argue vociferously about a range of potential causes, including school segregation, limited school choice, funding inequities, family poverty, too much focus on test prep, and a dearth of instruction in basic skills like phonics. About a fifth of American 15-year-olds scored so low on the PISA test that it appeared they had not mastered reading skills expected of a 10-year-old, according to Andreas Schleicher, director of education and skills at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which administers the exam. Those students, he said, face ""pretty grim prospects"" on the job market. Daniel Koretz, an expert on testing and a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said recent test results showed that ""it's really time to rethink the entire drift of policy reform because it just isn't working."" Because the United States lacks a centralized system for teacher training or distributing quality instructional materials to schools, Koretz said, states and districts did not always effectively carry out the Common Core or other initiatives. The Common Core, which began almost a decade ago, has been a national effort by governors, state education chiefs, philanthropists, and school reformers to enrich the American curriculum and help students compete with children around the world. Its priorities include increasing the amount of nonfiction reading, writing persuasive essays using evidence drawn from texts, and adding conceptual depth in math. The effort became a political lightning rod, with the left opposing a new generation of standardized tests tied to the Core, and the right seeing the effort as an unwelcome intrusion into local control of schools. Some states that initially signed on to the Core later rejected it. Even in those places that stuck with the effort, the curricular changes that flowed from the Common Core could be made without necessarily improving the quality of teaching, Koretz said. He suggested a renewed focus on classroom instruction, and on providing students and families who are poor, or are recent immigrants, with support like social workers and translators. The most recent PISA test was given in 2018 to 600,000 15-year-olds in 79 education systems around the world, and included both public and private school students. In the United States, a demographically representative sample of 4,800 students from 215 schools took the test, which is given every three years. Although math and science were also tested, about half of the questions were devoted to reading, the focus of the 2018 exam. Students were asked to determine when written evidence supported a particular claim and to distinguish between fact and opinion, among other tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gordon Hayward making progress but can't project a return date  Forward Gordon Hayward completed some contact drills against Celtics coaches Tuesday as he continues to move closer to his return after suffering a broken left hand last month. ""It's definitely sore, and I think that's something I've got to work through,"" Hayward said. ""I've got to work through that to make my hand stronger, and hopefully over the next couple of days I can do that and get it kind of more the same strength of my right hand. ""I think it's going to be a little while, and plus I was right-hand-dominant anyway. So it's definitely going to probably not be the exact same, but get it more strengthened so the percentage is closer to my right."" FULL TEXT Hayward suffered the injury when he collided with Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge in the Celtics' Nov. 9 win over San Antonio. He underwent surgery two days later and was initially ruled out for six weeks. Hayward said last weekend that he believed he was progressing ahead of schedule, but on Tuesday he acknowledged that he was uncertain about when he might return. He is eager to test the hand in less-scripted practice situations and anticipates dealing with some pain for most of this year. ""It's definitely something where, hopefully not the rest of the season, but certainly a lengthy part of the season, I'm going to have to continue to get treatment, continue to ice it and kind of manage some of the symptoms,"" Hayward said. ""I don't want it to get hit again, but I'm sure it will get hit again, and when that happens, it'll be sore. So I'll manage that."" Hayward said he will look into wearing some kind of pad or wrap on the hand when he comes back, but he generally prefers not to because it can affect his play. He is grateful that he has been able to maintain his conditioning, however. ""It's been great,"" he said. ""This injury is nothing compared to the last one. Any time you just injure something in your upper body, at least you can be doing legs and moving around. Jumping, that's huge, in my opinion."" Garnett on Irving Former Celtics star Kevin Garnett said Tuesday that he is not surprised that Kyrie Irving left Boston to sign with the Nets, because he doesn't have the mental makeup needed to thrive in the city. ""Boston's a tough town, dog,"" Garnett told reporters in New York while promoting ""Uncut Gems,"" his new film starring Adam Sandler. ""You got to want that. The people want it for you. That's why Paul [Pierce] is perfect for it. Paul wants the shot every time. Like, 'You're 0 for 14.' And he's like, 'I know, but they want it.' "" In October 2018, Irving told a large group of Celtics season ticket-holders that he intended to re-sign with Boston at season's end. But then the season went sour, and just over one month after the Celtics were defeated by the Bucks in five games in the conference semifinals, Irving agreed to a four-year deal with the Nets. He missed Brooklyn's two games against the Celtics last week because he is sidelined with a shoulder injury, but when the Nets came to Boston last Wednesday, the night was filled with anti-Irving chants anyway. Smart is hurting Guard Marcus Smart missed Tuesday's practice because of an illness and a sore oblique, and  coach Brad Stevens said he will be listed as doubtful for Wednesday's game against the Heat. Smart injured his oblique when he tried to take a charge on Knicks forward Kevin Knox during the win over New York Sunday. He was helped off the court and did not return. A left oblique injury forced Smart to miss the first round of last year's playoffs, too. He has been dealing with plenty of bumps and bruises this year. Stevens was asked whether the team might consider sitting him out for a stretch to regroup. ""We're open to that with any of the guys,"" Stevens said. ""We've talked to them about it. And if our training staff thinks there's something that is really nagging a guy, then they will certainly suggest it. ""This is a decision that will be based on if he can get over being sick, which he was pretty under the weather today. And then the oblique, which is obviously, with his past, we're just alert to. ""Sounds like it's just like a contusion, so that's good, but that doesn't mean it's not super sore. And if it's super sore, he's not going to play."" Langford update Stevens said that rookie Romeo Langford's most recent ankle injury, suffered in the Maine Red Claws' win Sunday, does not appear to be as serious as initially feared. Langford has remained in Maine and will continue to practice there instead of returning to Boston to begin another round of rehabilitation.

"Chicago police blame Facebook for illegal gun, drug sales  Link to Image CHICAGO (AP) - Private Facebook groups have ""emboldened"" sellers of illegal drugs and guns to connect with potential buyers over the social media site, Chicago police said Tuesday, as leaders announced that a two-year undercover investigation led to more than 50 arrests. Police leaders, including Chicago's new interim superintendent, also accused Facebook of failing to help prevent illegal sales of guns. The social media company banned private sales, trades and exchanges of firearms in 2016, but investigators said they found dealers using private groups and messages to quickly sell firearms and drugs at prices higher than street values. First Deputy Superintendent Anthony Riccio said Facebook agreed to shut down groups identified during the Chicago investigation but that it also should kick members of those groups off the site. ""Facebook often cites privacy concerns when they are confronted with the facts of our investigation,"" Riccio said. ""The truth is, Facebook is harboring criminals. These criminals know how to use the privacy Facebook affords them and they profit from the sales of illegal drugs and dangerous guns."" Riccio also said police have been frustrated by Facebook's removal of fake profiles that investigators use to pose as potential buyers. Facebook spokeswoman Sarah Pollack said the company quickly responds to ""valid legal"" requests from police. ""Illicit drug and firearms sales have no place on our platform,"" Pollack said. ""We remove content and accounts that violate our policy and catch over 97% of drug sale content and over 93% of the firearms sales content we remove before it is reported to us."" The company's instructions for law enforcement say a subpoena is required to share a subscriber's records including name, email addresses and location information on recent log-ins; disclosing contents of an account requires a federal or state search warrant. The site also says all Facebook users must use ""the name they go by in everyday life,"" and fake accounts will be penalized. Facebook says it uses detection technology to find content that violates its policies banning the sale of drugs or firearms, including posts in private groups. Chicago police leaders have blasted Facebook after previous investigations of illegal guns and drug sales on the site. In 2017, then-Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the company was failing to cooperate with police cracking down on the activity. Tension over law enforcement's use of social media networks exists in other areas too; for example, police in Memphis were sued by the state's branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in 2018 for using an undercover Facebook account to monitor protest groups' activities. Personal privacy advocates say Facebook could do more to protect users from that type of police activity and keep meeting its baseline responsibility to hold law enforcement to the same rules as everyone else on the platform. ""Police shouldn't get to follow different rules than members of the public,"" said Dave Maass, a researcher for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""They may say 'Oh, this is to cut down on gun sales.' The next thing you know, you're searching social media for information on First Amendment activities or whether they've been driving while texting."" Charlie Beck, Chicago's interim police superintendent and the former head of the Los Angeles Police Department, said Tuesday that Facebook users' privacy rights don't ""trump the rights of the general public."" ""Another person's rights have to stop where the safety of another individual becomes in jeopardy,"" Beck said. ""That's what laws are all about.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"'Unicorn puppy' finds his forever home - he'll stay with his Missouri rescue mission  Link to Image CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (AP) - A dog who was dubbed the unicorn puppy because of a tail-like growth between his eyes will remain with the founder of a Missouri rescue group, despite more than 300 offers to adopt him. FULL TEXT The beagle-mix puppy, named Narwhal the Little Magical Furry Unicorn, was rescued in November by Mac's Mission in southeast Missouri. He drew international attention when his picture hit social media, prompting all the adoption offers but also some negative attention, including death threats, said Rochelle Steffen, founder of the Mac's Mission in Jackson. Those two factors - plus the dog's winning personality - convinced Steffen to reverse an earlier decision to find a new home for Narwhal, she told The Southeast Missourian. She said her tiny rescue could not properly vet the 300 adoption applicants and she was concerned by ""stupid, ugly comments (online) about this sweet little puppy."" People have shown up at the rescue in Jackson because of the dog, prompting security measures and meetings ""by appointment only,"" Steffen said. Narwhal is watched at all times by Steffen and trusted volunteers. Steffen said she wanted to keep the dog safe and was concerned he could be exploited by someone without his best interests at heart. ""If somebody is going to make money off of him, I would love to see it go toward the rescue, and save thousands more dogs,"" Steffen said. People have made ""giant"" offers to buy him, Steffen said. ""But he's not for sale."" And the dog's cute personality made it difficult to consider giving him to someone else, she said. ""It's not just a decision from me,"" she said. ""The whole rescue cannot fathom him leaving. We all fell in love with him."" Mac's Mission is currently involved in a court case involving the sale of a previously adopted dog, which taught Steffen that the organization loses control over an animal's fate once it is adopted. And the mission's former treasurer, Elizabeth Hann, is awaiting trial on charges that she stole $120,000 from the organization, which specializes in caring for animals with special needs. ""We have had a rough couple of years here,"" Steffen said of Mac's Mission. ""Lots of loss, lots of hurt."" And Mac, the mission's current ""spokesdog"", turns 9 in January. Steffen said she wasn't sure what was going to happen until Narwhal came along, saying he is ""absolutely, exactly what we needed."" She said the dog will be a spokesdog for a ""Different is awesome"" campaign and the long-term plan is to train him as a therapy dog. For now, Steffen is concentrating on letting him grow, and getting him fully vaccinated and socialized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Trump resists wading into British politics - except to say Boris Johnson 'will do a good job' if elected  Link to Image LONDON - President Trump, viewed by many here as an American bull in the proverbial china shop, was especially diplomatic on Tuesday, as he promised to ''stay out'' of British politics, just 10 days before a general election. But he couldn't quite help himself. FULL TEXT Trump declared that his ally Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ''very capable and I think he'll do a good job'' if elected on Dec. 12. As for Johnson's opponent, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, the president on Tuesday said, ''I can work with anybody.'' A month ago, in a call-in to Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage's radio show, Trump warned Britain that Corbyn would be ''so bad for your country, so bad.'' Trump claimed, ''He'd take you in such a bad way.'' Sitting next to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders Tuesday morning, Trump turned a photo-op into a 50-minute impromptu news conference. Mostly, Trump spoke about NATO and his feelings about French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump slammed as ''very, very nasty'' and ''very disrespectful'' recent comments by his French counterpart about the diminished state of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance. In his side remarks Tuesday, Trump was asked if he thought that Britain's government-run National Health Service should be on the table in future US-UK trade deals. ''No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly,'' Trump said. ''I don't even know where that rumor started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn't want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.'' The rumor may have started with Trump and his ambassador to Britain, Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets. The ambassador told the BBC on June 2 that all areas of the British economy, including the NHS and food, would be ''on the table'' in any future trade talks. Trump echoed the point two days later. During a news conference in London on June 4, when asked whether the NHS would be involved in a possible trade deal with the United States, Trump said, ''When you're dealing on trade, everything is on the table - so NHS or anything else, and a lot more than that. Everything will be on the table, absolutely.'' Trump has since backtracked, possibly aware of what a hot-button issue this is in Britain. In his phone-in with Farage a month ago, Trump said, ''It's not for us to have anything to do with your health-care system.'' The British prime minister, in the closing days of an election he is forecast to win, has sought to keep Trump at arm's length. On Friday, Johnson tried to dissuade the American president from offering his opinions on domestic affairs. ''What we don't do traditionally as loving allies and friends, what we don't do traditionally, is get involved in each other's election campaigns,'' Johnson told LBC radio. Johnson on Tuesday stated that he could ''categorically rule out'' that ''any part of the NHS will be on the table in any trade negotiations,'' including Amercian pharmacueticals. The prime minister also called Corbyn's warning that Johnson and Trump had formed an alliance to sell out the NHS, as ''pure Loch Ness Monster, Bermuda Triangle stuff.'' Asked if Trump's support was a possible embarrassment, Johnson said, ''On the contrary, and I have good relations with Washington, the president, with President Macron, Chancellor Merkel, and that's vital for the UK. And we'll be having a series of meetings - bilateral, trilateral of all kinds - in the course of the next couple of days.'' Trump said he would be meeting with Johnson at 10 Downing Street later in the trip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On Monday night, Brady was asked about his talk during his weekly interview on Westwood One Sports radio with Jim Gray. FULL TEXT ""Well I do that quite a bit in practice,"" Brady explained. ""I know they don't always pick it up when I do speak, but I do speak a lot in meetings and [on] the practice field, and certainly in the huddle. I'm just trying to communicate what I see.

""[The Texans] came out and played really well, and they played very aggressively. When that happens, you've got to go out there and you've got to try to match it. They got off to a great start, and we tried to battle back and just came up short in the end."" Asked about how the team is reacting to the loss, Brady explained that the team needs to keep things in perspective. ""I don't think anyone's happy when we lose, except for the people that are rooting against us,"" Brady added. ""I'm sure there's quite a few of those. We've lost games in the past, I've lost games in the past, and as much as it hurts to lose, you have to keep it in perspective and realize the place we're at the in the season.

Related: Tom Brady defends recivers, won't blame flu for Texans loss It's from something that was once said by former U.S. President Richard Nixon. According to Nixon speechwriter Williams Safire - writing in his book, ""Before the Fall,"" published in 1975 - then-presidential candidate Nixon wrote down a note about Senator Ted Kennedy in 1968 following the death of Mary Jo Kopechne. It was the same quote Brady used. Nixon, famously a strong political opponent of Kennedy (having lost a close presidential election to his brother in 1960), broke with his usual stance to give the Massachusetts senator a ""pep talk"" following Chappaquiddick, according to Safire's account. This came before a press conference that included the two political rivals, from which Nixon's note was derived. Hayden Bird can be reached at hayden.bird@globe.com.

"Measles outbreak leads to shutdown of public services in Samoa  The government of Samoa is shutting down all public services for two days to fight a measles outbreak that has killed more than 55 people and infected thousands of others in the South Pacific island nation over the past two months. FULL TEXT Nearly 3,900 cases of measles have been reported in the country, whose population is just 200,000. Schools have been shuttered since the government declared the outbreak a national emergency last month. The shutdown, which will take place Thursday and Friday, comes amid a resurgence of measles in dozens of countries in recent years. Worldwide, more than 140,000 people died from measles last year, according to estimates released Tuesday by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. In Samoa, where vaccination rates are low, more than 150 new cases of infection were disclosed Monday alone. Most of the victims in the country, which is part of the same island chain as American Samoa, have been babies and children under 4. The Samoan government said this week that half of the 29,000 most vulnerable children - those age 6 months to 4 years - had yet to be vaccinated. As in numerous other countries, officials have struggled to stanch mistrust about vaccinations. In Samoa's case, health authorities said many people became wary when two babies died last year after being given vaccines that had been erroneously mixed with an expired muscle relaxant instead of water. Although the measles vaccination rate among infants in the country was as high as 90 percent in 2013, according to the World Health Organization, by last year it had plummeted to 31 percent. Vaccinations were made mandatory for everyone in Samoa last month. ""Our children and people will never become immune to any future epidemic unless we have almost 100 percent vaccination coverage,"" Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said during a visit to hospitals Monday. ""It's the only antidote."" Mobile clinics have reached remote villages and rural areas in recent weeks, and over 110,000 people in Samoa have been vaccinated since early October, according to government figures. The country's hospitals are ill equipped to handle the crisis: The World Health Organization and UNICEF estimate the country's main hospital needs at least 180 additional nurses to fight the measles outbreak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But then the year went sour, and just over one month after the Celtics were defeated by the Bucks in five games in the conference semifinals, Irving agreed to a four-year deal with the Nets. He missed Brooklyn's two games against the Celtics last week because he is sidelined with a shoulder injury, but when the Nets came to Boston last Wednesday, the night was filled with anti-Irving chants anyway.

"Fresh protests gather in Najaf, amid talks over new premier  BAGHDAD - Antigovernment protesters surrounded a key shrine in the southern city of Najaf on Tuesday, as Iraq's political leaders continued talks over selecting a new prime minister after weeks of widespread unrest. FULL TEXT Five rockets landed inside Ain al-Asad air base, a sprawling complex in Western Anbar that hosts US forces, without causing any casualties and little damage, said a statement from Iraq's security media cell on Tuesday evening. The statement gave no further details. President Barham Salih met with Iraq's main political blocs as a 15-day constitutional deadline to name the next prime minister nears, two Iraqi officials said. Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Madi announced his resignation on Friday. The Sairoon bloc, led by influential Shi'ite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, addressed Salih in a letter and said they gave protesters the right to support a premier of their choice. Tens of protesters gathered around the Hakim shrine in the southern holy city of Najaf, a police official said. The demonstrators demanded that Sadr help them enter and symbolically take control of the shrine. Sadr commands Saraya Salam, a powerful militia group. The protesters believe the shrine is a center for Iranian intelligence operations, the police official said. After hours of tense standoff, a few protesters and some elderly tribal sheikhs were permitted to enter the shrine and inspect it. Officials all requested anonymity in line with regulations. Najaf has been one of the flashpoints in the protest movement, after demonstrators torched the Iranian Consulate there last week. The Hakim shrine has been the focus of recent violence. Three protesters were killed and 24 wounded on Saturday as security forces used live rounds to disperse them from the site. The southern city is the seat of the country's Shi'ite religious authority. At least 400 people have died since the leaderless uprising shook Iraq on Oct. 1, with thousands of Iraqis taking to the streets in Baghdad and the predominantly Shi'ite southern Iraq decrying corruption, poor services, lack of jobs and calling for an end to the political system that was imposed after the 2003 US invasion. Security forces dispersed crowds with live fire, tear gas, and sound bombs last week in Nasiriyah and Najaf, leading to heavy casualties and drawing condemnation from Washington and the United Nations. In an address to the UN Security Council on Tuesday, top United Nations envoy to Iraq Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert deplored the continued use of live ammunition and ""nonlethal devices"" like tear gas that have caused ""horrific injuries or death."" She condemned what she said were ""unlawful arrests and detentions"" targeting anti-government demonstrators. The UN envoy also questioned the status of the government's earlier investigations into the use of live fire and other violence, noting that though arrest warrants had been issued, perpetrators had not been brought to account. Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs David Schenker called the killing of protesters in Nasiriyah ""shocking and abhorrent,"" in remarks to reporters late Monday. ""The Iraqi people are calling for genuine reform implemented by trustworthy leaders who will put Iraq's national interests first. Without that commitment to reform, it makes little difference who the prime minister is,"" he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"South Boston home where Whitey Bulger's victims were buried may be torn down  Link to Image The home that James ""Whitey"" Bulger called ""The Haunty"" may get torn down. The Boston Landmarks Commission recently received an application from owner Mark Little to demolish the residence at 799 East Third St. in South Boston ""to make way for a new 4-unit townhouse style development with 8 garaged parking spots."" FULL TEXT Located in City Point, one of Boston's hottest neighborhoods, the cozy-looking home has been advertised as a developer's dream in a prime location, complete with architectural plans and renderings to build anew. But what the real estate listings haven't said is that it once served as a secret burial ground for Whitey Bulger's gang. The previous asking price of of $3.5 million was lowered to $3,395,000, and the property is currently under agreement, according to            Redfin.com, To newcomers, it's just another piece of pricey real estate. But longtime Southie residents may be aware of the history of this address, and how it became part of Bulger's grisly lore. Back in the early 1980s, the cozy-looking two-story Cape belonged to the brother of Bulger associate Pat Nee, and it had an unfinished dirt-floor basement where three of Bulger's victims were buried. In his testimony during Bulger's racketeering trial, Kevin J. Weeks recounted that he saw Bulger kill Arthur ""Bucky"" Barrett, John McIntyre, and Deborah Hussey in the house. Their bodies remained buried in the basement until 1985, when the house was about to be sold. At that point, Weeks said, the bodies were exhumed and buried across the street from Florian Hall in Dorchester. Bulger was later sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for participating in those murders and eight others while operating his criminal enterprise. The 89-year-old died in prison last October after he was beaten to death. In 1983, Barrett, a bar owner and safecracker who was suspected of a Medford bank burglary, was lured to the South Boston home, chained to a chair, and interrogated for hours by Bulger. Bulger shot Barrett in the head and then took a nap while his associates buried him in the basement, according to testimony. McIntyre was killed after telling law enforcement about a IRA gun-running trip organized by Bulger's gang. Hussey, the 26-year-old daughter of Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi's girlfriend, was strangled by Bulger in early 1985. According to the most recent real estate listing for ""The Haunty,"" the property consists of two attached houses with parking for six cars and a large backyard. It's been marketed as a development opportunity. ""Architectural plans have been approved for 9,766 sq ft sellable building area in PRIME SOUTHIE location between O & P Streets,"" the listing states. ""Full set of ZBA approved 4-unit architectural plans, land survey and renderings are included in sale."" Boston Landmarks Commission staff have ten calendar days to review applications to demolish properties in Boston for historic significance. If a property is determined to be ""not significant,"" staff can sign off on the demolition. The application for 799 East Third St. was received on Nov. 29, and as of Tuesday, no determination had been made yet. Emily Sweeney can be reached at esweeney@globe.com.

"Sudbury Savoyards carry on a 'Christmas Carol' tradition  Link to Image Al LePage's more than 10-year reign of performing one-man shows of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" for charity has come to an end. But LePage says that won't stop the Christmas spirit from living on. He's passing the reins to six actors from The Sudbury Savoyards, a local theatre company, who will continue LePage's tradition of performing the holiday classic at Longfellow's Wayside Inn in Sudbury and Omni Parker House in Boston. The Savoyards will perform at the Wayside Inn on Friday, Dec. 6, at 7 p.m. and Saturday, Dec. 7, at 2 p.m., with a final show at the Parker House on Sunday, Dec. 15, at 2 p.m. FULL TEXT LePage, director of the National Coast Trail Association, pursued his passion for history and the environment as a Living History Reenactor volunteer with the National Park Service in Oregon and Washington. He got his feet wet and had a debut performance of ""A Christmas Carol"" at a historic mansion in Astoria, Ore., in 2006. Over the years, he continued to perform. ""I eventually decided to do it in Massachusetts, the place I grew up,"" said LePage, who was raised in Framingham. Flying between Oregon and Massachusetts, LePage continued to perform the story for more than 10 years at the Wayside Inn and eventually the historic Parker House. All proceeds from ticket sales went to the Historic Site Preservation Fund of the Wayside Inn as well as local food pantries, he said. LePage says the story's message especially resonates because ""it is about generosity and personal transformation."" LePage emphasized how his performances were more than just acting - they held historical and personal significance too. His final performance last December commemorated the 175th anniversary of when Dickens wrote and published the Christmas classic in 1843. During his last performance he also made sure to bring his father's sweater with him on stage, leaving it on the chair beside him as he performed. ""My father was the only guy that upstaged me. During my performances, he would stand up and say, 'that's my son up there,'"" LePage recalled with a laugh. ""The audience absolutely loved it, they could tell I was blushing."" His father passed away five years ago, but LePage still keeps his memory close. ""I referenced the sweater and said, 'this is in remembrance of my father, so that he can be here with me for the performance too,'"" he recalled. Unable to maintain the costs of flying to and from Massachusetts, LePage, 65, decided to retire from performing in order to direct his efforts back to what he's always had a passion for - the world's climate. This came with a challenge. ""I wanted the story of generosity to continue. I thought, how am I going to do this?"" He passed his legacy to the Sudbury Savoyards, which runs entirely on volunteers. This will be the group's first time performing the show. ""I think it's a wonderful opportunity for us as a Sudbury-based organization to do another noteworthy activity within Sudbury and build a relationship with the inn,"" said Brendon Chetwynd, current chairman of Sudbury Savoyards.

"The Latest: Felons push court to restore voting rights  Link to Image Link to Image NEW ORLEANS (AP) - The Latest on court case seeking to restore voting rights to Mississippi felons (all times local): 1:15 p.m. A key advocate for restoring voting rights to felons in Mississippi says he's fighting to restore his rights as a ""human being."" Dennis Hopkins spoke after judges at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans heard arguments in a case brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP on behalf of six felons including Hopkins. In Mississippi, people convicted of 22 felonies permanently lose the right to vote. They can have their rights restored only by getting a bill passed just for them with two-thirds approval by the Legislature or getting a pardon from the governor. Lawyers for the plaintiffs say Mississippi is one of only three states that permanently bars felons from voting. __ Midnight A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments on whether Mississippi laws that restrict the voting rights of certain felons are unconstitutional. Former convicted felons affected by the state's laws are pushing to have their voting rights restored. The Mississippi Constitution strips people convicted of 10 felonies of the right to vote. Those crimes include murder, forgery and bigamy, and the list was later expanded to 22, including crimes such as timber larceny and carjacking. Those people can get their voting rights restored but only by going through a process of getting individual bills passed just for them with two-thirds approval by the Legislature or getting a pardon from the governor. The plaintiffs argue the laws were enacted in 1890 as a way to disenfranchise black voters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"AP Interview: New IAEA head seeking answers from Iran  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image VIENNA (AP) - The United Nations' atomic watchdog agency is still waiting for information from Iran on the discovery of uranium particles at a site near Tehran, the agency's new director general told The Associated Press on Tuesday in an interview. In his first day as head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi said that the organization has been ""in conversation"" with Iran about the discovery and that it is ""not a closed matter."" ""The process continues,"" he said. ""We have so far not received an entirely satisfactory reply from them, but the exchanges continue."" The U.S. and Israel had been pressing the IAEA for some time to look into the Turquzabad facility, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described to the U.N. in 2018 as a ""secret atomic warehouse."" In November, the agency confirmed that its inspectors had found uranium of man-made origin ""at a location in Iran not declared to the agency."" Israel has alleged that material at the site came from an Iranian military program involving work on nuclear weapons and was subsequently cleared out. Iran denies pursuing nuclear weapons and says its program is peaceful. Responding to criticism that the IAEA dragged its feet in the investigation, Grossi acknowledged that the matter is urgent because samples can degrade. ""The timely response to our questions is very important,"" he added. Grossi, a 58-year-old Argentine diplomat, succeeded Yukiya Amano, who died in July. He takes over for a four-year term at a time when the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers is unraveling. The landmark 2015 deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action promised Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. The IAEA's role has been to inspect and verify Iran's compliance with the deal. With the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the agreement last year and the imposition of new American sanctions, Iran's economy has struggled. So far, the other nations involved - France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia - have been unable to offset the effects, and Iran has slowly been violating the terms of the JCPOA. Amid the economic discontent, many Iranians have taken to the streets recently to protest rising gasoline prices, and the Iranian government has cracked down violently, killing more than 200 people. Despite the unrest, Grossi said his agency's inspectors have still been able to carry out their work, and Iran has been providing access to nuclear facilities. ""There have been certain issues, but we have been working reasonably well,"" Grossi said. ""Necessary precautions are imposed because of the situation but we are working."" ___ Associated Press Writer David Rising in Berlin contributed to this story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Rio Treaty nations move to further isolate Venezuela  Link to Image BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) - Representatives from over a dozen nations that are signatories to a Cold War-era defense treaty for the Americas moved Tuesday to further isolate close allies of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro with economic sanctions. The 1947 Rio Treaty signatories concluded a meeting in Bogota by vowing to cooperate in pursuing sanctions and travel restrictions for Maduro government associates accused of corruption, drug trafficking, money laundering or human rights violations. ""The political, economic and social crisis in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela represents a threat for the peace and security of the continent,"" Colombian Foreign Minister Claudia Blum said in the meeting's final remarks. While the United States and the European Union have targeted Maduro associates with economic sanctions, Latin American nations who are supporting opposition leader Juan Guaidó have largely resorted to diplomatic pressure - and it will be up to each individual nation to decide how to move forward. The promise of enhanced economic pressure against Maduro comes at a time when Venezuela's opposition is faltering. Guaidó has struggled to mobilize supporters onto the streets and dipped in popularity. Meanwhile, fissures within the opposition are coming to light amidst recent controversies involving alleged abuses of power. David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the Rio Treaty's resolution Tuesday marks a ""small victory"" for the opposition but ""not enough to really put them in a different place."" ""Their strategy of maximum pressure seems to be stalling,"" he said. The 19 Rio Treaty member nations have been treading cautiously in pursuing economic restrictions against Venezuela while vowing not to invoke a provision in the accord that authorizes them to pursue a military intervention. The accord instructs signatories to consider a threat against any one of them a danger to all. Colombian President Iván Duque contends that Maduro is offering a safe haven to rebel factions of the National Liberation Army and dissidents with the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, an assertion the Venezuelan leader denies. Duque urged that nations embark on tougher sanctions going forward. ""Here there's no invitation for use of force,"" he said. Despite repeated remarks from Rio Treaty members indicating they will not pursue a military response, Venezuelan leaders contend the signatories are plotting to overthrow Maduro and warning citizens that an intervention could be imminent.

"Harvard graduate students walk off the job after negotiations stall  Hundreds of Harvard graduate students walked out of class and off the job on Tuesday kicking off their first strike after contract negotiations with the university stalled. Students marched for hours trudging down snow-covered sidewalks around Harvard Yard carrying signs, banging on empty plastic cans, and chanting ""What do we want? Contract! What do we do if we don't get it? Shut it down!"" FULL TEXT ""The things we're asking for....it would be really easy for Harvard to provide,"" said Sophie Wilkowske, 24, a graduate student in history. ""We're going to stay out here until they do."" The graduate students were joined on the picket line by some professors and undergraduate students. David Carey, a sophomore, walked out with his Spanish class to support his teaching assistants. Much of classroom learning, as well as the help they receive on papers and tests happens in small groups led by graduate students, Carey said. ""They have certain rights that they need to have protected,"" Carey said. The strike comes after more than a year of negotiations between the newly formed graduate student workers union and Harvard officials. The graduate students, who teach classes, grade papers and work in research labs, said they want to send Harvard administrators a message that their labor is valuable and that they should be compensated fairly and offered more protections against sexual harassment and discrimination. Harvard officials have said that a strike is ""unwarranted."" The two sides have made tentative progress toward an agreement over training, travel and support for international graduate students, but remain divided on several key issues, including pay packages and grievance procedures for sexual harassment complaints. The union is seeking better pay, expanded health care and child care benefits, and an outside arbitrator to handle complaints of sexual harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. Graduate student workers have argued that Harvard has historically been slow to address allegations of sexual harassment against longtime professors and that graduate students need the protection of an independent third party. But Harvard officials said the Title IX sexual harassment complaint process has improved significantly in recent years. While other unions on campus have the option to enter arbitration over sexual harassment complaints, none have used that process, instead choosing to go through the university's Title IX office, Harvard officials said. Stipends for Harvard doctoral students vary by school and range from $35,500 to $43,000 annually. Harvard has proposed an 8 percent pay increase over three years for a majority of the graduate students in the union. But union members said that would end up being less than the 3 percent annual raise many of them have received in recent years. The union has countered with a proposal for a 5 percent raise in the first year of the contract and a 3.5 percent increase in subsequent years, according to union representatives. Nationally, graduate student strikes remain rare, but they are becoming more common. Teaching assistants at the University of Illinois Chicago went on a three-week strike earlier this year, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of classes. Last year, graduate student workers at Columbia University in New York picketed for a week to protest administrators' refusal to negotiate. Columbia eventually agreed to bargain. Most strikes on campus last less 10 days or less. Harvard's graduate students workers have authorized an indefinite strike. Deirdre Fernandes can be reached at deirdre.fernandes@globe.com.

"Remembering - and honoring - Worcester's six fallen firefighters, 20 years later  It was the evening of Dec. 3, 1999, about two hours after the sun set on the city of Worcester, when an off-duty police officer noticed smoke coming from the top of a building on Franklin Street. Within minutes, firefighters were on their way. Little did they know, when they responded to this call, their lives would be changed forever. The Worcester Fire Department, and the city as a whole, would never be same again. The fire that started inside Worcester Cold Storage and Warehouse Co. turned into a deadly blaze that claimed the lives of six firefighters: Timothy P. Jackson, 51; Joseph T. McGuirk, 38; James F. 'Jay"" Lyons III, 34; Thomas E. Spencer, 42; Paul A. Brotherton, 41; and Jeremiah M. Lucey, 38. FULL TEXT Today, several of their children - Spencer's son Danny, Lucey's son Jeremiah, and five of Brotherton's sons - serve on the Worcester Fire Department. In the two decades since the tragic warehouse fire, the city has continued to grieve for their fathers and the rest of the ""Worcester Six,"" and on Tuesday evening city officials will honor them with a memorial service on the 20th anniversary of the fire. At 5:30 p.m. past and present members of the Worcester Fire Department, accompanied by color guard and band, will line up at Union Station and then march down Grafton Street to the Franklin Street fire station, where a memorial ceremony will be held at 6 p.m. featuring remarks by Worcester Mayor Joseph M. Petty, Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito, Worcester Fire Chief Michael Lavoie, City Manager Edward M. Augustus Jr. and comedian and actor Denis Leary. The fire impacted Leary profoundly, as he had personal ties to two of the victims (Lucey was his cousin and Lieutenant Spencer was a childhood friend and high school classmate). On Tuesday Leary tweeted a photograph of Lucey on the job, wearing his firefighter helmet and gear. ""My cousin Jerry Lucey in action for @WorcesterFD,"" Leary wrote. ""Back in the day #NeverForget #Worcester6 20 years ago today."" Leary, who established The Leary Firefighters Foundation in 2000, also announced the release of a new mini-documentary series called ""The Worcester 6: Heroes Remembered.""

In advance of Tuesday's memorial ceremony, the Worcester Fire Department posted an online tribute to Brotherton, Jackson, Lucey, Lyons, McGuirk, and Spencer on Twitter. ""Today, on the 20th anniversary of December 3rd, we remember and honor FF Brotherton, FF Jackson, FF Lucey, FF Lyons, FF McGuirk, LT Spencer. Our Heroes Fallen but not forgotten,"" the tweet said. ""Time may pass, but the impact of their sacrifice lives on within our department and the community we serve."" Some roads will be closed for the memorial event. City officials said there will be temporary road closures in the vicinity of the Franklin Street fire station beginning at 5 p.m., and firefighters from other departments are expected to line the marching route. Travelers should also note that the main entrance to Union Station will be closed from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., but the ADA platform will remain accessible from the station entrance at 45 Shrewsbury St., according to a tweet from MBTA commuter rail officials.

FULL TEXT However, the holiday-themed ad featuring ""Grace in Boston"" has sparked a slew of horrified and disgusted reactions from people online, as well as several publications. The commercial, which was posted to Peloton's official YouTube channel on Nov. 21, portrays a man gifting his wife a stationary bicycle for Christmas. She then takes cellphone videos of her rides - from her first, to her fifth, to her 50th; at 6 a.m., after work, when it's snowing outside. At one point, the instructor on the screen can be heard saying, ""Let's go, Grace in Boston,"" to which the woman exclaims, ""She just said my name!"" In a somewhat surprising twist, however, it turns out that the couple have been watching a home movie of all the clips she has taken - a full year later. ""A year ago, I didn't realize how much this would change me. Thank you,"" the woman says in the ad, which is titled, ""The Gift that Gives Back."" However, many people took issue with the ad for the bike, which starts at $2,245 - before the $39/month            membership fee to stream the service's virtual classes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Fears deepen for families of people held in Iran amid unrest  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - Families of several U.S. and British people held in Iran expressed fear for their loved ones Tuesday amid the deadliest unrest in decades in the Islamic Republic. The relatives spoke at a news conference in Washington to demand the release of spouses and parents held in Iran - in at least one case for more than a decade. Among those who spoke was a daughter of Robert Levinson, the former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007. The protests now roiling Iran, reflecting widespread economic discontent and outrage over spiking gasoline prices, have been an added challenge to families who have gone years without seeing their loved ones. Iranian state television acknowledged Tuesday that security forces shot and killed protesters in multiple cities. ""Of course any kind of protest that goes on in Iran, and any kind of situation, that overlaps potentially with the fact that our families and loved ones are being held there as well,"" said Babak Namazi, whose brother and father are held captive in Iran. ""We've been talking about the brutality of what our family members have been facing. But I guess this is just a reminder of what the abilities and capabilities are."" Prisons are more overcrowded now because of the demonstrations, the internet has been down, and communication has been even more complicated than it already is, Namazi said. Sarah Moriarty, one of Levinson's seven children, said she was heartened by Iran's acknowledgment last month that it had an open case before its Revolutionary Court after years of denying any involvement in his disappearance. Moriarty said she interpreted the development as Iran's first acknowledgment that it had indeed taken Levinson into custody, though Iran has also said it regards Levinson's case as a ""missing person"" file. She said she believes it's clear that Iran knows where her father is and is in a position to send him home immediately. ""This is incredibly significant because it means that they have a case against my father, and it means that they have him,"" Moriarty said. ""And we want to see him, and we want him to be released immediately."" Nearly two dozen of Levinson's relatives are expected in a Washington court this week to testify in a wrongful death lawsuit against Iran that seeks damages against the government. ""We want Iran to know that this is not acceptable, and a big portion of our lawsuit is punitive damages because we want them to discourage them from doing this practice to anyone else,"" Moriarty said. Levinson disappeared from Iran's Kish Island on March 9, 2007. For years, U.S. officials would only say that Levinson, a meticulous FBI investigator credited with busting Russian and Italian mobsters, was working for a private firm on his trip. In December 2013, The Associated Press revealed Levinson in fact had been on a mission for CIA analysts who had no authority to run spy operations. Also present for the news conference was Richard Ratcliffe, whose wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, is a British-Iranian charity worker held in Iran for more than three years. He said that though different Western nations have their own approaches to hostage negotiations, ""none of them have worked."" He said sanctions should be considered as one option of punishment for hostage taking. ""There should be a real clear cost to hostage taking,"" he said. ""It should be an anathema in the modern world.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Man who fought London attacker says he acted instinctively  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image LONDON (AP) - The Polish porter who fought off a knife-wielding attacker in the London Bridge stabbings said Tuesday that he acted instinctively in trying to prevent others from being hurt. In a statement issued by London's Metropolitan Police, the man identified only as Lukasz said he had gone to work as normal at Fishmongers' Hall ""when the unimaginable and tragic terrorist attack happened."" Usman Khan stabbed two people to death and injured three others Friday before being shot and killed by police on the bridge. Earlier accounts of the incident suggested that Lukasz had prodded Khan with a narwhal tusk that had been ripped from the wall of the hall. But Lukasz said the person shown in some video of the day was not him. ""I and several others tried to stop a man from attacking people inside the building,"" he said. ""I did this using a pole I found. Someone else was holding a narwhal tusk."" Khan was attending an event at the hall and had returned for the afternoon session when he started stabbing people. Police believe he acted alone. He was pursued onto London Bridge and restrained by staff from the venue and others from the conference, including former inmates. Police shot him after he flashed what looked like a suicide vest. It turned out to be fake. ""The man attacked me, after which he left the building,"" he said. ""A number of us followed him out but I stopped at the bollards of the bridge. I had been stabbed and was later taken to hospital to be treated. I am thankful that I have now been able to return home."" Khan's family said Tuesday they were ""saddened and shocked"" by what he did. Khan's relatives also issued a statement through the police, saying that the ""totally condemn his actions and we wish to express our condolences to the families of the victims that have died and wish a speedy recovery to all of the injured."" Khan had been released from prison last year after serving eight years for an al-Qaida-linked plot to set up a training camp in Pakistan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"AP FACT CHECK: Trump's misstatements at NATO summit  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday wholly misrepresented the U.S. record on international trade disputes and dismissed as a mysterious ""rumor"" his own statement from months ago about Britain's health system. Here's a look at some of his statements from London, where's he is attending a NATO meeting: TRUMP: ""We won, in the World Trade Organization, we won seven and a half billion dollars. We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations."" - remarks with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. THE FACTS: He is wildly wrong to state that the U.S. never won victories in disputes taken to the trade organization before him. The U.S. has always had a high success rate when it pursues cases against other countries at the WTO. In 2017, trade analyst Daniel Ikenson of the libertarian Cato Institute found that the U.S. had won 91% of times it brought a complaint that ended up being adjudicated by the Geneva-based trade monitor. As Ikenson noted, countries bringing complaints to the organization tend to win because they don't bother going to the WTO in the first place if they don't have a strong case. As for his claim that the U.S. ""won"" $7.5 billion from the WTO, that's not quite right. Trump was referring to a WTO decision in October  siding with the U.S. on imposing tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European imports annually. The value of the tariffs on those imports is much less than $7.5 billion. The WTO announcement culminated a 15-year fight over EU subsidies for Airbus - a fight that began long before Trump was in office. ___ TRUMP: ""We have a tremendous amount of captured fighters, ISIS fighters over in Syria. And, they're all under lock and key, but many are from France, many are from Germany. Many are from U.K. They are mostly from Europe."" - remarks with French President Emmanuel Macron. MACRON: There are ""very large number of fighters ... ISIS fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq and the region."" Those from Europe are ""a tiny minority of the overall problem."" THE FACTS: Trump is incorrect to say the Islamic State fighters who were captured and held by the Kurds in Syria are mostly from Europe. Of the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. Most of the captured fighters - about 10,000 - are natives of Syria or Iraq. European nations have indeed been reluctant to take detainees who came from Europe, frustrating Trump. But such detainees are far fewer than the majority he frequently claims. ___ TRUMP, speaking about claims that Britain's state-funded health care system would be part of future U.K.-U.S. trade talks: ""I don't even know where that rumor started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn't want to. If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it."" - remarks with Jens Stoltenberg. THE FACTS: He's referring to his own past statements as a ""rumor."" Asked about the National Health Service during a visit to Britain in June, he said ""when you're dealing in trade, everything's on the table. So, NHS or anything else."" The service, which provides free health care to all Britons, could in fact be a bargaining chip in U.S.-U.K. trade talks. U.S. health-services firms can already bid for contracts if they have European subsidiaries. A future government could increase the amount of private-sector involvement or let U.S. companies bid directly. As well, the U.S. could demand during trade talks that Britain pay American pharma firms more for drugs. Medicines became a big issue in negotiations on a revamped North American free trade deal, as the U.S. pushed successfully for tighter restrictions on the development in Canada and Mexico of generic versions of U.S.-patented drugs. Leaked documents from preliminary talks between U.S. and U.K. negotiators over two years from July 2017 - released by the Labour Party last week - said ""patent issues"" around ""NHS access to generic drugs will be a key consideration"" in talks. It's an overstatement to say the national health service as a whole would be up for sale, as Labour has alleged will happen if Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives win the Dec. 12 election and try to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the U.S. Britain would not be ""selling off"" the health service, as Labour asserts, because taxpayers would still be footing the bill. But it's also improbable to think U.S. negotiators would ""want nothing to do"" with Britain's health care market, despite Trump's words. ___ TRUMP, on protecting oilfields in Syria: ""We have the oil, and we can do with the oil what we want."" - remarks with Stoltenberg. THE FACTS: That's not true. The oil in Syria belongs to Syria and the U.S. can't do anything it wants with it. As secretary of state, Rex Tillerson reviewed whether the U.S. could make money off the oil-rich areas and concluded there was no practical way to do so, said Brett McGurk, Trump's former special envoy to the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State. ""Maybe there are new lawyers now, but it was just illegal for an American company to go and seize and exploit these assets,"" McGurk told a panel on Syria held in October by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Stephen Vladeck, a national security law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said there is no solid legal argument the Trump administration could make if it sought to claim Syria's oil. While Trump has said he will withdraw the bulk of roughly 1,000 American troops from Syria, he's made clear he will leave some military forces in the country to help secure the oil from any Islamic State resurgence. The Pentagon has said it is committed to sending additional military forces to eastern Syria to ""reinforce"" control of the oil fields and prevent them from ""falling back to into the hands of ISIS or other destabilizing actors."" ___ EDITOR'S NOTE - A look at the veracity of claims by political figures. ___ Lawless reported from London.

"Israel to UN: Uprooted Jews should be seen as refugees  Link to Image Link to Image UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Israel wants the United Nations to recognize as refugees hundreds of thousands of Jews who fled Arab and Muslim countries in the last century, its U.N. envoy said Tuesday. Ambassador Danny Danon told the U.N. General Assembly that he plans to propose a resolution about what he called ""the 'forgotten' Jewish refugees"" to counter what Israel sees as a one-sided focus on Palestinian refugees. ""We don't hear the international community speak of them when they discuss the refugees of the conflict, perhaps because it doesn't serve the Palestinian narrative,"" Danon said. He didn't detail his planned resolution, except to say that it would ""acknowledge the wrong done"" to the Jews in question and ""make right the injustice that they suffered."" There was no immediate response from the Palestinian mission to his remarks. Earlier Tuesday, Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour reiterated appeals for humanitarian aid for Palestinian refugees. Danon's remarks came as the assembly weighed a draft resolution reiterating a roster of longstanding positions on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. The proposed measure includes calls for continued humanitarian and economic aid to the Palestinians and a stop to Israeli settlement of areas Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war - a stance given new resonance by the recent U.S. announcement that it no longer believes the settlements violate international law. Danon said an estimated 850,000 Jews were forced out of Iraq, Egypt, Morocco, Iran, and many other countries during the 20th century after enduring violence and persecution. Many fled to the new state of Israel after the war surrounding its creation in 1948. The uprooted Jews were absorbed in Israel, where their descendants now make up about half the country's Jewish population. Refugee recognition may be largely symbolic at this juncture, but it reflects Israel's determination to highlight what it considers to be years of pro-Palestinian bias at the U.N., including on the issue of refugees. An estimated 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes during the war. A U.N. agency still exists to assist them and their descendants - all told, about 5.5 million people - in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The Palestinians and the U.N. see its Relief and Works Agency as a lifeline for impoverished people with no state of their own. International support for it is ""an indispensable source of hope and stability until a just solution for the Palestine refugees is realized,"" Mansour told the General Assembly on Tuesday. Israel and the United States, however, have lambasted UNRWA as anti-Israel and badly run. The U.S. cut its funding for the agency from $360 million in 2017 to $60 million in 2018 and nothing this year, calling the agency ""irredeemably flawed."" On the settlements issue, the draft resolution stresses a call for ""an immediate halt to all settlement activities."" Hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, areas that Palestinians claim for their future state. The U.N. and the Palestinians say the settlements are illegal and undermine hopes for the long-discussed two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 2016, a U.N. Security Council resolution called the settlements ""a flagrant violation under international law."" The U.S. announcement last month upended a four-decade-old State Department legal opinion and subsequent years of carefully calibrated U.S. opposition to settlement construction. Israeli leaders welcomed the U.S. decision. Palestinians bitterly protested it. ___ Associated Press writer Aron Heller in Jerusalem contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These local mothers made an interactive map of some of the best sledding spots in the region  Link to Image If you're a parent of one of the many children who didn't have to trudge off to school Tuesday because of the major            snowstorm, and you've already exhausted all of your options to            avoid going stir crazy indoors, it may be time to grab a sled and step outside. Luckily, a group of local mothers can tell you exactly where to go. FULL TEXT Community Kangaroo, a collaborative website that tracks and logs family-friendly activities around the state, has been building a map of some of the best sledding spots in the Boston suburbs for the past few years. To date, the team of 18 mothers who contribute to the website has amassed dozens of locations where little ones - or not so little ones - can shred some powder. The suggestions are based on input from residents in the communities where each hill can be found, and covers a wide swath of places from Boston to Worcester. ""It can be hard to know where an open hill is to sled,"" said Sharon Aigler, a Millis resident and mother of three who founded Community Kangaroo in 2015. ""Also for people who have a favorite hill, a lot of times they want to try something else. Maybe they have outgrown their favorite hill or want some variety."" The interactive Sledding Map sorts each sledding location into three color-coded categories, so parents can figure out which area works best for their kids. There are ""Small Hills,"" which are marked in purple and described as ""perfect for pre-K"" and those just getting their boots wet; ""Large Hills,"" which are marked in green and aimed at sledders of varying experience and age; and ""Intense Thrill"" hills. The latter are marked in red and are mostly former ski slopes - hills that are ""not for the faint of heart,"" the website warns. When a user clicks on one of the color-coded icons, which are scattered around the state, it pulls up the site's address as well as additional information about its particular features. For example, a purple spot in Stoughton is listed as a ""Great little toddler/learning hill."" And in Marlborough, sledders can find an ""Extreme hill."" Be warned: the map also comes with a disclaimer. Because it was built based on information  gathered from online groups and through word-of-mouth, Community Kangaroo reminds parents bringing their children to any of the locations pinpointed on the map to be cautious when exploring each spot. ""We can't ensure accuracy or safety, and have not independently verified permission on private property,"" the website says. ""Sled at your own risk."" Aigler, a former high school teacher, said the map can be helpful to parents because sledding isn't something that's advertised like a business. You either know where the spots are, or you don't. Putting the locations all in one place also eliminates the hassle of driving around until you find the right location for your child. ""There are lists of sledding hills out there, but they cover just the big ones,"" Aigler said. ""So we try to cater to everybody."" The website, which covers about 60 towns, is always accepting new additions to its map. If sledding isn't on your family's to-do list this winter, Aigler said Community Kangaroo offers a plethora of alternatives, including dates and times of fairs, festivals, and other events, and a map of where the best Christmas and holiday lights can be found. ""The strength of the website is the team of moms scattered throughout the suburbs,"" Aigler said. ""And when they're all finding information right near them, then we get some great work done.""

"Asylum seekers jam US border crossings to evade Trump policy  Link to Image PHOENIX (AP) - For months, asylum seekers have been prohibited from filing their claims at U.S. border crossings under a much-criticized Trump administration policy. Now some are sprinting down vehicle lanes or renting cars to try to make it inside the U.S. The migrants' efforts are causing traffic delays at Arizona crossings because U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials had to barricade lanes used by cars legally entering the U.S. from Mexico, officials said. Shoppers, teachers and visitors traveling to the U.S. through Nogales, Mexico, endured up to five-hour waits Monday and over the weekend, causing concerns among local officials whose tax base relies on Mexican shoppers, especially during the holiday season. In a statement, Customs and Border Protection said it's committed to the safety of border crossers, adding that there's been an increase of incursions through vehicle lanes ""by asylum seekers attempting to evade established entry processes."" ""These tactics interfere with CBP officers conducting their responsibilities and exacerbates wait times for daily commuters,"" the agency said in a statement. ""CBP will not allow ports to be overrun, or unauthorized entry."" The traffic jams could hurt sales at stores in Nogales, Arizona that depend on Mexican shoppers during the holiday season, said Mayor Arturo Garino. Garino, a part-time teacher, said some students and teachers who live in Mexico but attend and work at schools across the border in the U.S. have been leaving their homes as early as 5 a.m. to arrive on time. Garino said Mexican authorities were not doing enough to stem the problem. The Arizona Daily Star reported the Nogales, Sonora, police officers were checking cars headed north to the border on Monday afternoon. The metal barricades are large and are meant to seal off traffic lanes. About 3,000 migrants are living in Nogales, Mexico as they wait their turns to seek asylum, said Katie Sharar, communications director for the Kino Border Initiative, a religious-based group that provides meals to needy migrants on the Mexican side of the border. Under a policy by the Trump administration known widely as ""metering,"" the asylum-seekers must wait in an unofficial line in Mexico until U.S. authorities call them up in a process that usually lasts several months. Another policy, colloquially known as ""Remain in Mexico,"" requires asylum seekers to return to Mexico after they have made credible fear claims to justify their asylum requests and wait there while their immigration cases are pending. ""I think there's just a lot of desperation and uncertainty. They don't know what's happening to them, they don't know how the policy changes are gonna affect them,"" Sharar said. Sharar said she wasn't familiar with the migrants who have run through vehicle lanes. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to email and phone messages regarding questions about the migrants who rushed the border, what countries they come from and whether they were detained or faced criminal charges. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, said his first concern is public safety and that he is confident that U.S. officials will resolve the border traffic problems. ___ Associated Press writer Bob Christie in Phoenix contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Animal rights group accuses Harvard Medical School of violating Animal Welfare Act  An animal rights group has filed a federal complaint against Harvard Medical School after learning that a monkey died of strangulation at a research facility this summer. Stop Animal Exploitation Now filed an official complaint against the school on Nov. 30, saying it failed ""to handle animals as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma"" and did not list ""any primates used in projects causing unrelieved pain/distress"" in annual reports to the US Department of Agriculture. FULL TEXT The complaint included a Harvard Medical School report, filed with the National Institutes of Health, that described how the monkey died. ""The macaque had strangled herself on her hanging surrogate cover, which was being used for enrichment,"" the report stated. ""The macaque had ripped a hole in the surrogate cover and stuck her head through it."" In response, all hanging surrogates and large cloths were removed from the cages. Lab, animal care, and veterinary staff are ""re-evaluating all aspects of the surrogate enrichment program,"" the report stated. The complaint accused the school of violating the Animal Welfare Act. ""Since this project involves socially isolating primates, preventing them from even seeing human or primate faces, it is highly likely that this project cause these animals to experience unrelieved distress,"" the complaint stated. Primate research is helping to eradicate diseases such as AIDS and Parkinson's disease, Harvard Medical School said in a statement. ""We will continue to work to ensure that the important research will further medical breakthroughs, while being conducted in an ethical manner,"" the school said. Nathan Herschler, who directs the New England Anti-Vivisection Society, said Harvard ""has proven time and again that they are incapable of appropriately providing care for captive primates."" Last month, animal rights advocates, including a Harvard Law School program, sued the US Department of Agriculture, alleging that the agency failed to ensure adequate living conditions for primates, including rhesus macaques, baboons, and marmosets. ""We are bringing this case to compel the USDA to put in place clear, enforceable laws that will ease the burden of suffering on non-human primates, some of our closest relatives in the animal kingdom,"" said Brett Richey, a Harvard Law School student who helped file the lawsuit on behalf of the school's new Animal Law & Policy Clinic.

Feldman ""specializes in constitutional studies, with a particular emphasis on the relationship between law and religion, free speech, constitutional design, and the history of legal theory,"" according to the Harvard Law website. After receiving his bachelor's degree in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from Harvard University in 1992, he was selected as a Rhodes Scholar and earned a D.Phil. from Oxford University in 1994. He received his law degree from Yale Law School in 1997, according to the Harvard website. He clerked for a District of Columbia Appeals Court judge as well as for Supreme Court Justice David Souter. Before joining the Harvard faculty he was a law professor at New York University School of Law. When he left NYU for Harvard in 2007, Elena Kagan, dean of Harvard Law at the time (she is now a Supreme Court justice) hailed him as one of the ""stars of his generation.""  He had been dubbed ""Most Beautiful Brainiac"" by New York magazine during his time in that city. Esquire in 2008 called him ""a public intellectual for our time."" In 2003, he brought his legal skills to bear in a turbulent situation, serving as senior constitutional adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, and subsequently advising members of the Iraqi Governing Council on the drafting of the Transitional Administrative Law or interim constitution, according to the Harvard Law website. The New York Times reported at the time that questions were being raised about Feldman's youth - he was 32 at the time - but a consensus was emerging that, because of his studies in Islamic thought at Oxford and in constitutional law, he was a good choice. Feldman grew up in Boston as an Orthodox Jew. He learned Hebrew and Aramaic to read the ancient and medieval texts taught at the Maimonides School, a private Jewish school in Brookline. He then started Arabic at 15 in summer school, the Times reported. His interest in the law came after his interest in Islam. His expertise in the two fields suddenly became especially valuable after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, the Times reported. What might Feldman say to the committee? In a PBS-TV interview in late October with Walter Isaacson, Feldman may have given some clues. He said he felt President Trump's pressuring Ukraine for a political benefit was an impeachable offense. ""To me, the abuse of power is the thing that the Constitution says that the president should be be impeached for. And you define 'abuse of power' by the idea that the president is doing something that's within his constitutional authority, it's within his power, like putting pressure on a foreign government, but he's doing it not to serve the interests of the United States but to serve his personal interest and the interest of getting reelected. And that's, to my mind, very clearly what's going on,"" he said. ""What matters is the president is overtly saying to Ukraine, 'Do these investigations,' and the only party who can benefit from those investigations is Donald Trump,"" said Feldman. He said he felt it was also an impeachable offense when Trump later issued a similar call publicly to China. ""That's also openly calling on a foreign state to help the president get reelected not to serve the interests of the United States as a republic. That's the textbook definition of an abuse of power,"" he said. The other expert witnessesare: Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law School, Michael Gerhardt of the University of North Carolina School of Law; and Jonathan Turley of the George Washington University Law School. Feldman, Karlan and Gerhardt are being called to testify by Democrats, while Turley was selected by the committee's Republican members. Jeremiah Manion of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

"Black victims underrepresented in named violent crime laws  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image CLEVELAND (AP) - The slayings of Reagan Tokes and Alianna DeFreeze had much in common. Both were abducted, raped and killed in Ohio in 2017. Tokes was a 21-year-old college student, DeFreeze a 14-year-old seventh grader. Both their killers, previously convicted sex offenders, were subsequently found guilty. Yet only one victim got a law with her name on it - Tokes, who was white. That disparity in so-called namesake laws represents a national trend: White crime victims are much more likely to get crime bills named after them than black victims. An Associated Press analysis found that more than eight in 10 stand-alone laws named for victims of violent crime since 1990 honored white victims or groups of victims that included at least one white person. Namesake laws have been a popular way for lawmakers to recognize victims of horrific crimes and enact tough-on-crime laws, and many of them have become common parlance in the national criminal justice discussion. AMBER Alerts that warn the public to look out for a missing child are named for Amber Hagerman, a white 9-year-old from Texas who was killed after being abducted while riding her bike with her brother. Sex offender registries and notification systems were set up under federal and state laws named for 6-year-old Adam Walsh, 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling and 7-year-old Megan Kanka, all white children abducted and killed by sex offenders. Racial disparity in such laws has left black victims such as DeFreeze underrepresented. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, black young people in her age range - from 12 to 19 - experience violent crime at significantly higher rates than their white peers, including being five times more likely to be victims of homicide. The AP's analysis showed that only about 6 percent of namesake bills related to violent crimes were named after black victims. The Tokes and DeFreeze murders have led some Ohio lawmakers to question whether racial preference is a factor in the naming of crime laws. The issue is back before lawmakers in at least three separate bills that are expected to see more debate this month. ""All of our babies, all of our women, all of our men, people who lose their lives, everybody is worthy of being acknowledged,"" said Ohio state Rep. Stephanie Howse, a Cleveland Democrat who is black and who publicly objected to the Legislature's differing treatment of Tokes and DeFreeze last year. ""The system that we are in has made a determination of who is more valuable than others."" DeFreeze's mother, Donnesha Cooper, said it was devastating when a bill that would have created an ""Alianna's Alert"" failed to pass last year. She wanted a stand-alone bill named for her daughter that would require schools to inform parents within an hour if a child without an excuse didn't show up for class. The family and a pending wrongful death lawsuit allege that's something her school, E Prep & Village Prep Woodland Hills, a Cleveland charter school, did not do in DeFreeze's case. The school is contesting the suit's allegations; its attorney declined comment. Her daughter was abducted near a city bus stop while on her way to early morning tutoring. Cooper didn't learn the teen was missing until 4 p.m., when she says it was too late to save her. ""It was hurtful, because I thought that the bill having her name on it would be a part of her legacy, I really did. So that everybody would know that this bill was passed for the sake of future lives - and my daughter lost her life in the process, for a change to happen,"" she said. ""And they didn't even put her name on it."" Democratic state Sen. Sandra Williams, who proposed the bill, said a compromise - extending the required alert window from one to two hours - was necessary to appease wealthier school districts. The weakened language finally cleared the House at the end of last year, folded quietly into a sweeping education bill that also addressed teacher preparation, cybersecurity and issues related to the state's universities. The Reagan Tokes Act is back in the Legislature this month as lawmakers advance provisions that were excluded from the first bill. They also are considering other namesake bills. One is Erin's Law, a child sexual abuse prevention bill named for survivor and activist Erin Merryn, who is white; another, Aisha's Law, is named for a Cleveland domestic violence victim who was murdered by her ex-lawmaker husband and was black. ""Having a law named for a white victim versus an African American victim or a Hispanic victim does not inherently mean that people of all races don't benefit from that legislation,"" said Teresa Kulig, an assistant criminology professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. ""But it is kind of an important indication of who is highlighted in these laws."" Kulig and criminologist Francis T. Cullen co-authored a 2016 report that found that 86% of 51 laws named for victims of murder, rape and other violent crimes from 1990 to 2016 were named for white victims. The AP analysis, which included laws from the study as well as bills enacted since 2016, found the pattern continued largely unchanged. Exceptions included the Lavinia Masters Act, aimed at eliminating Texas' rape kit backlog, and Tennessee's JaJuan Latham Act, which toughened criminal penalties in drive-by shootings. Both laws were named for black victims and passed just this year. That contributed to the 6% of bills named for black victims. Another 5% were named for other minorities and the rest were named for whites or groups that included at least one white person. Several of the groups also included blacks or other minorities. Kulig said it is important to acknowledge that named laws generally spring from tragedies: abductions, murders, domestic assaults, child abuse cases. Pointing out the racial disparities isn't intended to diminish the pain of the mostly white families such laws honor, she said. Ohio Rep. Kristin Boggs, a Columbus Democrat, sponsored the Reagan Tokes Act. She said the case exposed flaws in Ohio's parole system that demanded a legislative response. Tokes, a psychology major at Ohio State University, was kidnapped after leaving her restaurant job, raped and killed. Her body was later found in a park in Grove City, near Columbus. Tokes' killer had been released from prison two months before and was wearing an electronic monitor at the time. ""To me, it just feels like she was someone who was truly organically interwoven into a community in the deepest ways, and what happened to her was just so terrifying because everyone saw a piece of themselves in her,"" said Boggs, who is white. Boggs said she couldn't deny that some implicit racial bias exists in the Ohio Legislature, but said she doesn't believe her colleagues are judging namesake bills based on victims' ethnicity. The Tokes legislation, she said, was propelled by passionate lobbying by the family, which declined an AP request for comment through their attorney, and intense media attention to the case. Opponents of namesake laws, including civil-rights groups, criminal defense attorneys and some lawmakers, see an added twist: The new criminal penalties imposed by namesake bills named largely for white victims fall disproportionately on blacks. ""Here comes Annie's law, Laura's law, Marcy's law, Judy's law, and soon we'll have a whole sorority of victims enshrined in the Ohio criminal code,"" Barry Wilford, then-public policy chairman at the Ohio Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, told a news conference called to highlight the disparity. Not everyone sees it that way. Crime victim advocates say enacting laws named for lost loved ones can provide an important outlet for grieving families. Cooper said working to promote a law named after her daughter was the only thing that got her out of the house after her daughter's murder. She still believes her effort was worth it, even if it resulted in legal changes that fell short of a stand-alone namesake law. ""When you hear laws that are named after people, you know what they are and you know why they came to be,"" Cooper said. ""Like, everybody knows the AMBER Alert. And everybody should know the Alianna Alert, because it was horrific. But it will save lives."" ___ Associated Press news researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Carr Smyth at http://www.twitter.com/jcarrsmyth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"'Unicorn puppy' will stay with Missouri rescue mission  Link to Image Link to Image CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (AP) - A dog who was dubbed the unicorn puppy because of a tail-like growth between his eyes will remain with the founder of a Missouri rescue group, despite more than 300 offers to adopt him. The beagle-mix puppy, named Narwhal the Little Magical Furry Unicorn, was rescued in November by Mac's Mission in southeast Missouri. He drew international attention when his picture hit social media, prompting all the adoption offers but also some negative attention, including death threats, said Rochelle Steffen, founder of the Mac's Mission in Jackson. Those two factors - plus the dog's winning personality - convinced Steffen to reverse an earlier decision to find a new home for Narwhal, she told The Southeast Missourian. She said her tiny rescue could not properly vet the 300 adoption applicants and she was concerned by ""stupid, ugly comments (online) about this sweet little puppy."" People have shown up at the rescue in Jackson because of the dog, prompting security measures and meetings ""by appointment only,"" Steffen said. Narwhal is watched at all times by Steffen and trusted volunteers. Steffen said she wanted to keep the dog safe and was concerned he could be exploited by someone without his best interests at heart. ""If somebody is going to make money off of him, I would love to see it go toward the rescue, and save thousands more dogs,"" Steffen said. People have made ""giant"" offers to buy him, Steffen said. ""But he's not for sale."" And the dog's cute personality made it difficult to consider giving him to someone else, she said. ""It's not just a decision from me,"" she said. ""The whole rescue cannot fathom him leaving. We all fell in love with him."" Mac's Mission is currently involved in a court case involving the sale of a previously adopted dog, which taught Steffen that the organization loses control over an animal's fate once it is adopted. And the mission's former treasurer, Elizabeth Hann, is awaiting trial on charges that she stole $120,000 from the organization, which specializes in caring for animals with special needs. ""We have had a rough couple of years here,"" Steffen said of Mac's Mission. ""Lots of loss, lots of hurt."" And Mac, the mission's current ""spokesdog"", turns 9 in January. Steffen said she wasn't sure what was going to happen until Narwhal came along, saying he is ""absolutely, exactly what we needed."" She said the dog will be a spokesdog for a ""Different is awesome"" campaign and the long-term plan is to train him as a therapy dog. For now, Steffen is concentrating on letting him grow, and getting him fully vaccinated and socialized. ___ Information from: Southeast Missourian, http://www.semissourian.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stocks fall a 3rd straight day amid more trade worries  Stocks closed broadly lower and bond prices rose sharply on Wall Street Tuesday after President Trump cast doubt over the potential for a trade deal with China this year. Stocks of technology and industrial companies and banks accounted for much of the sell-off, which extended the S&P 500's losing streak to a third day. Utilities and real estate stocks rose as traders favored less-risky assets. Trump said he has ''no deadline'' for a trade deal and doesn't mind waiting until after the 2020 election to make one. Investors had been hoping for a deal this year, or at least enough progress to stave off new US tariffs on Chinese goods, including smartphones and laptops, scheduled to start Dec. 15. FULL TEXT Tensions between the two nations flared anew last week after Trump signed legislation expressing US support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. ""We're running out of time and the markets are finally woken up to 'Hey, there's a risk out there and maybe things aren't going to be all good after all,'"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading & derivatives at Charles Schwab. The S&P 500 index fell 20.67 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,093.20. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 280.23 points, or 1 percent, to 27,502.81. The index was briefly down 457 points. The Nasdaq dropped 47.34 points, or 0.6 percent, to 8,520.64. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gave up 4.95 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,602.63. Stocks have been racking up losses this week, giving up some of the market's solid gains from a strong November rally fueled partly by investor optimism about the prospects for a trade deal between Washington and Beijing. Pressure has been building on both sides to complete what Trump has called a limited ''Phase 1'' deal before the new tariffs on Chinese goods kick in Dec. 15. ""We're less than two weeks away from new tariffs that will be implemented on a bunch of consumer goods that have never had tariffs on them, and I think that's when the consumer really starts to feel the pain,"" Frederick said. Wall Street is also weighing the potential for an expanded series of trade disputes. On Tuesday, Trump proposed tariffs on $2.4 billion in French products in retaliation for a tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon, and Facebook. That follows a threat Monday to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum from Argentina and Brazil. The lack of a trade deal before the year ends could mean the market is in for a turnaround from a strong, record-setting November. The S&P 500 had its best month since June with a 3.4 percent gain because of cooling trade tensions and optimism that a resolution to the dispute was near. Two days of deflated hopes has already sent the S&P 500 about 1.5 percent lower and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has slipped 1.7 percent. December is a typically solid month for the stock market, with the S&P 500 making gains regularly since the last recession ended in 2009. Last year, though, fears about a recession and rising interest rates hurt the major indexes. Technology stocks led the losses Tuesday. The sector is highly sensitive to twists in the trade dispute because many of the companies rely on China for sales and supply chains. Apple slumped 1.8 percent, and Intel fell 2.8 percent. Bank stocks also suffered heavy losses as investors headed for the safety of bonds and pushed yields lower. Banks rely on higher bond yields to charge more lucrative interest rates on mortgages and other loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell sharply to 1.72 percent from 1.83 percent late Monday. Bank of America shed 1.8 percent, and Citigroup fell 1.6 percent. Utilities and real estate companies held up the best as investors shifted money to the safe-play sectors. Traders sent shares in Cleveland-Cliffs 10.7 percent lower after the iron-ore miner said it will pay $1.1 billion for steel maker AK Steel. US steel producers have struggled since the Trump administration put a 25 percent steel tariff into place last year. Domestic demand has slumped as oil and gas drillers pull back on purchases of steel pipe. The price for hot rolled steel has slid almost 30 percent this year. AK Steel rose 4.2 percent. Lands' End vaulted 21 percent after the clothing maker reported surprisingly good fourth-quarter earnings and raised its profit forecast for the year. Benchmark crude oil rose 14 cents to settle at $56.10 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 10 cents to $60.82.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Solutions for the traffic crisis? Globe readers have plenty.  Link to Image The Globe Spotlight Team's series on our region's transportation crisis, ""Seeing Red,"" hit a nerve with readers. Facing some of the country's worst rush-hour traffic, and grappling with a strained and unreliable transit system, hundreds of Globe readers poured out their perspectives on the problem, sharing their Boston-area transportation horror stories and suggesting ways to break the gridlock. The Globe received more than 600 online comments on the series, and more than 200 readers responded to requests for proposed solutions and other feedback, including tips and comments e-mailed to commuting@globe.com and a special            feedback forum linked from each story. Reader questions will be aired at a            Globe event Tuesday night, Dec. 3, 6 to 7:30 p.m. at 1 Faneuil Hall Square. The event, moderated by Globe columnist Shirley Leung, features Spotlight reporters who worked on the series, as well as transportation officials. Here are some of the readers' solutions, edited and condensed: FULL TEXT Carrots and sticks ""We haven't done enough with social psychology to encourage and reward good transportation behaviors. Boston should have a sustainable commuting challenge. Let's scrap the Safest Driver Competition that the city of Boston introduced this year and replace that with an app that gamifies commuting. Points would be awarded based on mode/distance/location and could be redeemed at sponsoring merchants or donated to charity."" Sophie Schmitt ""Households with more than one car should pay a surcharge. We should increase tolls at rush hour. And add a surcharge on Uber/Lyft at rush hour that goes directly to public transportation."" Geoff Foley Family rail discounts ""My husband and I pay a combined total of $756 a month on commuter-rail costs. This does not include parking. We often can't pay the full cost of a monthly pass upfront so we have to pay for 10-day passes, splitting up the cost of our passes through the month. This has caused an extreme financial strain on our family. There are days when we cannot afford to both ride the train to work, so one of us has to either drive in and play the street-meter parking game, or work from home. If the commuter rail offered a discounted monthly pass for families who commute together on the train, this could ease a lot of strain on families, and some might be more inclined to ride the train."" Courtney Landers Telecommuting ""There needs to be better, more supported and incentivized work-from-home policies in all areas of government and the private sector. I understand the importance of face time in meetings, but in this age of technology, combined with an ability to track productivity at home, it's irresponsible to structure the workday for non-essential personnel in such a way that they're fighting Boston traffic (and contributing to Boston's carbon output) just to get to an office space to make phone calls and write e-mails."" Elizabeth Holmgren ""Wait 10 to 20 years until the people in their 30s and 40s now become executives and allow a majority of their employees to work from home. Executives today, who came up in the age of typewriters, desk phones, and water coolers, cannot wrap their minds around the fact that 75 percent of employees today could do their entire job from their couch."" Robbie Vogel Regional planning ""Let's create a new quasi-public state agency that acts as a hub between all of the various modes of transportation available to manage the state's transportation network. This hub would combine walking, bike and scooter rentals, rideshare companies, buses, trains and subways, ferries, and parking garages. Combine this with a user application that allows people to plan their trips and provides an incentive for advance planning. With all this in one place, users would simply enter their destination and when they needed to get there, and the system would figure out the rest, with all services being paid for at a single point."" Chris Trudel ""We need north-south public transportation. The median strips of 128 and 495 should have light rail/bus lines with stations at all the exits. Currently if you want to take a train south to north it is almost impossible. All transportation goes into and out of Boston. But we live in a larger and larger area of hybrid urban/suburban greater Boston. If you live on a spoke you must have a job on that spoke. If not, you are guaranteed an over two-hour round trip anywhere."" Gregory Gonser Bicycling ""I'm 68 years old and commute 30 miles a day by bike. If I can do it, certainly the younger workers can. But we need many more protected bikeways, and businesses need to provide secure bike parking and locker rooms. A visit to Copenhagen or Amsterdam would demonstrate the viability of building infrastructure for bike commuting."" Rick Treitman ""Expand biking infrastructure! So many people I know would love to bike commute, but are afraid to ride in traffic, especially given Boston's aggressive driving culture. And who can blame them?"" Yue ""There are many free parking lots on the bicycle trails leading into downtown. But parking is forbidden after sunset, so one would need to leave work at 3:45 p.m. to bicycle out to the lot to get out in time. Governor Baker's response to requests to extend the parking past sunset: nothing. It is not just success that gives us bad traffic. It is also poor leadership."" ForayChannel Traffic enforcement ""What about actually enforcing our current traffic laws? That would seem to be the least controversial way to make driving much more expensive. I have lived in Boston for 15 years. I can count on one hand the number of times I have seen cars pulled over/ticketed in Boston for running red lights, speeding through a crosswalk when pedestrians are trying to cross, or blocking the box at an intersection. Yet these violations happen every single time I drive or walk anywhere in Boston. I know we are famous for the worst drivers in the country. But that terrible driving is tolerated. If current laws were enforced, driving would be MUCH more expensive. With several $150 tickets per week, maybe some car commuters would see more value in taking the train."" Keely Boyer ""One easy way to help with traffic flow in the city would be to install cameras at lights to ticket those who cause gridlock at major intersections. Tickets would automatically charge drivers and eliminate issues such as profiling or getting ticket quotas met."" Paul McCann Park and ride ""We should have express buses to downtown Boston (and maybe some to Kendall Square and the medical area) from park-and-ride lots at about every other exit on route 128 - and maybe some in other locations between 128 and 495. And the enticement is - the buses aren't free. Passengers GET PAID to take the buses. Everyone loves to get money. Ridership would go through the roof."" Mark Seliber ""I'm amazed at how little parking there is to make public transportation feasible. If there were available parking and monthly contracts that made parking and riding affordable, maybe people would."" Dori Water transportation ""We need to get serious about water transportation. Boston Harbor Now's Inner Harbor Connector concept is a particularly weak swipe at a very promising transit opportunity. In a harbor city with neighborhoods packed into every nook and cranny around a 40-mile shoreline, and with our traffic congestion problems, a four-stop system that serves wealthy communities exclusively at twice the cost of a T fare is a recipe for environmental-justice embarrassment and risks failure for the same reason water transit has failed in the past in Boston: It is planned as a niche service for special interests and not as real urban transit. Let's create water transit that's designed to serve the entire region."" Chris Marchi Commuter bus ""Though there are plans to increase the frequency of commuter-rail service into Boston, a potential solution to address the more immediate need is to offer commuter-bus service to complement the commuter-rail lines. These buses would pick up at the commuter-rail stop and serve as an additional option for commuters currently opting to drive themselves."" Maggie Political gridlock ""It seems the head honchos in this state just don't get it. Governor Charlie Baker, House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo, and State Senate President Karen E. Spilka are all in la la land. It's ridiculous that they get free parking and transportation allowances. How about we charge them market rates for that parking and instead offer a bonus to take public transit?"" mitrefcp5 Right turns ""I grew up and learned to drive in California, where turning right after coming to a full stop at a red light was legal. I was astonished and dismayed when I came to Massachusetts to find that it was not legal. My amazement recurred through the years as measures to legalize right-turn-on-red were repeatedly defeated in the State House. Opponents feared that geezers with walkers, babies in prams, and little Shih Tzus on leashes would be mowed down in crosswalks on a daily basis. Then the impossible happened: After 20-some years a right-turn-on-red law passed! I couldn't believe it! Get the booze! Call the hookers! We are gonna paaaar-TAY. But wait. My celebration was premature. Before the measure became law, they stamped out a million ""NO TURN ON RED"" signs and put them up, well, everywhere. So now you could turn right against a red light except for where you couldn't, which was everywhere. I lived in Cambridge for 36 years. I am now back in California. We have ""NO TURN ON RED"" signs here, but they are located where the view to the left is obstructed. I don't mind those at all. But when the right lane is stacked up unnecessarily at countless intersections all over town, the aggregate effect on slowing traffic must be significant. If I were a Boston politician I'd make some noise about it."" John Troy Tips and comments about the Spotlight series ""Seeing Red"" can be sent to commuting@globe.com.

"Boston College's AJ Dillon, John Phillips named to All-ACC first team  Two Boston College players were named to the All-ACC first team on Tuesday: running back AJ Dillon and offensive lineman John Phillips. FULL TEXT Dillon has 1,685 rushing yards on the season and is averaging 140.4 yards per game, both good for third-most in the nation. He's also scored 14 touchdowns, including one on Saturday in BC's bowl-clinching win over Pittsburgh. Dillon is BC's record-holder for career rushing yards with 4,382; he needs 227 yards to become the ACC's career leader. It's the third consecutive year Dillon has been named to the first team. Phillips has started every game for the Eagles this season, taking 932 snaps and allowing just one sack. His 87.3 pass block grade is the highest of any ACC offensive guard, according to Pro Football Focus. It is his first time being named to the first team. Junior offensive guard Zion Johnson, junior offensive guard Ben Petrula, and redshirt junior offensive linebacker Max Richardson earned second-team honors. Center Alec Lindstrom and tight end Hunter Long, both redshirt sophomores, were named to the third team.

"Encore by sea, even in winter  Link to Image EVERETT - Before they hit the card tables or slot machines, visitors who arrive at Encore Boston Harbor on the casino's water shuttle often check in first with dockmaster Jay Larcome. He's offering deals of his own. ""Welcome to Encore Boston Harbor,"" Larcome says as he hands $7 food-and-drink vouchers to a group of women disembarking one of the 35-passenger yachts the casino has been using to ferry in passengers up the Mystic River from Boston. He also hands them a coupon for a free trip back when they're done. FULL TEXT In a business that places a huge emphasis on first impressions, Encore counts on Larcome, a  66-year-old retired Newburyport police officer, to ensure a smooth entrance for the hundreds of customers who come by sea each day. ""We have a lot of great responses from a lot of guests,"" he says, noting that the boats, which cost more than $1 million each, do most of the heavy lifting. ""Encore spared no expenses on building these boats."" And as the casino enters its first winter - it opened in late June - it will be his job to make sure the boats keep running smoothly even as the ice and snow bear down. The first thing you notice about the dock where Larcome spends much of his time is the view. The facade of the 27-story hotel and casino curves to embrace the waterfront. So if you don't turn your head to look at the giant Exelon power plant nearby, the manicured grounds of the resort might make you forget about the rest of the industrial waterfront. Link to Image Larcome has always been a boat guy. He lived on Plum Island for a long time, and still calls Newburyport home. After retiring from the police force 22 years ago, he spent years in management at clubs including Provincetown Marina and Charlestown Marina. But in all of his years boating in and around Boston, he never explored this part of the Mystic. ""It was a commercial type of thing,"" he says. ""So there was really never much for us to do. This amazes me."" The casino is now a marine destination of its own. In addition to its four MGM Yachts (built just down the shoreline at Boston BoatWorks in Charlestown), Encore also allows boat owners to reserve dock space if they want to navigate there themselves. The industrial heritage of the Mystic is actually a help for the casino as it seeks to keep running the shuttle service year round. Commercial interests like the Exelon plant use icebreakers to keep the travel path clear for shipping, which means the casino's little boats will have no problem slipping through. ""We're not going to be the first ones to break the ice, so to speak,"" Larcome says. The casino expects demand for the shuttle to drop off over the winter. Trips now run from 11:45 a.m. to 11:10 p.m.; in the summer they started at 7 a.m. The shuttles stop at Long Wharf, East Boston, and the World Trade Center. But every $7 ride counts for one less car trip, which is important to Encore operator Wynn Resorts. Under pressure from neighbors and regulators, the company is trying to keep vehicle traffic to a minimum - so far, it appears to have done that. Larcome says he hopes customers will understand that they are not going to be exposed to the elements when they come aboard the shuttles, which are operated for the casino by Bay State Cruise Company. ""I don't think people know the boats are heated,"" he says. The boats are fully enclosed, with seasonal windows in the back that can be opened during the more cheerful summer months. It was warm on a recent afternoon despite the crisp weather outside, and the view of downtown Boston and the North End and Charlestown waterfronts were undiminished. Larcome and the five dock assistants who work for him won't be exposed to the elements either. There is a heated shack (with faux-marble countertops, naturally) where they can wait for the yachts to come in, and Larcome spends a good amount of his time inside Encore, where there is a transportation office. Link to Image But a recent batch of colder temperatures has given him a sense of what's to come as the weather rolls in. When Larcome arrived in freezing temperatures at 5:30 a.m. on a recent day, his staff alerted him to ice coating part of the floating concrete dock, so his first task was to call in maintenance to break it up. Nothing like that would affect service, he says - though extreme weather is an issue even in summer. ""I think the hardest thing is just making sure that we can keep on a timely schedule,"" he says. ""We might have service interrupted if we have a big snow storm.""

In October, Brandt embraced Guyger in court after she was sentenced to a decade in prison for shooting Botham Jean in his apartment last year.

"Stocks slump as Trump says trade deal with China can wait  Link to Image Stocks fell broadly Tuesday after President Trump cast doubt over the potential for a trade deal with China this year and threatened to impose tariffs on French goods. The selling knocked the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than 350 points lower and had the S&P 500 on track for its third straight loss as the market continued to give up gains after a strong November rally. Trump said he has ''no deadline'' for a deal and didn't mind waiting until after the 2020 election to make one. Investors had been hoping for a deal this year, or at least enough progress to stave off new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, including smartphones and laptops, scheduled to start Dec. 15. FULL TEXT Wall Street is also weighing the potential for an expanded series of trade disputes after a month of relative calm. On Tuesday, Trump proposed tariffs on $2.4 billion in French products in retaliation for a tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook. That follows a threat Monday to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum from Argentina and Brazil. Technology stocks led the losses. The sector is highly sensitive to twists in the trade dispute because many of the companies rely on China for sales and supply chains. Apple slumped 2.2% and Intel fell 2.9%. Bank stocks also suffered heavy losses as investors headed for the safety of bonds and pushed yields lower. Banks rely on higher bond yields to charge more lucrative interest rates on mortgages and other loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell sharply to 1.71% from 1.83% late Monday. Bank of America shed 2.3% and Citigroup fell 1.8%. Utilities and real estate companies held up the best as investors shifted money to the safe-play sectors. KEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index was down 0.9% as of 2:45 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow fell 344 points, or 1.2%, to 27,439. The index was briefly down 457 points. The Nasdaq fell 0.9%. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell 0.6%. Asian and European markets also fell. DECEMBER DIP? The lack of a trade deal before the year ends could mean the market is in for a turnaround from a strong, record-setting November. The S&P 500 had its best month since June with a 3.4% gain because of cooling trade tensions and optimism that a resolution to the dispute was near. Two days of deflated hopes has already sent the S&P 500 about 2% lower and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has slipped 2.1%. December is a typically solid month for the stock market, with the S&P 500 making gains regularly since the last recession ended in 2009. Last year, though, fears about a recession and rising interest rates hurt the major indexes. METAL MARRIAGE: Cleveland-Cliffs plunged 12.1% after the iron-ore miner said it will pay $1.1 billion for steel maker AK Steel. U.S. steel producers have struggled since the Trump administration put a 25% steel tariff into place last year. Domestic demand has slumped as oil and gas drillers pull back on purchases of steel pipe. The price for hot rolled steel has slid almost 30% this year. AK Steel rose 2.8%. DRESSED FOR SUCCESS: Lands' End vaulted 15.2% after the clothing maker reported surprisingly good fourth-quarter earnings and raised its profit forecast for the year. ECONOMIC WATCH: Wall Street still has a busy week ahead for some key economic gauges following disappointing manufacturing and construction data on Monday. Investors will get a better view of the services sector, which makes up the bulk of the economy, with a November report on Wednesday. Economists expect a very slight drop in growth. Employment data is also on tap this week. On Wednesday, payroll processor ADP will release its latest survey of hiring by private companies. The Labor Department will release its closely watched employment report on Friday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kamala Harris ends White House bid, citing lack of funding  Link to Image SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Sen. Kamala Harris told supporters on Tuesday that she was ending her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, an abrupt close to a candidacy that held historic potential. ""I've taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,"" the California Democrat said. ""My campaign for president simply doesn't have the financial resources we need to continue."" A senior campaign aide said Harris made the decision Monday after discussing the path forward with family and other top officials over the Thanksgiving holiday. Her withdrawal marked a dramatic fall for a candidate who showed extraordinary promise in her bid to become the first black female president. Harris launched her campaign in front of 20,000 people  on a chilly January day in Oakland, California. The first woman and first black attorney general and U.S. senator in California's history, she was widely viewed as a candidate poised to excite the multiracial coalition of voters that sent Barack Obama to the White House. Her departure erodes the diversity of the Democratic field, which is dominated at the moment by a top tier that is white and mostly male. ""She was an important voice in the race, out before others who raised less and were less electable. It's a loss not to have her voice in the race,"" said Aimee Allison, who leads She the People, a group that promotes women of color. Harris ultimately could not craft a message that resonated with voters or secure the money to continue her run. She raised an impressive $12 million in the first three months of her campaign and quickly locked down major endorsements meant to show her dominance in her home state, which offers the biggest delegate haul in the Democratic primary contest. But as the field grew, Harris' fundraising remained flat; she was unable to attract the type of attention being showered on Pete Buttigieg by traditional donors or the grassroots firepower that drove tens of millions of dollars to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. In her note to supporters, Harris lamented the role of money in politics and, without naming them, took a shot at billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, who are funding their presidential bids. ""I'm not a billionaire,"" she said. ""I can't fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete."" Harris suffered from what allies and critics viewed as an inconsistent pitch to voters. Her slogan ""For the people"" referenced her career as a prosecutor, a record that was viewed skeptically by the party's most progressive voters. Through the summer, she focused on pocketbook issues and her ""3 a.m. agenda,"" a message that never seemed to resonate with voters. By the fall, she had returned to her courtroom roots with the refrain that ""justice is on the ballot,"" both a cry for economic and social justice as well as her call that she could ""prosecute the case"" against a ""criminal"" president. At times, she was tripped up by confusing policy positions; particularly on health care. After suggesting she would eliminate private insurance in favor of a fully government-run system, Harris eventually rolled out a health care plan that preserves a role for private insurance. Stumbles, often of the campaign's making, continued to dog Harris into the winter, stymieing her ability to capitalize on solid moments. Harris kicked off November with a well-received speech at a massive Iowa dinner, just a day after her campaign announced it would fire staff at its Baltimore headquarters and was moving some people from other early states to Iowa. Her message was regularly overshadowed by campaign aides and allies sharing grievances with the news media. Several top aides decamped for other campaigns, one leaving a blistering resignation letter. ""Because we have refused to confront our mistakes, foster an environment of critical thinking and honest feedback, or trust the expertise of talented staff, we find ourselves making the same unforced errors over and over,"" Kelly Mehlenbacher wrote in her letter, obtained by The New York Times. Mehlenbacher now works for businessman Bloomberg's campaign. With Harris' exit, 15 Democrats remain in the race for the nomination. Several praised her on Tuesday. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a memorable debate stage tussle with Harris this summer, called the senator a ""solid person, loaded with talent."" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders commended Harris for ""running a spirited and issue-oriented campaign."" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one of two black candidates still in the campaign, called Harris a ""trailblazer."" Harris anchored her campaign in the powerful legacy of pioneering African Americans. Her campaign launch on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday included a nod to Shirley Chisholm, the New York congresswoman who sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination 47 years ago earlier. One of her first stops as a candidate was to Howard University, the historically black college that she attended as an undergraduate. She spent much of her early campaign focusing on South Carolina, which hosts the first Southern primary and has a significant African American population. But Harris struggled to chip away at Biden's deep advantage with black voters who are critical to winning the Democratic nomination. Harris and her aides believe she faced an uphill battle - and unfair expectations for perfection - from the start as a woman of color. Her campaign speech included a line about what Harris called the ""donkey in the room,"" a reference to the thought that Americans wouldn't elect a woman of color. Harris often suggested it was criticism she faced in her other campaigns - all of which she won. Her departure from the presidential race marks her first defeat as a political candidate. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Peoples in New York and Bill Barrow in Mason City, Iowa, contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indictment accuses 25 jail officers of using excessive force  Link to Image BALTIMORE (AP) - More than two dozen correctional officers in Baltimore were indicted Tuesday on charges that they used excessive force on prisoners at state-operated jails in the city, authorities said. The 25 indicted officers are accused of assaulting and threatening detainees at correctional facilities, tampering with evidence and falsifying documents, said Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, whose office secured the indictments. The indicted officers face a combined total 236 counts, including charges of assault and participating in a criminal gang, Mosby said. Maryland corrections secretary Robert Green said all the indicted officers have been on administrative leave since 2018, when the state Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services began investigating the allegations. ""This case represents our strong effort to root out people who don't belong in the field where public safety and rehabilitation is the mission,"" Green told reporters. ""This is a disturbing case, but it does not represent nor should it cast a shadow on the commitment and integrity of the exceptional correctional professionals in this department."" Mosby said 21 of the 25 indicted officers were taken into custody on Tuesday. All of them were members of a tactical unit, with a paramilitary command structure, operating inside four detention facilities in Baltimore. Mosby said the officers used violence and intimidation to ""maintain its dominance and its operational territory"" inside the jails. ""All 25 of these correctional officers have allegedly abused their power and abused our trust,"" she added. The indictment includes alleged offenses against 25 prisoners and incidents that occurred as far back as 2016, authorities said. Gov. Larry Hogan said in a statement that his administration has no tolerance for corruption in the state's correctional system. ""Our correctional officers have one of the most difficult jobs in all of public safety, and we will not let the criminal behavior of the few tarnish the great work of the nearly 5,000 dedicated officers who serve with distinction every single day,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weinstein is due to appear Friday at a bail hearing necessitated by changes that go into effect Jan. 1. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performing a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006. His trial is scheduled to start Jan. 6. He is free on $1 million bail and maintains that any sexual activity was consensual. The new changes include eliminating bail for nonviolent felonies and accelerating the timetable for prosecutors to give evidence to the defense.

"Trump looks beyond DOJ watchdog's Russia report  Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he expected an upcoming watchdog report to be ""devastating"" on the origins of the Russia investigation that dogged his presidency for nearly two years, but also suggested Americans should really be more interested in the findings of a federal prosecutor appointed to do a similar probe. Speaking to reporters in London, Trump said the ""big report"" on the Russia investigation will come from U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was appointed by Attorney General William Barr in July to lead the inquiry into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It's not clear when that probe will be completed. But the Justice Department's inspector general is scheduled to release a report on Monday on the early stages of the FBI's Russia investigation. The president's comments could mean that Monday's report, centered in part on the use of a secret surveillance warrant to monitor the communications of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, wouldn't be a full-throated confirmation of his allegations that the Russia probe was a politically-motivated ""witch hunt."" Republicans could instead play up that Durham's inquiry is far from done, and could uncover wrongdoing that the inspector general wasn't examining. ""I do think the big report to wait for is going to be the Durham report,"" Trump said. ""That's the one that people are really waiting for."" Trump's remarks come a day after The Washington Post  reported that Barr told associates he disagrees with a finding from the inspector general's upcoming report that the FBI was justified in July 2016 in opening a counterintelligence investigation into members of the Trump campaign. The newspaper, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, reported that Barr had not been swayed by Inspector General Michael Horowitz's rationale for concluding that the FBI had a good enough reason to open the investigation that would become the special counsel's probe. While the president said the inspector general's report was also very important, and that he's heard ""it's devastating,"" the watchdog is limited in what he was examining, and Durham has a wider investigative scope. The inspector general does not have the power to compel former employees to be interviewed. Durham is conducting a criminal investigation examining what led the U.S. to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign and the roles that various countries played in the U.S. probe. He is also investigating whether the surveillance methods and intelligence gathering methods used during the investigation were legal and appropriate. Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, is a career prosecutor who has led investigations into the FBI's cozy relationship with Boston mobsters like James ""Whitey"" Bulger and the CIA's use of tough interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects. The FBI's counterintelligence investigation later morphed into special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Mueller concluded that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election, but his investigation didn't find sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia. Mueller also examined 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice and has pointedly said he could not exonerate the president. The inspector general uncovered that an FBI lawyer is suspected of altering a document related to surveillance of Page, according to a person familiar with the case who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke to AP only on the condition of anonymity. The inspector general cannot bring criminal charges, but can make referrals to federal prosecutors if potential crimes are uncovered. Trump and his supporters are likely to seize on any findings of mistakes or bad judgment in the report to support their claims of a biased investigation. Supporters of the FBI, meanwhile, are likely to hold up as vindication any findings that the investigation was done by the book, or free of political considerations. The Justice Department has no plan to submit a formal rebuttal as part of the inspector general's report, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations surrounding the report. The attorney general has taken a hands-on role in leading the Durham investigation and has traveled overseas with Durham for personal meetings with foreign law enforcement officials, some of which were initiated by Trump. The president has asked the Australian prime minister and other foreign leaders to help Barr with the Durham investigation. Trump's interactions with foreign leaders - and Barr's role in those discussions - have received heightened scrutiny as the House conducts an impeachment inquiry into the president's efforts to press the leader of Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden at the same time as military aid was being withheld from the country. The report from the intelligence committee on the House impeachment inquiry was made public Tuesday. ___ Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Federal utility fined $145K for inaccurate nuke plant info  Link to Image NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Federal regulators have fined the nation's largest public utility $145,000 for submitting incomplete and inaccurate information on a backup system at its Watts Bar Nuclear Plant. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission notified the Tennessee Valley Authority of the proposed fine regarding the Spring City, Tennessee plant in a Nov. 19 letter. The utility, in turn, says it has taken corrective action, adding that the backup configuration was never used. According to the commission, the incorrect and inaccurate information that the utility provided from July 2010 to January 2015 didn't result in consequences, but it was used in part to approve reactor licensing requests at the plant. The commission has said the backup setup would've been inadequate to power safety equipment in certain accident scenarios. ""Had TVA provided complete and accurate information during the NRC inspection, and as part of approval of license amendments, the NRC would have conducted significant additional inspection and/or inquiry, or reached different regulatory conclusions,"" the commission's letter states. TVA spokesman Jim Hopson said the federal utility inadvertently used the inaccurate information to develop a configuration that would have been rarely used. ""This did not affect public safety, did not impact daily operations, and this plant alignment was never used,"" Hopson said in a statement. ""TVA has completed an updated safety analysis and is providing the accurate and complete documentation to the NRC.""

"All-America Watch: Championship weekend's best matchups  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Only the best of the best get to play this weekend in college football. Championship weekend crowns the winner of 10 Bowl Subdivision conferences and matches up some big-time players. A look at some of the potential All-Americans who will be matching up in major college football's biggest trophy games. The AP All-America team presented by Regions Bank will be announced Dec. 16. American Athletic Conference No. 21 Cincinnati at No. 16 Memphis Ahmad Gardner, CB, Cincinnati vs. Antonio Gibson, WR, Memphis. Gardner is a freshman who has quickly developed into a lock-down corner. He has returned two of his three interceptions for touchdowns. Gibson is a versatile playmaker. The senior is the Tigers' second-leading receiver, averaging 20.8 yards per catch with seven touchdowns and has also run for 233 yards and three scores on 20 carries. Atlantic Coast Conference No. 22 Virginia vs. No. 3 Clemson Bryce Perkins, QB, Virginia vs. Isaiah Simmons, LB, Clemson To be realistic, Perkins won't be making many All-America teams with so many terrific quarterbacks around the country. But he is one of the most dynamic players in the country, carrying the Cavaliers' offense (303 yards per game in total offense, tops in the ACC). Simmons is one of the most versatile defenders in the country, a hybrid who can line up all over the field. He has 14 tackles for loss. Big 12 No. 8 Baylor vs. No. 6 Oklahoma Bravvion Roy, DT, Baylor vs. Creed Humphrey, C, Oklahoma The 333-pound Roy clogs the middle for the Big 12's top defense (4.77 yard per play) and has 10½ tackles for loss. Humphrey might be the best center in the country, helping pave the way for the Sooners' running game, which is No. 1 in the Big 12 at 260 yards per game. Big Ten No. 10 Wisconsin vs. No. 2 Ohio State Chris Orr, LB, Wisconsin vs. J.K. Dobbins, RB, Ohio State Orr is an active linebacker with 13.5 tackles for loss and two fumbles forced. The Badgers stingy defense has allowed just seven rushing touchdowns. Dobbins is on tear lately, with 368 yards rushing in the last two games against Penn State and Michigan. He also had 163 on 20 carries in the first meeting against Wisconsin. Conference USA UAB at Florida Atlantic Garrett Marino, DL, UAB vs. Harrison Bryant, TE, Florida Atlantic Ok, ok. It's not likely a 290-pound interior defensive lineman and 240-pound pass catching tight end will be bumping into each other much Saturday. But these are the best players on each team. Bryant is a legit All-America candidate with 61 catches for 965 yards and six scores, Marino has 12.5 tackles for loss for what has been far and away C-USA's best defense. Mid-America Conference Miami (Ohio) vs. Central Michigan Travion Banks, CB, Miami (Ohio) vs. JaCorey Sullivan, WR, Central Michigan Banks has been one of the best defensive players in the MAC, with four interceptions and five other passes broken up. Sullivan is Central Michigan's big-play receiver, averaging 15.5 yard per catch. Banks could also see a lot of Kalil Pimpleton, who leads the MAC in catches with 73. Mountain West Hawaii vs. Boise State Cedric Byrd II, WR, Hawaii vs. Curtis Weaver, DE, Boise State Another one where the two won't go head-to-head, but if you're looking for All-America contenders, these are the guys. Byrd is first in the Mountain West in catches with 91 and third in receiving yards with 1,049 and 10 touchdowns. Weaver leads the conference in sacks with 13.5 and is a leading contender for Mountain West defensive player of the year. Pac-12 No. 14 Oregon vs. No. 5 Utah Penei Sewell, OT, Oregon vs. Bradley Anae, DE, Utah Big-time matchup. Sewell is on the short list of best offensive lineman in the country. The sophomore has the size and athleticism of a future top NFL draft pick. Anae is the best pass rusher (12.5 sacks) on the Pac-12's best defense. Across the line, the matchup of Oregon's offense and Utah's defense should be nasty fight between a bunch of a big, talented players. Southeastern Conference No. 4 Georgia vs. No. 1 LSU Eric Stokes, CB, Georgia vs. Ja'Marr Chase, WR, LSU The whole Georgia defense vs. LSU offense should be terrific.

"Boston Center for the Arts delays residency program by a year  Responding to broad criticism over its plan to evict dozens of longtime artists, the Boston Center for the Arts has proposed delaying a new residency program by a year and offering at least 25 percent of its studios to artists who currently rent space in its sprawling South End complex. FULL TEXT The center's leaders on Monday told artists who rent heavily subsidized workspace on Tremont Street that the residency program will not begin until June 2021, and that 10 spaces would be set aside for applicants among the approximately 40 artists who work there now, many of them for decades. The artists had been told in September that they would have to vacate the city-owned building by May 1, 2020, and reapply with no guarantees for admission to the residency program. Called Studio 551, the program is designed to attract a wide array of visual and performing artists for six months to six years. Many current tenants complained at the time that they had not been involved in the planning, which had been under way for a year, and that they did not know any specifics until they were unveiled at a meeting that was ostensibly called to celebrate the BCA's 50th anniversary. Gregory Ruffer, who led the meeting as BCA director, resigned in October following allegations that he had sent sexually suggestive emails a decade ago to a young man who studied under him in Florida. Emily Day, who was named co-director after Ruffer's departure, told the Globe that the new proposals were drafted with the intent of having ""a more transparent and collaborative process."" Day said that the new proposal evolved after discussions with the Massachusetts Cultural Council, the neighborhood association, and the artists at 551 Tremont St., which the center leases for $1 through a 99-year agreement with the city. ""We have a duty to make this a more public process,"" Day said. ""We can look back and wish we could have done this differently, but it's important now to do the right thing."" In a statement, a large group of the artists said that ""both parties agreed to having additional meetings ... in order to further discuss and resolve our differences, so that a truly constructive, equitable, and forward-looking plan might be devised for Studio 551."" The artists said that a mediator will be sought to help resolve differences between the tenants and the center. Day said the selection process would have two phases: Current tenants would submit applications in spring 2020, followed in the autumn by applications from new, prospective artists-in-residency. The candidates would be judged by other artists from many disciplines, Day said. Some studio space might be set aside for low-income candidates and Boston residents who cannot afford workspace in an increasingly expensive city. Anita Walker, executive director of the Massachusetts Cultural Council, welcomed the delay. ""However, there is still work to be done,"" Walker said. ""Artists would be well served by predictability in what lies ahead and when, assistance in dealing with the financial cost of moving, and concrete solutions to their need for space to do their work.""

"Devils fire coach Hynes after dismal start to season  Link to Image NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - John Hynes paid the price for the New Jersey Devils failing to deliver on the high expectations created by having three No. 1 overall draft picks in the lineup. Hynes was fired as coach Tuesday after a 9-13-4 start that left the team in last place in the Metropolitan Division and with the NHL's second-worst record. General manager Ray Shero announced the move roughly 20 minutes before Hynes was schedule to speak to the media before the Devils' game against the Las Vegas Golden Knights. Hynes had been coach for four-plus seasons. Shero said assistant Alain Nasreddine would become the interim coach and Peter Horachek, a pro scout for the team, would join the coaching staff as an assistant. Shero was expected to address the media before the game. The dismissal comes a day after the Devils were ripped by the Buffalo Sabres 7-1. That game followed a 4-0 loss at home to the rival New York Rangers on Saturday. The Devils had high hopes entering the season after drafting Jack Hughes with the No. 1 overall pick just two years after taking Nico Hischier with the No. 1 pick. The other first overall pick on the roster is Taylor Hall, who won the league MVP award in 2018 after leading New Jersey to the playoffs. The Devils are the third team to change coaches this season. Toronto fired Mike Babcock two weeks ago and Calgary parted way with Bill Peters last week. Hynes, who was hired by the Devils in June 2015, had a 150-159-45 record in 354 career regular-season games. When the New Jersey made the postseason in '18, it was the first time since going to the Stanley Cup Final in 2012. Hynes ranks second in team history in games coached, wins and points (345). ""John played an integral role in the development of this team in establishing a foundation for our future and we are grateful for his commitment, passion and unmatched work ethic,"" Shero said in a statement. ""John is a respected leader, developer of talent and friend which makes this decision difficult. We are a team who values and takes pride in accountability to the results we produce. ""We are collectively disappointed in our performance on the ice, and believe changes were needed starting with our head coach,"" Shero added. I have been consistent in my desire to build something here in New Jersey that earns the respect of teams throughout the league and pride in our fans. That is not where we were heading and for me to tolerate anything less was not acceptable."" Nasreddine played for six different NHL organizations during his 15-year pro career with Chicago, Edmonton, Florida, Montreal, the Islanders and Pittsburgh. Horachek was a longtime assistant coach for the Nashville Predators, as well as interim head coach of the Florida Panthers and the Maple Leafs. He has been a pro scout with the club since 2015. ___ More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and            https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Man charged for growing 63 marijuana plants; says he thought he could grow 99 with medical marijuana card  Link to Image A North Attleborough man pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges that he illegally grew 63 marijuana plants in a detached garage next to his home. Michael Alves, 41, told police after they searched his home and garage in October that he is a registered medical marijuana patient and that he thought his medical card gave him the authority to grow up to 99 plants, according to court records. In Massachusetts, households with just a single adult can grow up to six marijuana plants; households of two or more adults can grow up to 12 plants. FULL TEXT Police searched his home on Oct. 11 after a several-week-long investigation that included analyzing his electricity bills and finding that the bills for his garage were unusually high. Police said the garage electricity bills were ""15 to 20 times higher than the main residence,"" according to an incident narrative report submitted to the court - as much as $2,496.83 for the month of April. Officers found plants behind three different doors inside the garage, including 26 mature plants and 37 small plants. Inside a storage room, they also found a scale, plastic bags, eight bags of loose marijuana, and a tote with dried marijuana. Inside Alves's house, they found loose buds, three bags of dried marijuana, and a duffel bag with $6,980 in cash, entirely in $20 bills, according to the court documents. Alves was not home when police searched his home, but his 18-year-old son - who was home - called Alves, who spoke to an officer on the phone and told him that he was in Miami. The officer said Alves ""asked me several times if he was going to be arrested."" ""I advised him I wanted to speak to him as soon as possible and he would be facing consequences for his actions,"" the officer wrote in his incident report. Alves pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Tuesday in Attleboro District Court to one count of the unlawful manufacturing, distribution, dispensing, cultivation, or possession of a Class D substance (marijuana). He was released on personal recognizance. Felicia Gans can be reached at felicia.gans@globe.com.

"Black victims underrepresented in named violent crime laws  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image CLEVELAND (AP) - The slayings of Reagan Tokes and Alianna DeFreeze had much in common. Both were abducted, raped and killed in Ohio in 2017. Tokes was a 21-year-old college student, DeFreeze a 14-year-old seventh grader. Both their killers were previously convicted sex offenders. Yet only one victim got a law with her name on it - Tokes, who was white. That disparity in so-called namesake laws represents a national trend: White crime victims are much more likely to get crime bills named after them than black victims. An Associated Press analysis found that more than eight in 10 stand-alone laws named for victims of violent crime since 1990 honored white victims or groups of victims that included at least one white person. Only 6 percent were named for black victims. Namesake laws have been a popular way for lawmakers to simultaneously recognize victims of horrific crimes and enact tough-on-crime laws, and many have become common parlance in the national criminal justice discussion. AMBER Alerts that warn the public to look out for a missing child are named for Amber Hagerman, a white 9-year-old from Texas who was killed after being abducted while riding her bike with her brother. Sex offender registries and notification systems were set up under federal and state laws named for 6-year-old Adam Walsh, 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling and 7-year-old Megan Kanka, all white children abducted and killed by sex offenders. Racial disparity in such laws has left black victims such as DeFreeze underrepresented. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, black young people in her age range - from 12 to 19 - experience violent crime at significantly higher rates than their white peers, including being five times more likely to be victims of homicide. The Tokes and DeFreeze murders have led some Ohio lawmakers to question whether racial preference is at work in the naming of crime laws. The issue is back before lawmakers in at least three separate bills that are expected to see more debate this month. DeFreeze's mother, Donnesha Cooper, said it was devastating when a bill that would have created an ""Alianna's Alert"" failed to pass last year. She wanted a bill named for her daughter that would require schools to inform parents within an hour if a child without an excuse didn't show up for class. The family and a pending wrongful death lawsuit allege that's something her school, E Prep & Village Prep Woodland Hills, a Cleveland charter school, did not do in DeFreeze's case. The school is contesting the suit's allegations; its attorney declined comment. Her daughter was abducted near a city bus stop while on her way to early morning tutoring. Cooper didn't learn the teen was missing until 4 p.m., when she says it was too late to save her. ""It was hurtful, because I thought that the bill having her name on it would be a part of her legacy. ... So that everybody would know that this bill was passed for the sake of future lives - and my daughter lost her life in the process, for a change to happen,"" she said. ""And they didn't even put her name on it."" Instead, language creating the alert was watered down and tucked quietly into an unrelated piece of legislation. ""Having a law named for a white victim versus an African American victim or a Hispanic victim does not inherently mean that people of all races don't benefit from that legislation,"" said Teresa Kulig, an assistant criminology professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. ""But it is kind of an important indication of who is highlighted in these laws."" Kulig co-authored a 2016 report that found that 86% of 51 laws named for victims of murder, rape and other violent crimes from 1990 to 2016 were named for white victims. The AP analysis, which included laws from that study as well as bills enacted since 2016, found the pattern continued largely unchanged. Exceptions included the Lavinia Masters Act, aimed at eliminating Texas' rape kit backlog, and Tennessee's JaJuan Latham Act, which toughened criminal penalties in drive-by shootings. Both laws were named for black victims and passed just this year. Kulig said named laws generally spring from unspeakable tragedies - abductions, murders, domestic assaults, cases of child abuse - and studying racial disparities isn't intended to diminish the pain of the mostly white families such laws honor. Ohio Rep. Kristin Boggs, a Columbus Democrat who is white, sponsored the Reagan Tokes Act. She said the case exposed flaws in Ohio's parole system that demanded a legislative response. Tokes, a psychology major at Ohio State University, was kidnapped after leaving her restaurant job, raped and killed. Tokes' killer had been released from prison two months earlier and was wearing an electronic monitor at the time. While she acknowledged some implicit racial bias no doubt exists in the Ohio Legislature, Boggs said she doesn't believe her colleagues are judging namesake bills based on victims' ethnicity. The Tokes legislation, she said, was propelled by passionate lobbying by the family, which declined an AP request for comment through their attorney, and intense media attention to the case. Opponents of namesake laws see an added twist: The new criminal penalties imposed by namesake bills named largely for whites fall disproportionately on blacks. ___ Associated Press news researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Carr Smyth at http://www.twitter.com/jcarrsmyth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"'All hands on deck' to plow snow in communities that saw more than two feet of snow in 48 hours  In some communities in Massachusetts where the first major snowfall of the season generated more than two feet of snow in 48 hours, it was all hands on deck to plow the streets, officials said. Winchendon and Royalston in northern Worcester County were hit the hardest, according to the National Weather Service. They received over            two feet of snow from the start of the storm Sunday afternoon to Tuesday afternoon. Albert Gallant, the director of public works of Winchendon, said the town has received 27 inches of snow since 2 p.m. on Sunday. FULL TEXT ""It's just hard to keep up with that kind of amount,"" he said. ""It's not the season or the earliness, it's the amount in such a short period of time."" Taming the overwhelming amount of snow was made more challenging when four of the town's 12 snow plows broke Monday night due to ""unexpected mechanical issues,"" Gallant said. ""It slows everything down because it takes about five hours to do the town once,"" he said. ""We have 134 miles of road."" The snow was still falling in Winchendon Tuesday morning, making roads that have already been cleared look like they hadn't been touched by a snow plow, Gallant said. The snow plow drivers have been working in rotations around the clock for the past 48 hours, he said. Despite the challenges, Gallant said most Winchendon citizens have been positive and understanding. ""They know it's hard to deal with this much this fast,"" he said. Keith Newton, the superintendent of the Department of Public Works in Royalston, estimated that the town received about 26 inches. He said the most prominent challenge was the moisture content of the snow. The flakes freezed as soon as they hit the ground, creating a thin layer of ice that is dangerous and hard to plow. Newton said receiving this amount of snow is not an unusual event for the town, but the two back-to-back snowfalls on Sunday and Monday night was hard to plan for. ""Because I've been here all my life, no this is not an usual event,"" he said. ""People that live here are really well adjusted to it. They took it in stride."" Nicolas Bosonetto, the commissioner of public works in Fitchburg, was driving a snow plow himself Tuesday morning. He said the town is ""all hands on deck"" to make sure the 220 miles of road in the city remain clear. Many other departments were pitching in to help, using every plow they could find. ""If anything has a plow on it, it's out there,"" he said. Bosonetto said the town has received about 20 inches since 1 p.m. Sunday, and that snow plow drivers have been working nonstop for the past two days. The city was prepared for the foot of snow forecasted to hit Sunday night, but the additional 10 inches over the past day were a bit of a surprise as the forecast only called for three additional inches, Bosonetto said. The fluctuating temperatures in Fitchburg have made plowing the roads even more challenging as the snow melts and re-freezes, Bosonetto said. ""This is a heavy amount for the first snow,"" he said. ""Usually we ease into it."" Duane Pease, the town administrator of Middlefield, also said that the amount of snow from the second wave of the storm caught them a bit by surprise. But, despite getting about 20 inches of snow from the storm, the roads were mostly clear as of early Tuesday afternoon, he said. The town's three-person plowing crew worked overnight Monday to ensure that roads were usable for the morning commute. New Bedford saw around 8 inches of snow as of Tuesday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Police Lieutenant Nathaniel Rodriguez encouraged those driving to make sure to clean the snow and ice off their car before getting on the road. ""That even goes for snow on top of your vehicle,"" he said. ""That can slide down onto your windshield and essentially make you blind and could cause an accident, and ... the wind can take it back onto vehicle behind you.""

"Undersized Marquette star Howard finding ways to dominate  Link to Image Link to Image LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) - Markus Howard continues to find ways to dominate basketball games despite his undersized stature. The 5-foot-11 Marquette preseason All-American and reigning Big East player of the year leads the nation in scoring at 26 points a game. ""We need Markus to be the player and the star he is. It makes everyone better,"" said Golden Eagles coach Steve Wojciechowski. ""He gives us a swagger. He gives us a confidence when he's doing his thing."" He did his thing at Orlando Invitational. Howard scored 91 points on the first two days of the tournament, making a dazzling array of step-back 3-pointers and seemingly blowing past befuddled defenders at will when he chose to drive to the basket for a closer look. He led Marquette to the championship game, where Howard and the Golden Eagles were derailed by third-ranked Maryland. But during their run, Howard became the first Big East player to ever have back-to-back 40-point games, including a 51-point outburst against Southern California in the semifinals. ""Just another incredible performance,"" said Wojciechowski, who watched the senior from Chandler, Arizona go for 40 the previous night against Davidson. Howard was the last player to leave the court after his impressive outing, pausing to pose for pictures before cheerfully plowing through a pack of young Golden Eagles fans chanting his name. It was the third 50-point game of Howard's career. He also joined Mississippi's Johnny Neumann and LSU's Pete Maravich and Bob Pettit as the only players in a major conference to score at least 40 on consecutive days. ""I don't really pay too much attention to that. Whatever comes is truly a blessing,"" Howard said of the milestones. ""I'm so thankful to be in the position I am, having teammates and coaches I have who let me have the freedom to be who I am and comfortable with who I am."" A second-team All-American last season when he led Marquette to the NCAA Tournament, Howard enters Wednesday night's home game against Jacksonville as the nation's top scorer at 26 per game. He was averaging 29.3 before Maryland overwhelmed the Golden Eagles 84-63 in the Orlando Invitational final, limiting Howard to six points on 1 for 12 shooting, including 0 of 6 on 3-point attempts. The Terrapins made a concerted effort to keep the ball out of Howard's hands, a task 6-foot-5 Darryl Morsell took to heart. And when Maryland's best defender wasn't blanketing the Marquette star, 6-foot-6 Aaron Wiggins made things just as difficult for Howard. ""Our goal was just to make it tough,"" Morsell said. ""Contest every shot, just try to get physical."" It wasn't anything out of the ordinary for Howard. Wojciechowski noted Howard has faced nearly every type of defense imaginable during his career. He's been held to single digits seven times over the past two-plus seasons, but he's always bounced back. ""The fact people defend Markus hard is not new. He's Big East player of the year. He's an All-American last year,"" the coach said. ""Teams have gone out to stop him. We have to learn, re-learn with this group, how to figure that out."" Howard has 51 career games of 20-plus points, 20 with 30 or more and six of at least 40. He has no intentions of slowing down as he approaches another milestone he'll share with his brother, Jordan, who played at Central Arkansas from 2015-18 and was Southland Conference player of the year as a senior. As a duo, the Howards have scored 4,661 points. The only other combo of brothers that's scored more is Seth and Stephen Curry, who finished their NCAA careers with 4,736. ""My teammates give me supreme confidence. If they tell me to keep going, I'm going to keep going. I'm never going to stop. That's kind of the mentality I've had as a scorer,"" Howard said. ""No matter what's being thrown at me, I'm going to continue to come at you. Just continue to be aggressive and play with a chip on my shoulder."" Turns out, what's good for Howard is also good for the Golden Eagles, who feed off his energy. ""I think if I don't show that it definitely changes our team a lot,"" Howard said.

"Google co-founders step down as execs of parent Alphabet  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The co-founders of Google are stepping down as executives of its parent company, Alphabet, ending a remarkable two decades during which Larry Page and Sergey Brin shaped a startup born in a Silicon Valley garage into one of the world's largest, most powerful - and, increasingly, most feared - firms in the world. Sundar Pichai, who has been leading Google as CEO for more than four years, will stay in his role and also become CEO of Alphabet. Page was Alphabet's CEO, while Brin was its president. The president's role at Alphabet is not being filled. Both founders promised they plan to stay actively involved as board members and shareholders and lauded Pichai for his leadership of Google. Page and Brin, in announcing the news Tuesday, said the company has ""evolved and matured"" in the two decades since its founding. ""Today, in 2019, if the company was a person, it would be a young adult of 21 and it would be time to leave the roost,"" they said. Alphabet - an umbrella corporation that the two created in 2015 - still boasts Google as its central fixture and key moneymaker. But it's also made up of what are known as ""other bets,"" or longshot projects. That includes drone company Wing and self-driving car firm Waymo. Page and Brin both have been noticeably absent from Google events in the past year. Both stopped making appearances at the weekly question-and-answer sessions with employees, and Page didn't attend this summer's Alphabet shareholders meeting even though he was still in the CEO role. Alphabet has been positioning Pichai as the de facto leader for quite some time - making him the top executive voice at shareholders meetings, on earnings call and as a spokesman at congressional hearings. Pichai, 47, has worked at the company for 15 years, serving as a leader in projects to build the company's Chrome browser and overseeing Android operating system. Pichai, who has an engineering background, took over as the head of Google's products before being promoted to CEO when Alphabet was created. Pichai is known as a soft-spoken and respected manager. Longtime tech analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies said that for all intents and purposes, Pichai has been the public face and the most instrumental person inside Google for the past few years. ""The most interesting question to me - does Sundar as CEO of Alphabet keep the day-to-day role he's had in overseeing all of Google's activities?"" he said. So far, the company has shown no signs that it intends to replace Sundar at Google. But Bajarin said that might make sense, given that Pichai will have so much on his plate as CEO of the overall business, including regulatory pressures from the U.S. and Europe. Google is facing strong pushback from privacy groups, which are concerned about the personal information that Google has collected on its users, mostly to target advertising. Google also faces complaints that it abuses its dominance in search and online advertising to push out rivals. Google is the subject of antitrust inquiries from Congress, the Department of Justice and a contingency of states in the U.S. and from European authorities. The company has also faced harsh criticism about the material on its sites - and was slapped with a $170 million fine because its video streaming site YouTube improperly collected personal data on children without their parents' consent. In the short term, Bajarin doesn't expect much to change at the company. And if anything does, it will be due to government regulation - not the executive shuffle. ""This is kind of a natural flow of the two founders eventually stepping back completely,"" Bajarin said. ""We have seen that over and over in Silicon Valley."" As for Page and Brin, Bajarin added, ""keep in mind, they are not losing their title as billionaires, but they are changing their roles."" Brin and Page still hold more than 50% voting shares of Alphabet. According to a regulatory filing in April, Page holds 42.9% of the company's Class B shares and 26.1% of its voting power. Brin holds 41.3% of the Class B shares and 25.2% of the voting power. Google has nearly doubled its headcount since Pichai took over as chief executive, growing from a company of 59,000 employees to 114,000 now. Google's stock increased less than 1% in after-hours trading after the news was announced. Brin and Page met as Stanford University graduate students in 1995 and started the company soon after. What started as a way to catalog the growing internet has now become one of the most powerful companies in the world. Google dominates online search and digital advertising. It's hard to make it through a whole day without using one of Google's services - ranging from online tools to email, cloud computing systems, phones and smart speaker hardware. Page dropped out of graduate school at Stanford to start Google and doesn't have a business degree. He grew up in Michigan, where his late father, Carl, was a computer scientist and pioneer in artificial intelligence, and his mother taught computer programming. Page began working on personal computers when he was just 6 years old in 1979, when home computers were a rarity. The geeky impulses carried into his adulthood, leading him to once build an inkjet printer out of Legos. ___ AP Technology Writers Mae Anderson in New York and Barbara Ortutay in San Francisco contributed to this story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mass. college basketball teams have more questions than answers right now  What have we learned in November? It looks like this season is going to be a struggle for college basketball teams in Massachusetts. Every team is having problems. Some of it is befuddling, and all the coaches will be challenged. ""   Boston University: Within a week, BU went from what could have been a season highlight, winning at South Carolina, to losing three straight. The first loss, at West Virginia, is excusable, but then the Terriers had an awful, unlucky trip to Cancun, losing to North Colorado and Tennessee Martin. The biggest problem in Cancun was food poisoning suffered by starters Walter Whyte, Javante McCoy, and Alex Vilarino, and substitute Andrew Petcash. The illness affected all of them for the two games in Cancun. Against West Virginia, coach Joe Jones said, he didn't feel his team was ready to put forth the same energetic effort that helped the Terriers win at South Carolina, and they were physically overpowered. FULL TEXT Things got worse in Cancun. ""We were a shell of ourselves the first day,'' said Jones. ""The next day, the guys felt better but - no excuses, we've still got to get it done - I don't think we were at our best.'' Jones sees an area that needs to be improved. ""I know we've got to get tougher,'' he said. ""   Northeastern: Coach Bill Coen said he would know what kind of team he had after the Huskies returned from the Gulf Coast Showcase in Estero, Fla. The results were mixed, with losses to Southern Alabama and Drake and a victory over Weber State. It might be how this season is going to be. The Huskies were missing big man Tomas Murphy (sprained ankle) but that led to playing time for Illinois transfer Greg Eboigbodin. Coen said his play was one of the highlights of the tournament. South Alabama shot very well and held Northeastern's Jordan Roland to 9 points. Drake is decent, but the game was statistically odd. Drake took 20 more shots than the Huskies. So, despite holding Drake to 32 percent shooting overall and 24 percent on threes, it wasn't good enough. NU's 19 turnovers contributed to the 59-56 loss. Against Weber, the Huskies finally found their shooting touch, with Roland scoring 24 in the 79-69 win. ""[The tournament] solidifies what you need to address in order to be successful in conference play,'' said Coen. ""I think we're scoring efficiently, we're shooting at a high level, but we've got to take better care of the basketball. And we've got to become a better rebounding team. ""I think if we address those two areas, that would make a huge impact in how far this team could go.'' It's also becoming obvious that the Huskies need Roland to score every game. Some teams are going to be able to defend him, and that's when things get sticky. ""   Boston College: Jim Christian might have the most difficult problems to solve coming off consecutive losses to DePaul, Saint Louis, and Richmond. Two big problems have cropped up: turnovers and rebounding. There also have been some inexplicable offensive droughts; the shooting has been abysmal. Against Saint Louis, the Eagles were outscored, 33-9, over the first 14 minutes of the second half, plus they gave up 17 offensive rebounds. Against Richmond, they had stretches of 6:22, 4:03, 4:33, and 6:52 in which they scored only one basket. Point guard Derryck Thornton has 33 turnovers against 34 assists. He must have more positive production. Big man Nik Popovich hasn't been assertive enough. ''What's more concerning is the stretch in the second half where it's a 1-point game, 2-point game, and it goes to 15 because we become disconnected,'' said Christian. ''I don't know why for one stretch per night we do that and why the beginning of the game doesn't carry for 40 minutes.'' ""   UMass: After five victories to open the season, there's been a reality check in Amherst. It's a talented group, but the best players are freshmen and it's going to take a while. The Minutemen have lost consecutive games to Virginia, St. John's, and Rutgers. ""We weren't really able to overcome some unforced turnovers,"" said coach Matt McCall after the loss to Rutgers. ""We have to get that corrected because obviously our schedule doesn't get any easier. ""Offensively, I thought we struggled with getting into a rhythm, and you have to give Rutgers credit for that. But this is what we're trying to build towards, to be able to win Big Ten games on the road in a hostile environment. We're not there yet, and we've got a long way to go. But I think a game like this today will prepare us."" ""   Harvard: The Crimson went 1-2 in the Disney World tournament, beating Texas A&M, then losing to Maryland and Southern Cal. Realistically, the Crimson should beat A&M (which finished last in the tournament) and lose to Maryland (which is ranked third in the country and won the tournament). USC was the key game if the Crimson were going to leave Florida feeling good about themselves. It didn't happen, as the Trojans dominated the second half. The Crimson played their best in the losing effort against Maryland. Coach Tommy Amaker has said defense is his team's calling card, and that proved true in Orlando. They haven't solved things offensively and are vulnerable unless Bryce Aiken scores a bunch of points. Aiken also needs to find the proper balance of scoring and playmaking. ""Bryce can score with the best of them,'' said Amaker to reporters in Florida after the A&M victory. ""He had a pretty efficient offensive game, but he can be better than that, certainly in other areas of quarterbacking our team and leading our team.'' This is a team that's still developing, but it always has to be said that the potential is there for great things. ""   Measuring upsets: I think we need a rating of upsets; something along the lines of the Richter Scale. If you just used the traditional 1 through 10, Stephen F. Austin's upset of Duke has to be a 10. The Lumberjacks were the first non-ACC school to win at Cameron Stadium since Feb. 26, 2000, when St. John's did it. Butler is now in possession of the longest nonconference home winning streak at 55. (An aside: Butler's Hinkle Fieldhouse is a sensational place to watch a game.) There was no letdown for Austin, either, as the Lumberjacks won at Arkansas State, 76-57 Saturday. ""   Bruce Pearl can really coach: Auburn's coach is probably more known for his sometimes-outrageous behavior and the sweat stains on his suit, but he is really good at his job. He took Auburn to the Final Four last season, and a dip was expected this season, but it wouldn't be surprising to see the Tigers back in the Final Four. They are 7-0, averaging 85.6 points per game, holding opponents to 66.4, and showing great passion and intensity. Much like their coach. Guard Samir Doughty is the leading scorer, but I really love another guard, J'Von McCormick, who makes things go. I want to see a footrace between him and Kansas's Devon Dotson. ""   Everybody's wrong: Michigan coach Juwan Howard is better than anyone could have imagined. Just about everybody except former members of the Fab Five thought Howard was not a good choice. Obviously it's still early, but his team was sensational in beating Iowa State, North Carolina, and Gonzaga to win the Battle for Atlantis. His early recruiting returns are rated highly too. The Wolverines have another big game Tuesday night at Louisville, the day after the Cardinals ascended to the No. 1 ranking. ""   Perspective in Louisville: The Cardinals are 7-0, as Chris Mack has done a great job. The program could have fallen drastically after the Rick Pitino scandals and the FBI investigation, but it didn't. Mack is keeping a lid on the enthusiasm. ''My job is for me to get them to understand that we haven't arrived,'' Mack told reporters. ""There's no team that's arrived. A lot of people are saying that we haven't played anybody. A lot of people are saying we're not there. Maybe we aren't deserving. I don't care. The only thing I care about is improving."" ""   Revivals: Indiana is 7-0 for the first time since 2012-13 but has played all of its games at home . . . Arkansas is 7-0 under new coach Eric Musselman, the best start since the 1997-98 season, and the Razorbacks have even played one road game . . . Santa Clara is 8-1 for the first time since 1968-69. The Broncos finished 27-2 that season . . . San Diego State is 8-0 for the first time since 2010-11, when it had a player you didn't know then but you know now: Kawhi Leonard. The Aztecs are led by a wild point guard, Malachi Flynn, who can be spectacular and awful all in the same game. He's entertaining and baffling . . . George Mason won the tournament in the Cayman Islands and is 8-1 for the first time since 1983-84. ""   Odd ending: I wrote last season about the unusual inbounds play that Oakland coach Greg Kampe invented and has been adopted by Penn coach Steve Donahue. When inbounding after the other team has scored late in the game and a timeout is called, Kampe has his players line up out of bounds. They then run a play similar to what the Patriots would do with three receivers on one side of the field. Kampe says it's never not worked. Penn has had success too - until this week at the Disneyland tournament. Penn couldn't make a clean pass and the ball deflected off the receiver, giving Central Florida the ball with a chance to tie with a 3-pointer and three seconds left. UCF's Darrin Green hit a shot from the corner that appeared to tie the game. However, the court at Anaheim Arena has four 3-point arcs outlined. Green's foot was inside the college line, and the shot was ruled a two. Penn won, 68-67. ""   Bad losses: Syracuse is an uncharacteristic 4-3 and had a lost weekend in Brooklyn, getting mauled by Penn State, 85-64, and Oklahoma State, 86-72. Coach Jim Boeheim seemed philosophical. ""I thought this team would take a while,'' he told reporters in New York. ""I thought it would take 10 or 12 games. I don't know if it'll be done in 15 or 20 games.'' Sounds promising, right? . . . Georgetown lost at home to UNC Greensboro, 65-61, but there's an asterisk here because Greensboro is one of the top non-power-conference teams in the nation. The Spartans, who should have been given an at-large bid to last season's NCAA Tournament, returned a bunch of good players, notably guard Isaiah Miller. He battled foul trouble against the Hoyas and played only 20 minutes, but the Spartans were still able to win. ""   My preoccupation with uniforms: I really don't like how Long Beach State has discarded yellow as a school color in its black uniforms. I'd like to believe Tark would be outraged . . . Why was Minnesota wearing black at home against DePaul? Makes no sense. I imagine Kevin McHale being unhappy about it . . . The Oregon greens are sensational. I'm not talking about the neon crossing-guard green, I'm talking about the Ducks' traditional bright green. Link to Image Games I'd like to see this week Tuesday Michigan at Louisville: The Wolverines' good feelings from winning in the Bahamas could be gone quickly. Tough to win at the Pitino Palace. Arizona State at San Francisco: Praise for Bobby Hurley for playing this road game. A big opportunity for the Dons, a Sully's Court favorite. Wednesday Georgetown at Oklahoma State: I know the Hoyas just lost to UNC Greensboro, but I see this as an opportunity to see undefeated Okie State against a good opponent. Ohio State at North Carolina: The Buckeyes have been a surprise, and they can get this win in Chapel Hill. Thursday Furman at Auburn: The Paladins are 7-1, and as good as Auburn is, there is an upset possibility. Saturday Arizona at Baylor: A rare road trip for Arizona; both teams are undefeated. Will Chip and Joanna Gaines be at the game? Cincinnati at Xavier: One of the most intense rivalries, and the teams are evenly matched this season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"'Irishman' named best picture by National Board of Review  Link to Image NEW YORK (AP) - Martin Scorsese's sprawling crime epic ""The Irishman"" has been named best picture by the National Board of Review. The awards, announced Tuesday by the National Board of Review, handed Netflix its second major honor in Hollywood's quickening awards season. On Monday evening, Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"" won best feature at the IFP Gotham Awards, which honor independent film. Both movies are widely expected to eventually reap numerous nominations at the Oscars, with either potentially landing Netflix its first best-picture win. ""The Irishman"" also took best adapted screenplay, for Steven Zaillian's script, and an icon award for Scorsese, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. The board, as it typically does, otherwise spread its awards around to help fill its annual gala with stars. Quentin Tarantino took best director for ""Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood."" Best actress went to Renee Zellweger for her performance as Judy Garland in ""Judy."" Adam Sandler won best actor for Josh and Benny Safdie's upcoming New York thriller ""Uncut Gems."" Brad Pitt, widely seen as the Oscar front-runner for his co-leading performance in ""Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,"" won best supporting actor. The National Board of Review also threw its support behind Clint Eastwood's upcoming docudrama on the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing, ""Richard Jewell,"" giving it best supporting actress for Kathy Bates and breakthrough performance for Paul Walter Hauser. The picks by the National Board of Review, a long-running organization comprised of academics and film professionals, have in recent years seldom lined up with eventual Academy Awards winners. But its best-feature choice last year, ""Green Book,"" went on to triumph at the Oscars. Other awards included: best ensemble to Rian Johnson's whodunit ""Knives Out""; best screenplay to ""Uncut Gems""; best documentary to ""Maiden,"" about a historic all-woman sailing crew; best foreign language film to Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite""; best animated film to ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World""; best directorial debut to Melina Matsoukas (""Queen & Slim""); and Roger Deakins (""1917"""") for outstanding achievement in cinematography. The board additionally bestowed its freedom of expression award on both the Death Row drama ""Just Mercy"" and the Syrian war documentary ""For Sama."" The awards will be handed out in a ceremony in New York on January 8, hosted by Willie Geist. ___ Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Minnesota OKs medical cannabis for chronic pain, eye disease  Link to Image ST. PAUL, Minn. - Minnesota is expanding the state's medical marijuana program to include chronic pain and age-related macular degeneration as conditions that can qualify for treatment, state health officials said Monday. FULL TEXT The state Department of Health also said it would allow more sites where patients can access medical cannabis. The changes take effect in August, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Minnesota's medical marijuana program began in 2014. Originally, only nine conditions were on the list, but now it covers such conditions as obstructive sleep apnea, post-traumatic stress disorder, and cancer. Sensible Change Minnesota, a group trying to change marijuana policy in Minnesota, sought the addition of chronic pain. A doctor's diagnosis of chronic pain will be required. It could be easier to certify than intractable pain, which was added to the program a few years ago. Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said the added conditions give more people more ways to deal with debilitating illness. ""The bottom line is that people suffering from these serious conditions may be helped by participating in the program, and we felt it was important to give them the opportunity to seek that relief,"" Malcolm said in a statement. Maren Schroeder, policy director for Sensible Change Minnesota, said doctors have been hesitant to certify intractable pain cases because that carries a specific legal definition by which pain cannot be removed but only managed and other options have failed to achieve results. ""This will give doctors a little more comfort in getting their pain patients into this program as well as helping those patients qualify,"" Schroeder said. Residents petitioned to include the new conditions this summer. Those requests were reviewed by a citizens panel and Health Department staff. Four conditions were rejected: anxiety, insomnia, psoriasis, and traumatic brain injury. As of October, nearly 18,000 patients were certified for the state's medical marijuana program. Minnesota's program is considered relatively restrictive because patients are not allowed to get marijuana in leaf form or ingest it through smoking. Pills, vapors, topical ointments and liquid gels had been the only forms people could obtain through licensed manufacturers. Starting next summer, new delivery methods will include water-soluble cannabinoid, such as powders or sprinkles, and products such as lozenges, gums, mints, and tablets. In addition, LeafLine Labs and Minnesota Medical Solutions - the two licensed manufacturers - will be allowed to open a combined eight more centers in Minnesota. The Health Department said the proposed centers are in Blaine, Burnsville, Duluth, Golden Valley, Mankato, Rogers, Willmar, and Woodbury.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Trump says China deal could wait until after 2020 election  Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image LONDON (AP) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday downplayed the likelihood of reaching a U.S.-China trade deal before next year's elections - and then shrugged off the tailspin that his remarks caused in the stock market. Speaking in London, where he is attending a NATO summit, Trump said he had ""no deadline'' to end the 16-month trade war between the world's two largest economies, which has caused economic damage for both sides. ""In some ways I like the idea of waiting until after the election,"" Trump added. The president has previously suggested that China wanted to wait until after the election to negotiate a deal. Stocks began sinking right after Trump's latest rhetoric shot at the Chinese leadership. His brash remarks could amount to either a short-term negotiating gambit or a sign of his willingness to run for re-election without a breakthrough in the trade war. At midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nearly 400 points. Later Trump dismissed the tumult on Wall Street, choosing instead to highlight how much stock prices have risen since the start of the year. ""We have picked up record numbers in our stock markets, so that's OK. That's the way I feel."" Trump replied to questions from reporters. ""I have to make the right deal. I'm not going to make a deal that's not going to be great for our country. It can't be an even deal. If it's an even deal, it's no good."" The trade negotiations with China, the president declared, are at a ""critical stage."" ""But if the stock market goes up and down, I don't watch the stock market, I watch jobs,"" Trump said, contradicting the numerous tweets he has sent out when stock markets have set new highs. Tensions between the two nations flared anew last week after Trump signed legislation expressing U.S. support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. On Dec. 15, additional U.S. tariffs are set to kick in on many Chinese-made items, including smartphones and toys. The Trump administration is already taxing more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports. China has counterpunched by taxing $120 billion in U.S. imports. Pressure is building on both sides to complete what Trump has called a limited ""Phase 1"" deal before the deadline. Still, Trump could end up postponing the tariffs, as he did in October, to allow more time for negotiations. ___ Kevin Freking and Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Records: Giuliani, Nunes and White House in frequent contact  Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - A new report from Democrats compiling evidence on impeachment has revealed extensive contact between President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the Intelligence panel. The report released Tuesday includes phone records obtained from AT&T and Verizon that show Giuliani also was in frequent contact with the White House and with Lev Parnas, a Giuliani associate who is under indictment on charges of using foreign money to make illegal campaign contributions. Prosecutors said the donations by Parnas and Igor Fruman, another Giuliani associate with Ukraine ties, were made while the men were lobbying U.S. politicians to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Giuliani, who has said he knew nothing about illegal campaign donations, was trying to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump's potential Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. Parnas and Fruman had key roles in Giuliani's quest. The records show that Parnas and Nunes were in frequent contact last April, when Giuliani was publicly calling for an investigation of Biden. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who sparred with Nunes during public impeachment hearings, said he was going to ""reserve comment"" on the Republican's appearance in the report. But he added that, while Trump was ""digging up dirt"" on Biden, ""there may be evidence that there were members of Congress who were complicit in that activity."" Schiff said it may be the role of others to investigate further, but did not elaborate. Joseph Bondy, a lawyer representing Parnas, said on Twitter that Nunes should have recused himself from the impeachment hearings. Parnas has been providing documents to the Intelligence committee in compliance with a subpoena, the report says. Nunes' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The call records also show Giuliani, Nunes and Parnas also were in frequent contact with John Solomon, a former columnist for the Washington news outlet The Hill. Solomon published a series of opinion pieces criticizing former U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch as part of ""a coordinated effort by associates of President Trump to push ... false narratives publicly"" in a bid to force Yovanovitch's ouster, the Democratic report said, citing public statements, phone records, and contractual agreements. After Solomon published an article critical of Yovanovitch on April 7, phone records show numerous calls between Giuliani, Parnas, Nunes and Solomon. For instance, on April 10, Giuliani and Nunes talked on three short calls in rapid succession, followed by a text message, and ending with a nearly 3-minute call. Later that day, Parnas and Solomon had a 4-minute, 39-second call. The report also shows extensive contact between Giuliani and the White House. On April 24, Giuliani had three phone calls with a number associated with the Office of Management and Budget, and eight calls with a White House number. One of Giuliani's calls with the White House was 4 minutes, 53 seconds, and another was 3 minutes, 15 seconds. Later that night, the State Department phoned Yovanovitch and abruptly called her home because of ""concerns"" from ""up the street"" at the White House.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A JFK mistress tells her story - and prompts a question Shouldn't presidential libraries present a fuller truth about their subjects? Link to Image She was a shy, star-struck college student. He was a famous, charismatic, perpetually on-the-make married politician who paid her special attention and then embarked on a secret affair with her. Flattered and smitten, she believed she truly mattered to him. Twice her age and sexually voracious, he was content to let her think so while he dallied with her. Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky? No, John F. Kennedy and Diana de Vegh, then a Radcliffe undergraduate and later a graduate student at Harvard, now an 83-year-old psychotherapist who told her story in Air Mail, Graydon Carter's digital newsweekly. In recounting her story some six decades later, de Vegh is reflecting on both the nature of her youthful delusion and the mores that enabled Kennedy's callous behavior. FULL TEXT ""I think John Kennedy was absolutely a man of his culture, because he didn't just behave in a piggish way with women without the support of no end of other men,"" she said in an interview. With the help of aides and enablers, Kennedy arranged for her to attend his political events and then to come to his Boston apartment, where their sexual relationship commenced. It continued in Washington once he became president. After her story was published, de Vegh told me, four women came up to her at a church service and told her that they had similar stories of sexual exploitation by older, powerful men. Therein lies an opportunity for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. It could break with presidential library boosterism and present a more honest and forthright picture of the 35th president and the political culture then and now. Would de Vegh participate in such an exercise? If its purpose was to say, ""He was a man of his culture, and now let's look at the culture and how it betrayed women and how there were no limits for men,"" then she would. De Vegh acknowledges she doesn't have any pictures of herself with Kennedy, let alone proof of their affair. Still, her account, which she has previously confided to others, fairly closely mirrors that of Mimi Alford, a White House intern Kennedy singled out for special notice - and then determined sexual attentions - when she was 19. It is, of course, hardly headline news that JFK was a serial philanderer or that numerous other politicians are as well. My view is that if public figures have consensual affairs that aren't age exploitative or pursued in ways that use as leverage an imbalance in personal or professional power or involve unwanted comments or physical contact, it's really not a ­­­­­­matter of huge political moment. But Kennedy's affairs with de Vegh and Alford fell well outside those boundaries. Alford was still technically a teenager, de Vegh only 20. Kennedy was in his 40s. In many ways, Kennedy's age-inappropriate dalliances with de Vegh and Alford are similar to Bill Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. There is one big difference, however. Over the quarter-century since Clinton's sexual relationship with Lewinsky, he has been re-contextualized in no small part because of his louche sexual behavior. It is an aspect of his presidency that has led people to realize that for all his talents, Clinton was a lecherous politician who abused his power in relationships with women. But a similar reconsideration hasn't happened with JFK. Part of it is that his assassination froze him in memory in another era. Part of it is that because of his death at 46, Kennedy never had to face questions about his own behavior. And part of it is us: When confronted with troubling information about people we admire, we tend to resolve the cognitive dissonance not by developing a more complex view of that person but rather by wishing away that uncongenial information. Which raises this question: Why don't the presidential libraries of the two men offer a more forthright presentation about that aspect of their conduct? I put that query to both organizations - and received what at first struck me as a semi-thoughtful reply, via statement, from Alan Price, director of the JFK Library: ""The exhibits of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum focus on President Kennedy's public life and his service in office, rather than his private life. As with all of the presidential museums, the primary purpose of our exhibits is to promote an understanding of the presidency and the American experience. However, the Library and Archives branch of our institution is open to historians and researchers for projects that more fully explore the actions and events surrounding the Kennedy presidency, administration, and life."" Until, that is, I got this reply from the Clinton Library. ""The exhibits of the William J. Clinton and the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum focus on President Clinton's and President Kennedy's public life and their service in office, rather than their private lives. As with all of the presidential museums, the primary purpose is to promote an understanding of the presidency and the American experience. However, the Library and Archives branch of all of our institutions are open to historians and researchers for projects that delve deeper into the broader spectrum and events of each President's life beyond the impact of his presidency."" That standard-issue statement, I was advised, should be attributed to the National Archives and Records Administration, which is responsible for the administration of presidential libraries. Translation: Sorry, our partially taxpayer-supported presidential libraries really aren't interested in the whole truth. They prefer to provide a rose-colored journey along a carefully curated path. For her part, de Vegh said one of the most gratifying messages she has received since she told her story was from a friend who said she and her husband had a long conversation with their 23-year-old granddaughter about the way young women are exploited by older, more powerful men. The psychotherapist hopes her candid account will catalyze those kinds of conversations. ""Why are we not preparing young women better for this kind of unequal relationship?"" she asks. ""I think we really need to start taking apart the culture that so undermines young women.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arizona banned school mask mandates. Now some kids are sick and parents are angry  Link to Image Only weeks after Arizona's students went back to school, coronavirus infections are forcing thousands of children and teachers into quarantine. School outbreaks around Phoenix are surging. In one suburban district, so many drivers are sick that school buses are running 90 minutes late. All this in a state that ignored recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and banned school mask mandates weeks before classes resumed. Now the back-to-school turmoil has cascaded far beyond Arizona's classrooms, igniting a political uproar for Gov. Doug Ducey and other Republican leaders in this fast-changing desert battleground. The tumult underscores the perilous decisions facing governors in swing states where voters are divided over COVID-19 safety measures and personal freedoms. Ducey, a business-minded Republican, spent much of the past year getting attacked by conservatives angry about pandemic restrictions and his defense of the 2020 election results. But he has since doubled down on anti-mask-mandate measures passed by Arizona's Republican-run Legislature. FULL TEXT He pledged to withhold millions of dollars in federal pandemic relief from schools that pass mask mandates in defiance of a state law that takes effect at the end of September. He offered $7,000 vouchers to families that opt to leave districts that require face coverings. Masking decisions, he said, belonged to parents, not school officials. ""In Arizona we are pro-parent,"" Ducey said at a recent news conference. ""I want parents to do what they think is the right thing to do."" On the ground, schools say they are facing a no-win choice. In the Phoenix suburb of Chandler, the school board called an emergency meeting in August to decide whether students and staff should be required to wear masks. School officials said violating state law could prevent the district from receiving $11 million to hire staff and help students catch up after so much lost school time. The mask mandate failed, three votes to two. Disheartened Chandler parents who supported the requirements said the board had put money above their children's health. ""They're not protecting our kids,"" said Sandy Kirby, a Chandler parent and nurse. But Kelli Wilson, a devoted Trump voter in Chandler whose 13-year-old son is unvaccinated and does not wear a mask to school, was gratified. Wilson, who had soured on Ducey when the gym she runs was forced to close down early in the pandemic, credited the governor with letting parents decide about masks. ""Finally Doug Ducey's doing something right,"" she said. Ducey had kept a lower profile throughout much of the pandemic compared with the Republican governors of Florida, South Dakota and Texas, who built national reputations as combative opponents of COVID restrictions. But as he looks to his political future after he leaves office next year because of term limits, Ducey is moving to the front of the volatile new battle over personal freedoms, children's health and the politicization of pandemic relief money. Education groups have sued to overturn the mask-mandate ban, and more than a dozen school districts across Arizona have passed mask mandates despite the ban. The Biden administration warned governors like Ducey and Ron DeSantis of Florida not to block federal money from pro-masking schools. The conflict is unfolding in a onetime Republican stronghold now torn in opposite directions, pulled to the left by growing numbers of young, college-educated voters and moderates in the booming Phoenix suburbs, and to the right by vocal Trump loyalists. With virus hospitalizations climbing to about 2,000 people from about 520 in early July, many parents, teachers' unions and public health officials said Ducey's actions punished schools that were following scientific advice. The CDC recommends masks for all students, staff and visitors inside schools. ""It puts people's lives at risk,"" said Jann-Michael Greenburg, president of the Scottsdale Unified School District, which has faced threats since passing a temporary mask mandate. ""I wonder if we would have won the battle against polio if this is how our governments behaved."" Ducey, a vocal supporter of vaccinations, has been battered from several sides throughout the pandemic. Democrats criticized him for not imposing a statewide mask mandate and loosening restrictions prematurely. Many of the loudest attacks, however, have come from the right wing of Arizona's splintered Republican Party. In January, the state party censured him for taking emergency actions such as closing gyms and bars at the outset of the pandemic. Ducey has also endured months of attacks from his Republican base in the wake of the 2020 election. Ducey had campaigned for President Donald Trump but declined to embrace Trump's false claims about a rigged election. He certified President Joe Biden's 10,500-vote victory in Arizona but has kept largely quiet as a polarizing audit of the votes ordered by state Republican leaders drags on. Some political observers saw Ducey's moves against mask mandates as an effort to patch a rift with conservatives. ""He's trying to court that constituency to move back,"" said Chuck Coughlin, a Republican political strategist in Phoenix. ""He's never going to recover with them. He can't. Once Trump starts tweeting about you in a derogatory sense, the gloves are off."" Ducey is chairman of the Republican Governors Association and often mentioned as a potential candidate for president, vice president or U.S. Senate. He has said he is focused on his job and is not challenging Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat up for reelection in 2022. Last month, just after he wrapped up a solemn bill-signing ceremony in front of Holocaust survivors, Ducey held a rare news conference and faced a barrage of questions about the anti-mask measures. He quickly pivoted to criticize Biden's handling of the coronavirus and a range of other issues as ""weak and pathetic"" and told the administration to butt out of Arizona's mask debates. ""Why don't they focus on their day job?"" Ducey asked, his voice rising, as masked reporters crowded around him. ""Take care of the nation's borders, and help Americans leave Afghanistan, and leave the schools to the states."" The clamor over masking has been fierce in Arizona, where thousands of redshirted teachers poured into the streets in Phoenix three years ago to demand better salaries and school funding. Last year, Arizona let local governments write their own mask rules. But this summer, the state Legislature added a provision outlawing school mask mandates to a tax-cutting budget bill central to Ducey's agenda. The governor signed the measure into law in late June. Arizona's huge and politically powerful public colleges and universities, which are not bound by the same rules that restrict local schools, have passed their own mask mandates in a potential challenge to the state. Arizona State University announced mask requirements in classrooms and labs, and the University of Arizona is requiring masks indoors where people cannot socially distance. Kathy Hoffman, superintendent of Arizona's public schools, said the barrage of executive orders and legal fights had been ""demoralizing"" to school employees. While Arizona has not seen nearly as severe a spike as Florida or Texas, health officials in Phoenix recently warned that children under 12 - who are not eligible to be vaccinated - make up one-sixth of Maricopa County's COVID-19 cases, and that hospitalizations of children have doubled monthly. ""People are feeing pretty devastated right now,"" said Hoffman, an elected Democrat. Some Republicans want even harsher penalties for defiant schools. ""They should lose as much funding as the state Legislature allocates to them,"" said state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, a Republican who is running to replace Arizona's Democratic secretary of state. ""What they are doing, the chaos they're causing, is not only reckless but dangerous."" It is a charge that pro-mask school board members throw back at Arizona leaders. Lindsay Love, a Chandler school board member, said she had received death threats and been called racist slurs throughout the pandemic. She worried that the state's threats of withholding money from districts that impose mandates could have dangerous new consequences. The state says ""the health of our students doesn't matter as much as those dollars,"" Love said. ""How much is a student worth to us if they die of COVID?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"McCarthy warns companies not to comply with Jan. 6 panel's request  Link to Image WASHINGTON - House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, is threatening telecommunications and social media companies that comply with a request by the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, declaring that Republicans ""will not forget"" their actions. McCarthy spoke with former president Donald Trump on the day of the attack and is a potential witness in the select committee's probe. His statement comes after the panel on Monday asked 35 companies to retain phone records and other information related to the attack as it ramps up its investigation ahead of the return of Congress next month. FULL TEXT ""Adam Schiff, Bennie Thompson, and Nancy Pelosi's attempts to strong-arm private companies to turn over individuals' private data would put every American with a phone or computer in the crosshairs of a surveillance state run by Democrat politicians,"" McCarthy said in a statement Tuesday night, referring to the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, the chairman of the select committee, and the House speaker. ""If these companies comply with the Democrat order to turn over private information, they are in violation of federal law and subject to losing their ability to operate in the United States,"" McCarthy said. ""If companies still choose to violate federal law, a Republican majority will not forget and will stand with Americans to hold them fully accountable under the law."" Tim Mulvey, a spokesman for the select committee, said Wednesday that the panel ""won't be deterred by those who want to whitewash or cover up the events of January 6th, or obstruct our investigation."" ''The Select Committee is investigating the violent attack on the Capitol and attempt to overturn the results of last year's election,'' Mulvey said in a statement. ''We've asked companies not to destroy records that may help answer questions for the American people.'' Pelosi in June announced the formation of a select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, after Senate Republicans blocked an effort to form an independent, bipartisan commission. McCarthy opposed both the bipartisan commission and the select committee. The panel is charged with investigating the facts and causes of the insurrection and will provide recommendations to help prevent similar attacks in the future. The select committee's chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, recently said his panel would not shy away from investigating lawmakers as part of its inquiry, highlighting the remarkable nature of Congress investigating an attack on itself. The committee's plans have already drawn criticism from Republicans, most of whom have opposed investigating the insurrection and Trump's role in inspiring the mob with his false claims about Joe Biden's win in the 2020 election. The request that went out Monday was sent to tech and social media companies including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and Signal, as well as telecommunications companies such as Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile. The panel is asking the 35 companies to preserve ''metadata, subscriber information, technical usage information, and content of communications for the listed individuals.'' Washington Post Okla. lawmaker reportedly threatened ambassador, staff The call to the US ambassador to Tajikistan came in Monday. On the line, two US officials said, was Representative Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma, with an unusual and urgent request: He needed assistance in transporting a huge amount of cash into the country, saying he was going to neighboring Afghanistan to rescue five American citizens, a woman and her four children, stuck in the country. They planned to hire a helicopter for the effort. Mullin told the embassy that he planned to fly from Tblisi, Georgia, into Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, in the next few hours and needed the top diplomat's help, according to the two US officials familiar with the incident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private conversations about a sensitive matter. The answer was no. Embassy officials told Mullin they could not assist him in skirting Tajikistan's laws on cash limits on his way to visiting one of the most dangerous places on Earth. Mullin was outraged by the response, the officials said - threatening US Ambassador John Mark Pommersheim and embassy staff and demanding to know the name of staff members he was speaking with. The episode marked Mullin's second attempt to travel to Afghanistan in as many weeks for an unauthorized evacuation effort despite the perilous security environment. Last week, Mullin traveled to Greece and asked the Department of Defense for permission to visit Kabul. The Pentagon denied Mullin's request, an administration official said. Mullin's behavior has alarmed top US officials who say he has gone to extraordinary lengths to defy US warnings. The attempt follows an unauthorized trip to Afghanistan by Representatives Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Peter Meijer, Republican of Michigan, last week, which Pentagon and State Department officials criticized as a public relations stunt that sapped government resources during a national security crisis. As of late Tuesday, US officials said they were unsure of Mullin's location. ''To say this is extremely dangerous is a massive understatement,'' said a State Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive situation. Mullin's office did not respond to multiple requests for comment before this story published. After it published, Meredith Blanford, a spokeswoman for Mullin, put out a statement saying that Mullin ''has been and is currently completely safe"" and that he and his office ''will continue to do anything in our power to bring home all Americans from the war zone that President Biden abandoned.'' The statement said the office had no further comment. On Wednesday morning, Mullin posted a photo of himself on Instagram saying he was ''heading home"" without specifying where he was. Washington Post GOP Senator acknowledges Trump loss in Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, one of former president Donald Trump's staunchest congressional allies who has supported an audit of the election results in Wisconsin, acknowledged that the only reason Trump lost the state to President Biden was because he underperformed compared to other Republicans, according to a video released Tuesday. Speaking at a GOP event outside Milwaukee on Sunday, Johnson was asked by a liberal activist who posed as a conservative about the false and debunked belief that Biden won the election due to voter fraud. Instead of supporting the activist's false theory, Johnson pointed to a different explanation for Trump's defeat in Wisconsin: Republicans, as a whole, received more votes in races for other statewide offices than the former president. ''There's nothing obviously skewed about the results,'' Johnson said, according to a video posted by liberal activist Lauren Windsor. ''If all the Republicans voted for Trump the way they voted for the Assembly candidates, he would have won. He didn't get 51,000 votes that other Republicans got, and that's why he lost.'' Biden won Wisconsin by nearly 21,000 votes, flipping a state Trump won in 2016 by about the same margin. The president's win has been repeatedly reaffirmed through recounts and court rulings, and lawsuits from Trump allies and Republicans challenging Biden's victory were defeated time and time again.

"With low numbers, defending South Shore champion Carver will not field a varsity boys' soccer team  Link to Image The Carver boys' soccer team capped an 8-3-1 season last November with a 5-1 victory over Randolph in the South Shore League championship game. The roster was heavy on seniors, headlined by four-year stalwarts Dominic Craig and Mike Sawicki, a two-time Globe All-Scholastic. FULL TEXT Realizing that numbers might be an issue, Carver athletic director Phyllis Bowie opened team registration in June to prompt action. By last week, however, with the start of MIAA preseason workouts, there was concern. Only seven players, including no rising seniors, had registered. On Thursday, Bowie made the difficult decision to cancel the varsity season and reached out to the other ADs in the South Shore League to remove the Crusaders from their schedule. Carver will now try to field a junior varsity team to keep the program alive. ""We graduated 10-11 seniors; obviously that played a role,"" said Bowie, who called the development a little bit surprising. ""And that is why we started registration early. You figure a few kids would [sign up] last minute. But by last Thursday, we had to take a serious look at the program, and we had to consider the rest of the league too."" Registration remains open and Bowie is hopeful that with the first day for school scheduled for Tuesday, ""We can get the word out, and see what we can do as far as recruiting. At this point, we are trying to rebuild the program."" The girls' soccer program, according to Bowie, had 25 candidates try out, and the football roster numbers between 45-50. Sawicki and Craig each capped their stellar four-year careers with 100-plus points, second and third, respectively, on the program's career point list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Biden meets Ukraine leader in long-sought Oval Office visit  Link to Image WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden used his first meeting with a foreign leader since ending the war in Afghanistan to send the message Wednesday that the United States - unburdened of its ""forever war"" - is determined to become a more reliable ally to its friends, in this case Ukraine. Biden played host to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a long-sought Oval Office meeting and tried to reassure him that his administration remains squarely behind the Eastern European nation. FULL TEXT Biden didn't mention Afghanistan in his brief appearance with Zelensky before cameras. But he highlighted his concerns about Russian aggression in the region. Biden, in making his case to end the war in Afghanistan, repeatedly said winding down the 20-year conflict would allow the US to put greater focus on combating malevolent acts from adversaries Russia and China. ""The United States remains firmly committed to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russian aggression and for Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic aspirations,"" Biden said. The Ukrainian leader, who had found himself ensnarled in Donald Trump's first impeachment, arrived at the White House looking to Biden for increased military aid and backing for his country's bid for NATO membership. The meeting was postponed two days while Biden and his national security team were consumed by the American military withdrawal from Afghanistan. The withdrawal, which concluded Monday, left behind many Afghans who had worked with the Americans and their allies and who now fear Taliban rule. This led to criticism that the US was less than a reliable international partner, something Biden was eager to counter. The optics of the moment did not go unnoticed by the Ukrainian president, who is looking to strengthen his country's relationship with the US. ""At a difficult time for the world and the United States ... still you found time for us and we're thankful for this indeed,"" Zelensky said. In advance of the sit-down, the Biden administration said it was committing up to $60 million in new military aid to Ukraine. The administration said in a notification to Congress that the aid package for Ukraine was necessary because of a ""major increase in Russian military activity along its border"" and because of mortar attacks, cease-fire violations, and other provocations. Zelensky thanked Biden for the aid. ""The war in Donbas is in its eighth year, and we have lost 15,000 people,"" Zelensky said in a reference to the conflict with Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. In their private talks, Zelensky was expected to bring up Washington's decision not to block the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would carry Russian natural gas directly to Germany, bypassing Ukraine. The pipeline is vehemently opposed by Ukraine and Poland as well as both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, with Zelensky describing it as a powerful geopolitical weapon for Russia. Zelensky, a television actor new to politics, took office in May 2019 anxious to firm up his country's relationship with the United States. Instead, he almost immediately found himself under pressure from Trump envoys and soon Trump himself, who in the phone call that led to his first impeachment asked Zelensky to ""do us a favor."" In that now famous July 2019 call, Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Trump's European Union envoy, Gordon Sondland, later told impeachment investigators that Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani explicitly sought a ""quid pro quo"" in which an Oval Office visit would be contingent on Zelensky announcing the politically charged investigation Trump wanted. ""Was there a 'quid pro quo?'"" Sondland asked. ""With regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes."" Besides the coveted invitation to the White House, Sondland also said it was his understanding that Trump was holding up nearly $400 million in military aid until Ukraine announced the investigation. Allegations that Trump withheld congressionally approved military aid while seeking Ukraine's help for his reelection campaign formed the basis of the the first impeachment case against him. Trump was acquitted by the Senate. The Oval Office meeting with Zelensky never happened. With Biden, Zelensky now has a president with a long history of involvement in Ukraine, one who has supported its determination to break free from Russia, shore up its young democracy, and be more fully welcomed into the Western club. As vice president, Biden was the Obama administration's point person on Ukraine and pushed for tougher action against corruption. He once boasted of his success in getting Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who had blocked some corruption investigations. Trump later twisted this by insisting, wrongly, that Biden had done so to protect his son and the energy company on whose board he served. Zelensky is the latest Ukrainian president to promise to tackle systemic corruption and then struggle once in office. On Wednesday, Biden wanted assurances that Zelensky remains committed to following through on various reforms, a senior US administration official said. Zelensky was looking for greater economic and military assistance. And he has said he wanted a clear statement from Biden on whether he supports eventual NATO membership for Ukraine. NATO members are wary given Ukraine's simmering conflict with Russia. The $60 million security package will include more Javelin anti-tank missiles, which Kyiv sees as critical to defending against the Russia-backed separatists who have rolled through eastern Ukraine. The US has overall committed more than $400 million in military aid this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rebellion, an alternative to Hollywood filmmaking that emerged out of the University of California at Los Angeles, where Black directors such as Charles Burnett, Julie Dash, and Billy Woodberry trained in the 1970s and '80s. FULL TEXT ""Every scene she was in, she brought it to life,"" said Burnett, who worked with Ms. Moore in ""Killer of Sheep"" (completed in 1977) and ""Bless Their Little Hearts"" (1983). In a phone interview, he lamented that Ms. Moore ""didn't get the opportunity to display her talent"" in more films, adding, ""It's a sad observation about America and how we treat people of color. She definitely could have had her own TV show, could have been that successful."" Ms. Moore fell into acting after moving from Kansas City to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, where she worked for the cosmetics line Max Factor and then joined a theater workshop. ""She was having a really difficult time while living in Los Angeles, some mental health difficulties,"" said Samantha Sheppard, a Cornell University film scholar who interviewed her in 2018. ""She felt that acting had saved her life."" While performing in student plays and movies, she met Burnett, a UCLA graduate student who cast her in his thesis project, ""Killer of Sheep,"" a low-budget meditation on Black life in the Watts section of Los Angeles, where he had grown up. Shot in black-and-white for $10,000, the film starred Henry G. Sanders as Stan, a slaughterhouse worker and father of two, and Ms. Moore as the unnamed matriarch struggling to keep their family together. The film was never intended for wide release. But with its poetic shots of children leaping between rooftops, and of Ms. Moore and Sanders dancing languorously to Dinah Washington's ""This Bitter Earth,"" it acquired a reputation as an independent classic. It was one of the first 50 movies inducted into the Library of Congress's National Film Registry, and was hailed by New York Times movie critic Manohla Dargis as ""an American masterpiece, independent to the bone,"" after it was restored and opened in theaters in 2007. Six years after it was first completed, Ms. Moore had a more substantial role as the overworked wife and mother Andais Banks in ""Bless Their Little Hearts,"" which was directed by Woodberry and written and shot by Burnett. Like ""Killer of Sheep,"" the film was centered on a working-class family in Watts, with Nate Hardman cast as Ms. Moore's unemployed husband, Charlie, who starts an affair. After Andais learns that he is funneling money to the other woman, she unleashes her anger in a 10-minute fight sequence - ""one of the great domestic cataclysms of modern movies,"" wrote New Yorker film critic Richard Brody - in which both spouses vent their anger in the kitchen. Filmed in a single uninterrupted take, the scene was ad-libbed and drawn in part from real life. As Ms. Moore told it, she had asked the filmmakers to leave a kitchen table in the scene as a way to create distance between her and Hardman, who had previously frightened her while lifting her out of her shoes during a stage play they appeared in together. But when she arrived to shoot the scene, the table was gone. ""I was panicked, afraid, and downright scared to death, and it was no act,"" the distribution company Milestone Film and Video quoted her as saying in a 2017 interview. ""It was taking me back to my late teens when a man who was supposed to love me would beat me for nothing. . . . I got it through my mind that this was a setup, and they did this so that Nate would hurt me and they could get it on film. Nate did hurt me, and they let him. ""But my best acting was after the scene had been shot,"" she continued. When it was over, she said, ""I did not let those three men (Charles, Billy, and Nate) know how I really felt. . . . I never brought the matter up again."" ""Bless Their Little Hearts"" was inducted into the National Film Registry, along with Ms. Moore's follow-up, ""Daughters of the Dust"" (1991), in which she appeared as a strong-willed woman who has married into a Gullah family in the early 20th century. Directed by Dash, the movie is generally considered the first feature made by a Black woman to get a wide release, and it was credited with inspiring some of the sumptuous imagery in Beyoncé's 2016 film ""Lemonade."" ""We all left the set knowing that we were putting together something pretty special,"" Ms. Moore told the Kansas City Star in 1992. ""Most Black films are stereotypical. You're a criminal, a prostitute or a seller of drugs. The films are about sex and violence. Blacks are victims; if it's a historic story, they're cotton pickers. ""But this,"" she continued, ""is a love story about a family."" Kaycee Collier was born in Kansas City, Kan., on Feb. 24, 1944. Two of her brothers reportedly died of sickle cell anemia, an inherited blood disorder, and her mother later worked to promote research and health services for people with the condition, founding a Kansas City chapter of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America. In 1984, Ms. Moore returned to Kansas City to help her ailing mother run the organization. By the time her mother died in 1990, Ms. Moore had succeeded her as executive director, a position she held for the next eight years. ""The sickle cell thing is not a career choice,"" she told the Salina (Kan.) Journal in 1993. ""I came back to help my mother and she died, and people from the city and state said, 'What are you going to do?' "" In time, she embraced the job, organizing charity concerts to raise money for research into the disease. ""I have pawned my jewelry to help keep our doors open,"" she later told the Star. A state legislator, Mary Groves Bland, credited Ms. Moore and her mother with helping to institute sickle-cell testing of all infants born in Missouri. Ms. Moore was married twice, to John Moore Jr. and Stephen Jones, who predeceased her. Survivors include two children, John Moore III and Michelle Swinton; four siblings; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. In recent years, Ms. Moore had been working on a screenplay, a historical drama set in the Kansas City area. She made her last film appearance in ""Ninth Street"" (1999), based on a play by Kevin Willmott, in which she starred alongside Isaac Hayes and Martin Sheen as a ""bag lady"" traumatized by her son's death in the Vietnam War. She said she had initially turned down a request to appear in the movie, which was filmed in Kansas City. ""Then I happened by the set with my husband, saw all the hustle . . . and the bug just bit me again,"" she told the Star. ""I said, 'I've got to do this even if it never makes a nickel, even if nobody ever sees it.' ""There were times when I had to change costumes at 23rd and Vine, right out in the street,"" she added. ""No dressing room, no privacy. That's one of the things about loving acting - you lose a lot of your shame.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Saints opener vs. Packers moved from New Orleans to Jacksonville after Ida  Link to Image The New Orleans Saints will play their season opener in Jacksonville, Fla., after being displaced by Hurricane Ida. Instead of playing in the Superdome for the Sept. 12 opener against the Green Bay Packers, the Saints will host the game at the home of the Jaguars, the NFL announced Wednesday. While the Superdome appears to have been spared significant damage from the powerful Category 4 hurricane, there are logistical challenges with staffing an NFL game there  because of the widespread damage in the New Orleans area. FULL TEXT ""I am proud of the collective communications that occurred between many entities in a short amount of time that led to us making this decision,"" said Saints owner Gayle Benson. ""It is never easy to make a decision that involves not playing a Saints home game in the Caesars Superdome, but I am confident that this is the right decision for our city at this juncture."" General manager Mickey Loomis said the Saints expect to play a lot of home games at the Superdome this season. After the opener, the Saints have road games at Carolina and the Patriots before their next scheduled home game Oct. 3 against the New York Giants. Two more road games and their bye week follow before they host defending Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay on Oct. 31. The Saints evacuated New Orleans before the storm and went to North Texas; they have practiced this week at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. They are remaining in Texas for workouts next week, and will travel to Jacksonville the day before the season opener. ""We've got a firm plan for the next week of preparation. ... We've got a place to practice and a place to stay for our team,"" Loomis said. ""I don't think there's anything really too unique about playing on the road if we have to do this Week 1, because we're going to do that Week 2 and Week 3. So it'll be a normal road trip, it's just departing from here."" The arrival of Ida came 16 years to the day after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. The Saints were forced to move for the entire 2005 season, setting up operations in San Antonio while playing home games there and in Baton Rouge at LSU. New Orleans also played one ""home"" game at Giants Stadium while going 3-13 that season. Spurred on by the quick restoration of the Superdome, the Saints went 10-6 and won the NFC South in 2006, Sean Payton's first season at coach. ""Collectively, we have a monumental task ahead of us in cleaning up the after effects left by Hurricane Ida, but it has been inspiring to see people getting right to work and starting the process,"" Benson said, also thanking the Jaguars staff and their city leaders in offering to host our game. Saints season ticket-holders will have access to tickets for the opener before they go on sale to the general public. Steelers place Stephon Tuitt on IR The Pittsburgh Steelers believe they have plenty of depth along the defensive line. It will be tested after the team placed veteran defensive end Stephon Tuitt on the injured reserve/return list. Defensive coordinator Keith Butler said  that Tuitt is dealing with a knee injury but did not get into specifics about the severity of the issue. Butler did confirm it's one of the reasons why Tuitt did not practice with the team at all during training camp. ""His knee is bothering him, as far as I know,"" Butler said. ""I don't know everything about his knee, I just know it's slowing him down right now."" While Steelers coach Mike Tomlin has insisted that the 28-year-old Tuitt - who is coming off a career-best 11 sacks in 2020 - is ""fine,"" he is also helping his mother grieve the loss of his younger brother. Richard Bartlett III, 23, died after being struck in a hit-and-run accident in Georgia in June. ""To tell you the truth, I don't know how I'd handle my mom watching her son die,"" Butler said. ""I don't know if I could handle that. So, I'm not sure what to tell you, other than that his knee is bothering him a little bit and he might be a little bit overweight and what he's doing with his mother."" Butler added he believes the Steelers will get Tuitt back, but declined to offer a guess on when that might be. Under NFL rules, the earliest Tuitt will be able to practice with the rest of the team is in three weeks. The Steelers prepared for Tuitt's loss by keeping eight defensive linemen when rosters were trimmed to 53 on Tuesday, including rookie Isaiahh Loudermilk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rick Canavan's debut album marks a farewell to comedy  Link to Image Rick Canavan had roughly 18 years of material to choose from for his debut album, ""Who Am I?"" He approached his setlist as a ""best of,"" combing through jokes he'd been honing in local clubs for years. This would normally be the time when a comedian would be out promoting his new work on every stage he could find. But once the album drops Friday, Canavan isn't sure he'll ever get onstage again. Canavan was already disenchanted with stand-up before the pandemic. But when comedy clubs shut down as COVID-19 started to spread, it gave him an excuse to stop. ""As soon as I heard that [the virus] was airborne, I was not even thinking of getting in front of people again,"" he says, speaking by Zoom. FULL TEXT Once comedy was gone, Canavan found he didn't miss it. He's maintained his longtime job working the late shift for an answering service, and he's taken up cooking. If he were to get back onstage now, he's not sure what he'd have to say. Material about the ever-present pandemic makes him cringe. ""My viewpoint is pretty different on things now,"" he says. ""I can't imagine going to a place and doing the act that I've worked on for 20 years. But I also can't imagine going to a place and talking about what's going on right now either. I don't think I'm the guy."" A lot of material on the album is observational, about things Canavan would now call ""trivial."" On one track, he talks about his family's favorite restaurant, the 99. ""Until I'd been there, I didn't know you could burn a salad,"" he says. His wife once asked if he would take a bullet for her, he says in another bit. ""I know that you're supposed to say yes. I said, 'Why?'"" he says. ""You know a lot of dangerous criminals that only can afford one bullet?"" Link to Image There is nothing wrong with dealing in trivial subjects. That's the stock in trade of popular comics from Jerry Seinfeld to Kathleen Madigan. But after the turmoil of recent months, that brand of stand-up doesn't interest Canavan. ""I'm trying to become smarter,"" he says. ""[I've been] trying to be a more well-rounded person for the last year and a half."" Canavan's comedy career has a familiar origin story. He did some sketch comedy in high school and found his way to open mics a short time later. People laughed, and he was hooked. It felt like he was on the cusp of something, getting more and more involved in the Boston scene. ""I think I let go of that probably about 10 years ago,"" he says. Now Canavan is happy just making his friends laugh. ""I have found that I am maybe the most creative and most funny just messaging my friends on text,"" he says, ""and it really fills a creative hole for me."" Shawn Carter is one of those friends. He now runs a club in Bristol, Tenn., but was running Maggie's Lounge in Quincy in 2019 when he booked Canavan for a night to record the album. He confirms that Canavan hasn't lost his comic instincts. ""He's got to be the person that I talk to the most through text messages,"" he says. ""I might be telling him something that is bothering me and he will not stop joking. And then that becomes the thing that's bothering me."" It was Carter who convinced Canavan to record the album. (Canavan mentions on one track that he did it on a dare.) He's happy the album is finally coming out, but he also understands his friend's decision to walk away. ""Maybe there has to be something missing from your life to want to keep doing comedy,"" he says. ""And I feel like Rick's got things set up pretty good right now. And maybe he's just happy."" Canavan wonders if he was perhaps too dedicated to comedy before the pandemic. The subtitle of the album is ""A night of comedy when my mom like, JUST died."" He never addresses the subject on the album, but his mother had died two days before the recording. It would have been easy to postpone it, but he'd been conditioned to the idea that comics don't cancel shows and went through with the recording. ""I still did the recording, which is like a whole 'nother reason why I'm so glad to be out,"" he says. ""Because I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have felt like I had to do it. The day she died I went to do a show that night, because I had to get ready for this album recording."" Canavan isn't promising he'll never step foot onstage again. He just can't imagine what would make him want to perform again. And if he never does, he's glad he has this album as a souvenir. ""I feel good about the time that I put into this and this being the output of that time,"" he says. ""There are things about comedy that are frustrating, and that I'm glad I don't have to deal with anymore. But the fact that I wrote these things, and I have this to put out, I'm really proud.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When might COVID-19 vaccines be cleared for children younger than 12?  Link to Image As COVID-19 infections continue to rise across the population due to the highly transmissible Delta variant and children begin to return to school, many parents are asking the same question: When will my child be able to get vaccinated? Moderna and Pfizer launched clinical trials of the vaccines for children younger than 12 earlier this year. The data will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for officials to review before granting emergency use clearance in the younger age group. FULL TEXT Here's what we know about when the vaccines might be approved for children younger than 12. Where do the vaccine trials stand? Pfizer and Moderna both launched clinical trials for their vaccines in children younger than 12 in March. Pfizer's vaccine, which last week received full approval from the FDA for people 16 and older, is the only vaccine that has been approved for children between the ages of 12 and 15. Vaccines developed by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have received emergency authorization for use in people 18 and older. In late July, the FDA asked Pfizer and Moderna to increase the number of children enrolled in the clinical trials in an effort to learn more about rare side effects as a result of the vaccine. When might the vaccines be approved for children ages 5 to 11? A number of federal health officials have suggested recently that vaccines could be authorized in children ages 5 to 11 before the end of the year. In an interview with NPR last week, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said both Pfizer and Moderna haven't submitted their clinical trial data to the Food and Drug Administration yet. Collins said he doesn't think approval for vaccines in kids ages 5 to 11 will be granted ""much before the end of 2021."" Collins described some of the specific questions officials will need to address, including what dose younger children would receive compared to adults. ""I know a lot of people are really anxious to see this move forward,"" Collins said. ""It's a difficult situation because kids under 12 are not just little miniature human beings. They have differences in their metabolism, their immune system, so for instance the question: What's the dose you ought to give? Do you give the same dose to a 6 year old as you would to somebody who's 30? Probably you need to look at that."" He also provided an estimate of when he thinks the FDA will see clinical trial data. ""Pfizer thinks maybe by the end of September they'll be ready to send in their trial data and then FDA will have to review it,"" Collins said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, was asked on The Today Show last week if a COVID-19 vaccine for children younger than 12 might be approved before the December holidays. ""I think there's a reasonable chance that that'll be the case,"" Fauci replied, adding that Pfizer and Moderna are now collecting data on the safety of the vaccines, the correct dose, and the ability of the vaccines to generate an immune response. . ""That data ultimately will be presented to the FDA to look at it for the balance between safety and risk benefit ratio for the children,"" Fauci said. ""I hope all of that process will take place expeditiously and that we will have it on the time table that you just mentioned, hopefully by the mid-late fall and early winter."" Pressure is mounting for officials to give the vaccines approval for younger children As children are returning to school and infections rise generally across the population due to the highly infectious Delta variant, pressure is mounting on the FDA to authorize a vaccine for the younger age group. In a Twitter thread on Monday night, Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University's School of Public Health, said the case fatality rate in the United States, or the measure of how many cases lead to deaths, has fallen by 50 percent in the past six weeks. However, that metric has been driven by increasing infections among children 5 to 11, Jha said. Jha said the rate of infections among 5 to 11 year old children is increasing, now outpacing older age groups. Children are much less likely to be hospitalized and die of COVID-19 than adults, which explains why even as infection rates increase, the country's case fatality rate is dropping. But the fact that children, particularly those ages 5 to 11, are getting infected with the virus at higher rates raises the urgency of vaccinating the group, Jha wrote. ""I know [the] FDA [is] being very careful about making sure vaccines are safe in kids 5-11,"" Jha wrote. ""Good. But there is a cost to waiting until every box is checked. Young kids [are] getting infected at very high rates [and] need the protection of vaccines."" In a letter earlier this month to FDA acting commissioner Janet Woodcock, Representatives Ro Khanna and Katie Porter of California requested a briefing on the status of emergency approval on vaccines for children ages 2 to 11. Dozens of members of Congress, including Representatives Jake Auchincloss, Ayanna Pressley, and Lori Trahan of Massachusetts, cosigned the letter. ""As transmission rates increase and schools reopen for in-person instruction, parents need to know when their kids will be able to get vaccinated,"" the letter stated. The American Academy of Pediatrics also wrote to Woodcock last month urging the agency to ""continue working aggressively towards authorizing safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for children under age 12 as soon as possible."" The letter noted that pediatricians and families have been waiting for a vaccine for children under 12, especially with the rise of the Delta variant, which ""has created a new and pressing risk to children and adolescents across this country, as it has also done for unvaccinated adults."" ""In our view, the rise of the Delta variant changes the risk-benefit analysis for authorizing vaccines in children,"" the letter stated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Officers, paramedics charged in Elijah McClain's 2019 death  Link to Image DENVER - Three suburban Denver police officers and two paramedics were indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the death of Elijah McClain, a Black man who was put in a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative two years ago, Colorado's attorney general said Wednesday. The 23-year-old's death gained widespread attention during last year's protests against racial injustice and police brutality following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. FULL TEXT McClain's pleading words captured on police body camera video - ""I'm just different"" - were posted on signs at protests and spoken by celebrities who joined those calling for the prosecution of the officers who stopped McClain as he walked down the street in the city of Aurora after a 911 caller reported that he looked suspicious. Stories about McClain, a massage therapist described by family and friends as a gentle and kind introvert, filled social media, including how he volunteered to play his violin to comfort cats at an animal shelter. The Aurora Police Department has been plagued by allegations of misconduct against people of color, including a officer charged this summer with pistol-whipping a Black man. The department's new chief has vowed to work to rebuild public trust. Attorney General Phil Weiser said a grand jury indicted Officers Randy Roedema, Nathan Woodyard, and Jason Rosenblatt and fire department paramedic Jeremy Cooper and fire Lieutenant Peter Cichuniec on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Roedema and Rosenblatt also each were charged with second-degree assault with intent to cause bodily injury and one count of a crime of violence related to the assault charge. Cooper and Cichuniec also each face three counts of second-degree assault. The Associated Press has sought comment from lawyers for the defendants. The Aurora Police Association said there was no evidence the officers caused McClain's death. ""The hysterical overreaction to this case has severely damaged the police department,"" the union said in a statement. At a brief news conference, Weiser said the goal was to seek justice for McClain and his loved ones. ""He was a son, a nephew, a brother, a friend,"" Weiser said. ""He had his whole life ahead of him."" Mother Sheneen McClain ""is overwhelmed emotionally by this news and appreciates the hard work of Phil Weiser and the rest of his team. There is not a day that goes by that she does not think of her son Elijah,"" according to a statement from her lawyer, Qusair Mohamedbhai. It's very rare for officers to face criminal charges in on-duty deaths, and it's almost unheard of for paramedics to be charged, said Alex Piquero, a criminologist at the University of Miami. ""It's a pretty big deal,"" he said. The fact that a grand jury saw the evidence and decided what charges to file is an indication of a strong case, Piquero said. Facing pressure during nationwide protests last year, Democratic Governor Jared Polis ordered Weiser to open a new criminal investigation. In 2019, a district attorney said he could not charge the officers because an autopsy could not determine how McClain died. It's one of several investigations, including separate reviews of McClain's arrest commissioned by the city and a comprehensive review of the Police Department. The US Justice Department and the FBI also announced a civil rights investigation into McClain's death, while Weiser's office is conducting a similar probe into the agency, the first under a new Colorado police accountability law. Aurora's highly critical review did not find any evidence to justify officers stopping McClain as he walked home from the store on Aug. 24, 2019, after a 911 caller had reported a man wearing a ski mask and waving his hands who seemed ""sketchy."" His family said McClain wore the mask because he had anemia that caused him to get cold easily. Police body camera video shows an officer approaching McClain on the sidewalk and saying, ""I have a right to stop you because you're being suspicious."" The officer turns McClain around and says, ""Relax, or I'm going to have to change this situation."" As other officers help restrain McClain, he asks them to let go, saying, ""You guys started to arrest me, and I was stopping my music to listen."" The officers' body cameras come off as they move McClain to the grass, but an officer can be heard saying McClain grabbed one of their guns. McClain tries to explain and sometimes cries out or sobs. He says he can't breathe and was just on his way home. ""I'm just different. I'm just different, that's all. That's all I was doing. I'm so sorry. I have no gun. I don't do that stuff. I don't do any fighting. Why were you attacking me? I don't do guns. I don't even kill flies,"" he said. One officer eventually retrieves his camera, which shows McClain handcuffed, lying on his side and periodically vomiting as another officer leans on him. Paramedics arrived and injected the 140-pound McClain with 500 milligrams of ketamine - more than 1 1/2 times the dose for his weight. The fire department is allowed to use the drug to sedate combative or aggressive people, but there's a lack of police training, conflicting medical standards, and nonexistent protocols that have resulted in hospitalizations and even deaths when it's used during police encounters. Within five minutes, according to a federal lawsuit from McClain's family, he stopped breathing. He was later declared brain dead and taken off life support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Social Security is projected to be insolvent a year earlier than previously forecast  The financial outlook for Social Security is eroding more quickly than previously expected, as the coronavirus pandemic has drained government revenues and put additional strain on one of the nation's most important social safety net programs. The overall finances for Medicare, however, are expected to hold steady, though the health program is still forecast to face financial pressure in the coming years. Annual government reports released Tuesday on the solvency of the programs underscored the questions about their long-term viability at a time when a wave of baby boomers are retiring and the economy faces ongoing uncertainty as variants of the coronavirus surge. The US economy already faces soaring federal debt levels in the coming decades, but both Democrats and Republicans have been wary of making significant structural reforms to the popular programs. FULL TEXT ""Having strong Social Security and Medicare programs is essential in order to ensure a secure retirement for all Americans, especially for our most vulnerable populations,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. ""The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to safeguarding these programs and ensuring they continue to deliver economic security and health care to older Americans."" Senior administration officials said that the long-term effects of the pandemic on the programs are unclear. The actuaries were forced to make assumptions about how long COVID would continue to cause unusual patterns of hospitalizations and deaths and whether it would contribute to long-term disabilities among survivors. The Social Security Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund will now be depleted in 2033, a year earlier than previously projected, according to the report. At that time, the trust fund will run out of reserves and the program will be insolvent, with new tax revenues failing to cover scheduled payments. The report estimated that 76 percent of scheduled benefits will be able to be paid out unless Congress changes the rules to allow full payouts. The Disability Insurance Trust Fund is now expected to be depleted by 2057, which is eight years earlier than previously thought, at which time 91 percent of benefits will be paid. Medicare's finances are effectively holding steady. While tax revenue for the Medicare program did decline as a result of the COVID-related recession, Medicare also ended up spending less money than usual last year, as people avoided elective care. Medicare's hospital trust fund is projected to be unable to pay all of its bills beginning in 2026. This estimate is similar to those from Medicare's trustees in recent years. Fixing that gap now could be achieved by increasing the Medicare payroll tax rate from 2.9 percent to 3.67 percent or by reducing Medicare spending by 16 percent each year, the report notes. But the report highlighted that the official estimate may be unrealistically optimistic. If certain policies set to expire in the next 10 years are extended, or if other expected policy changes occur, the projections would look substantially more worrying. Long-term, the actuaries said they did not think COVID-19 itself would have substantial influence on Medicare spending on hospital care. On the one hand, the death of many vulnerable, older Americans from the virus may reduce future spending they would otherwise have received. On the other, the actuaries expect that some people may have additional health care needs from the syndrome known as long COVID. The actuaries declined to make any estimates on the effect of Aduhelm, a very expensive Alzheimer's treatment that was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The report said that officials were waiting for Medicare to issue guidance on how the drug will be covered before making any calculations. The drug could represent tens of billions of dollars in spending each year. Democrats in Congress are considering a host of changes to the Medicare program, such as adding new benefits, including coverage for dental, hearing, and vision care.

"Patriots place wide receiver N'Keal Harry on injured reserve  Link to Image The Patriots placed wide receiver N'Keal Harry on injured reserve, which means he will miss at least the first three  weeks of the season. Harry suffered an upper-body injury during New England's second exhibition game, against the  Eagles, and hasn't practiced since. He left Lincoln Financial Field that evening with his left arm in a sling. FULL TEXT Without Harry, the Patriots will have Nelson Agholor, Kendrick Bourne, Jakobi Meyers, and Gunner Olszewski available at wide receiver. They also  can temporarily elevate two players from the practice squad each week. Harry, drafted in the first round in 2019, has yet to have a breakout NFL season. As a rookie, he missed the first eight games  on injured reserve. RB-WR Perry is claimed The Patriots claimed Malcolm Perry off waivers from the  Dolphins. To make room on the 53-man roster, they  released linebacker Harvey Langi. Perry, who played quarterback at Navy, has transitioned to both wide receiver and running back in the NFL. The Dolphins drafted him in the seventh round (246th overall) in 2020, but the Patriots also seemed to consider the possibility. ""There's a big tie with Navy and Coach [Bill] Belichick,"" Perry said after getting drafted. ""I talked to him quite a few times. They probably showed the most interest."" Hoyer among returnees None of the players the Patriots released were claimed via waivers, which meant they were able to bring back several familiar faces to their 16-man practice squad. Nine players who participated in training camp will return:  Quarterback Brian Hoyer, wide receivers Tre Nixon and Kristian Wilkerson, tight end Matt LaCosse, defensive backs Myles Bryant and D'Angelo Ross, defensive linemen Tashawn Bower and Bill Murray, and offensive lineman Alex Redmond. New faces joining them on the practice squad include linebacker Jahlani Tavai and fullback Ben Mason. Patriots senior football adviser Matt Patricia is familiar with Tavai, as the  Lions drafted the 24-year-old Hawaii grad in the second round in 2019. Belichick indicated Wednesday morning there are still plenty of moves to come this week. ""The roster-building process is far from complete,"" he said. ""There's a lot of movement still to go. It'd be inappropriate for me to comment on some positions, some situations that are really still in the process, that are not at the final point yet.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Red Sox issue new rules on mask-wearing at Fenway Park in light of citywide mandate  Link to Image When the next Red Sox homestand begins Friday against Cleveland, fans will need to keep their masks handy, if not on their faces, for the duration of their visit to Fenway Park. FULL TEXT A citywide mask mandate for indoor spaces intended to combat the spread of COVID-19 went into effect last Friday, with the Red Sox on the road. After the Aug. 20 announcement of the mandate, the Red Sox consulted with the City of Boston to clarify which spaces at Fenway Park qualified as indoor. The list includes team stores, restrooms, and elevators, and indoor clubs, restaurants, and suites. In a message about the new restrictions on the team website, the Red Sox stated: ""Masking will be required in all publicly accessible indoor spaces at Fenway Park, regardless of vaccination status, with the exception of those who are actively eating and drinking."" The club encourages anyone who is not vaccinated to wear a mask at all times, and reminds fans that masks must cover both nose and mouth.

"Mass. officials blast restrictive Texas law banning most abortions in state  Link to Image Advocates and elected officials in Massachusetts on Wednesday blasted a Texas law banning most abortions in the Lone Star State that took effect at midnight.  Among the groups that support abortion rights that strongly criticized the Texas law was NARAL Pro-Choice MA, which tweeted Wednesday that the measure ""gives politicians, neighbors, and even strangers the right to sue those who provide - or just help patients get - abortion after 6 [weeks]. They won't stop with Texas. If we don't fight back, we could see similar restrictions across the country."" Massachusetts Attorney Maura Healey also took aim at the law. FULL TEXT ""Texas' radical new abortion ban forces powerless patients to carry pregnancies, regardless of rape or incest, or have their doctors & families threatened with legal action,"" Healey tweeted Wednesday. ""We will fight this latest effort to overturn Roe v. Wade & stand up for freedom, privacy, and basic rights."" Representative Ayanna Pressley, a Boston Democrat and leading member of the so-called Squad of progressive female members of Congress, tweeted Wednesday that Texas lawmakers had failed their constituents by enacting such a restrictive abortion law. ""When states like Texas fail the people, When the courts fail the people, Congress must LEAD,"" Pressley tweeted. ""We must #ActForAbortionAccess."" Her words were echoed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Cambridge Democrat who unsuccessfully sought her party's presidential nomination last year. ""The Texas abortion ban is an unconstitutional attack on reproductive rights - an attack happening all across America,"" Warren tweeted. ""Let's be very clear: We're going to fight this ban and defend #RoeVWade."" Another Massachusetts politician voicing anger over the Texas law was state Senator Jamie Eldridge, an Acton Democrat. ""Outraged by Texas enacting this law severely restricting abortion rights, incl/ banning abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy & allowing individuals to bring civil lawsuits against abortion providers,"" Eldridge tweeted. ""An injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" The Texas law stands as the most the most dramatic restriction on abortion rights in the country since the Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion across the country in 1973. The high court was silent Wednesday on an emergency appeal to put the Texas law on hold. Republican Governor Greg Abbott in May signed the Texas measure into law. It bars abortions once medical professionals can detect cardiac activity, usually around six weeks and before most women know they're pregnant. ""As we knew would happen, thanks to a politically manipulated #SCOTUS, Texas now bans almost all #abortions,"" tweeted Mass. state Senator Becca Rausch, a Needham Democrat, on Wednesday. ""1st time since #RoeVWade that a state successfully banned #abortion early in pregnancy."" In Massachusetts, abortion rights are more secure. The state last year passed the ROE Act, which made it into law at the end of 2020 over Governor Charlie Baker's veto. It codified and expanded the right to abortion in Massachusetts. ""Let's be clear: Abortion is health care,"" tweeted Representative Katherine Clark, a powerful Melrose Democrat who also serves as assistant US House speaker, on Wednesday. ""The Texas abortion ban is an unconstitutional attack on our rights and will undeniably hurt Black, Latino and low income Texan women most. But we won't back down.""

"When will the Delta surge end?  Link to Image The United States has entered the fourth wave of the pandemic - or fifth, depending on which expert you ask. As the vaccination campaign lags and the contagious delta variant spreads, cases and hospitalizations are at their highest since last winter. COVID-19 deaths, too, are on a steady incline. After every other peak has come a trough, however, often for reasons that were not immediately obvious. In Britain, where the variant is also the dominant form of the coronavirus, daily cases fell from a peak of 60,000 in mid-July to half that within two weeks, though they have since been climbing again. FULL TEXT In India, the numbers spiked to more than 400,000 daily cases this spring; experts estimated that the true figure could be more than 20 times greater. The unimaginable toll shocked many who had declared that the country had successfully eluded the virus. But then, in June, infections fell drastically. Scientists are struggling to understand why delta outbreaks in those countries dissipated, even if temporarily, and what that may mean for similar surges, including the one in the U.S. In the U.S., the variant's pace has slowed, and new infections are falling in some states, like Missouri, that delta struck hard. The number of infections over the last week is now 14% higher than it was two weeks ago, a fraction of the rate during much of July and early August. Is the delta surge beginning to slow in the U.S.? Or is the variant putting the country on course for months of bumps and valleys? Expert opinion varies widely on the direction of the virus in the coming months. A number of national forecasts being tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predict that cases will rise in the early weeks of September - but many foresee the opposite. ""Whatever downturn we have, I think, will be fairly mild,"" said Dr. Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York. ""We're right at that tipping point where back-to-school will tip us back into growth at some point."" Gounder predicted that cases in the U.S. would climb again in September before subsiding in October. The virus may have burned through unvaccinated segments of the population this summer, Gounder said, but other people remained vulnerable. ""I don't think that means that everybody who was susceptible has been infected,"" she said. ""I think people tend to have a false sense of security about that."" As schoolchildren and some office workers begin mixing in greater numbers this fall, for example, resurgences may appear, she said. Other epidemiologists said that they were encouraged by trends in Southern states where schools had already opened, noting that while infections were growing among children, they were also falling off among adults. It is important ""not to overly extrapolate"" from delta's course through Britain and India, Gounder added. The three countries vary greatly in the percentage of population vaccinated, the ages of the vaccinated, the embrace of large gatherings and open schools, and the prevalence of mask-wearing and other precautions. Even the weather may be playing a role. Britain's infections thinned in the summer, while the U.S. is heading into fall with a huge burden of cases. More people gathering indoors will mean more opportunities for the virus to spread. Delta's path across the U.S. has depended heavily upon vaccination rates, social behaviors, the weather and various levels of precautions, epidemiologists said. Week on week, cases are now falling in a number of Southeastern states and California, but rising across much of the Midwest and Northeast. The variant is thought to be more contagious than previous versions of the coronavirus because the infected carry it in substantially greater amounts in their airways. This makes the variant particularly adept at exploiting opportunities for transmission - the crowded nightclub, the classroom with an unmasked teacher. But it also means that even modest restrictions, like masking and distancing, can bring numbers back down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Companies add fewer jobs than forecast, ADP data show  Link to Image US companies added fewer jobs than expected in August, reflecting persistent hiring challenges and suggesting a slowdown in the labor market recovery. FULL TEXT Businesses' payrolls increased by 374,000 last month, after a revised 326,000 gain in July, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The figure fell short of all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The weaker-than-expected hiring gain suggests firms are still struggling to attract applicants and fill a record number of vacant positions. At the same time, the Delta variant could present additional headwinds to hiring if consumer spending on services like dining out pulls back meaningfully. Service-provider employment increased 329,000 in August. Payrolls at leisure and hospitality businesses advanced 201,000 during the month. Employment at goods producers was up 45,000, led by a 30,000 jump in construction. ""The delta variant of Covid-19 appears to have dented the job market recovery,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said in a statement. ""Job growth remains strong, but well off the pace of recent months."" The combined payroll gain in July and August was the slowest since the start of the year, according to ADP. The figures come just before the government's monthly jobs report, and economists expect private payrolls to advance by 652,000 in August. The unemployment rate is projected to fall to 5.2 percent as participation improves. The increase in August payrolls was broad across firm sizes. Companies with 500 or more workers added 138,000 while small businesses took on 86,000.

"Officers, paramedics charged in Elijah McClain's 2019 death  Link to Image DENVER (AP) - Colorado's attorney general said Wednesday that a grand jury indicted three officers and two paramedics in the death of Elijah McClain, a Black man who was put in a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative two years ago in suburban Denver. The 23-year-old's death gained widespread attention during last year's protests against racial injustice and police brutality following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. FULL TEXT McClain's pleading words that were captured on police body camera video - ""I'm just different"" - have been posted on signs at protests and spoken by celebrities who have joined those calling for the prosecution of the officers who confronted McClain as he walked down the street in the city of Aurora after a 911 caller reported he looked suspicious. Stories about McClain, a massage therapist family and friends described as a gentle and kind introvert, filled social media, including how he volunteered to play his violin to comfort cats at an animal shelter. Attorney General Phil Weiser said all five officers and paramedics were charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, while some also face additional charges. Facing pressure during nationwide protests last year, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis ordered Weiser to open a new criminal investigation. A district attorney had said in 2019 that he could not charge the officers because an autopsy could not determine how McClain died. In January, Weiser announced that he had opened a grand jury investigation, noting that grand juries have the power to compel testimony and documents that would otherwise be unavailable. It was one of several investigations prompted at least in part by McClain's death, including separate reviews of McClain's arrest commissioned by the city of Aurora and a comprehensive review of the Police Department. The attorney general's office also is conducting a civil rights investigation into the agency, the first under a new police accountability law in Colorado. Aurora's highly critical review did not find any evidence to justify officers stopping McClain as he walked home from the store on Aug. 24, 2019, after a 911 caller had reported a man wearing a ski mask and waving his hands who seemed ""sketchy."" His family said McClain wore the mask because he had anemia that caused him to get cold easily. Police body camera video shows an officer getting out of his car, approaching McClain on the sidewalk and saying, ""Stop right there. Stop. Stop ... I have a right to stop you because you're being suspicious."" In the video, the officer puts his hand on McClain's shoulder and turns him around and repeats, ""Stop tensing up."" As McClain verbally protests, the officer says, ""Relax, or I'm going to have to change this situation."" As the other officers join in to restrain McClain, he asks them to let go and says, ""You guys started to arrest me, and I was stopping my music to listen."" What happened next isn't clear because all of the officers' body cameras come off as they move McClain to the grass, but the officers and McClain can still be heard. An officer says McClain grabbed one of their guns. McClain can be heard trying to explain himself and sometimes crying out or sobbing. He says he can't breathe and was just on his way home. ""I'm just different. I'm just different, that's all. That's all I was doing. I'm so sorry. I have no gun. I don't do that stuff. I don't do any fighting. Why were you attacking me? I don't do guns. I don't even kill flies. I don't eat meat. ... I am a vegetarian,"" he said. One officer eventually retrieves his camera, which shows McClain handcuffed, laying on his side and periodically vomiting as another officer leans on him. An officer who arrived later threatened to get his police dog to bite McClain. Paramedics arrived and injected the 140-pound (63.5-kilogram) McClain with 500 milligrams of ketamine - more than 1 1/2 times the dose for his weight. The fire department is allowed to use the drug to sedate combative or aggressive people, but there's a lack of police training, conflicting medical standards and nonexistent protocols that have resulted in hospitalizations and even deaths when it's used during police encounters. Within five minutes, according to a federal lawsuit from McClain's family, he stopped breathing. He died six days later after being declared brain dead and taken off life support. A pathologist who conducted an autopsy said a combination of a narrowed coronary artery and physical exertion contributed to McClain's death. Dr. Stephen Cina found no evidence of a ketamine overdose and said several other possibilities could not be ruled out, including an unexpected reaction to ketamine or the chokehold causing an irregular heartbeat. The carotid hold that was used on McClain involves applying pressure to the sides of the neck, stopping the flow of blood to the brain to render someone unconscious. It has been banned by police departments and some states, including Colorado, following Floyd's killing. A lawsuit from the family alleges that McClain died as a result of a dramatic increase of lactic acid in his blood caused by excessive force used by police over about 18 minutes, combined with the effects of the ketamine. They claim that police continued to ""torture"" McClain even after he was restrained, treatment they say is a result of the department's history of ""unconstitutional racist brutality."" The attorney general's announcement comes after three Aurora officers, including one involved in the encounter with McClain, were fired and one resigned last year over photos mimicking the chokehold used on the 23-year-old. The department's new chief, who fired those officers as its interim leader, has vowed to work to rebuild public trust since McClain's death and other police encounters with people of color. However, Vanessa Wilson spent her first days as chief last year apologizing after Aurora officers put four Black girls on the ground and handcuffed two of them next to a car that police suspected was stolen but turned out not to be. A prosecutor later decided there was no evidence the officers committed a crime but urged the Police Department to review its policies to ensure that something similar does not happen again. In July, an Aurora police officer was charged with assault after being captured on body camera video pistol-whipping and choking a Black man during an arrest. Another officer was charged with not intervening as required under the police accountability passed amid last year's protests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Scientific statement from Brigham doctor, other researchers looks at COVID-19 and heart failure  Link to Image Patients who have suffered heart failure are at a heightened risk for severe outcomes if they contract COVID-19, according to a scientific statement from a research panel led by a cardiovascular specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. FULL TEXT The statement from the Heart Failure Society of America was published in the Journal of Cardiac Failure. Dr. Ankeet S. Bhatt, a clinical and research fellow at the Brigham's Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, served as lead author and cochair of the committee that wrote the statement, along with Dr. Anuradha Lala of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. ""Patients with heart failure are uniquely susceptible to adverse outcomes in the setting of COVID-19 infection, highlighting the importance of vaccination,"" the statement said. Brigham and Women's said the society's statement discussed such questions as the effect of COVID-19 on patients with histories of heart failure, the implications for heart transplants, and concerns about COVID-19-related myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. The Brigham said the society's statement also addressed lingering questions about the effects of COVID-19 and described persistent cardiac symptoms and evidence of cardiac injury that may occur during post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, more commonly known as ""long COVID."" The society's statement was posted Wednesday to the Journal of Cardiac Failure's website. It says that in ""a retrospective analysis of over 8 million individuals with HF [heart failure] from the National Inpatient Sample, those diagnosed with influenza during hospitalization had higher rates of in-hospital mortality, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure even after propensity matching. Together, these data identified patients with HF as possibly more vulnerable to serious adverse events associated with COVID-19."" And here's what the research team said, in part, about the challenging issue of transplants: ""Heart transplantation and non-urgent surgical, electrophysiology, and catheter procedures for HF should likely be deferred if a candidate tests positive"" via PCR test. Heart failure occurs when the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it is supposed to.

"I guess we're all introverts now?  Link to Image The other night I saw my close friend Sara. We ate dinner and watched cartoons, which is something we did a lot before the pandemic. When I returned home, grateful it felt safe to see each other in person, I fought the urge to send her an apology text. ""Sorry I was weird tonight!"" Or maybe, ""Sorry I was so tired tonight!"" I started typing my favorite 2021 message: ""Hope I didn't seem off!"" FULL TEXT Our evening together was light and fun, but maybe I was awkward. To be honest, I can't figure out whether my introversion and mild social anxiety, which seems more pronounced after 2020, is preventing me from being my usual self, whatever that means. Lately, I'm insecure about most of my interactions, especially with those closest to me. I could send a ""sorry that was awkward/tense/weird/uncomfortable"" message after every friend-date, if I let myself. Last month, as I noticed this ""am I weird?"" question wasn't going away, I found myself looking for books about introversion. I've always been a very extroverted introvert; I need a lot of alone time, but I can speak in front of a crowd if I need to, and I have no trouble making friends. But in 2021, my old talents seem muted. I know I'm not alone. Even if you were a bold extrovert before COVID-19, you're probably experiencing some social second-guessing now. The main source of support I found for my worries was in a memoir/guide called ""Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want to Come"" by Jessica Pan, who writes that she's a ""shintrovert"" (""shy introvert"") raised by social parents, a Jewish mom and Chinese dad. ""I love my parents. I do,"" she writes, adding that her parents will ""talk to anyone: flight seatmates, waiters ... My father is the most unpredictable: I've seen him hit the ground in hotel lobbies to show doormen how to improve their push-up form, ask a Polish waitress whether she missed her family deeply and regretted moving to London, and discuss circumcision rates in the US versus the UK at my own wedding. With my new British in-laws. Whom he'd met the night before."" Pan, a Brown University grad who lives in London now, starts the book as a person most likely to leave a party. She's the opposite of her dad. She doesn't want to be lonely, but company isn't always easy. Had I read her memoir when it came out in 2019, I would have thought, ""She seems nice, but I'm nothing like her."" In 2021, however, I found myself deeply connected to every line, scribbling down the tips she culls from behavioral scientists about how to initiate interaction without overthinking. The premise of ""Sorry I'm Late"" is that Pan forces herself to try extroverted things. She speaks in front of audiences. She has a hilarious journey starting conversations with strangers in London. She networks. In every situation, she tells you how it went and what she learned. For the most part, she learns that socialization is not so scary once you try it and realize the worst-case scenario is not that bad. Some risks she takes in the book are irrelevant at the moment. I'm not sure anyone needs to figure out how to host or navigate a big party just yet. But much of her story is applicable to now - so relevant to the ways many of us got used to Zooming with loved ones, being alone, and living without the small conversations that happened in an office or at a coffee shop. My biggest takeaway from the book was something I've experienced since 2020 but couldn't explain until reading Pan's story. Pan learns that her interactions with strangers are better when they're the opposite of small talk - when she allows even small conversations to be transparent and personal. Genuine connections, even with someone she'll never meet again, leave her feeling elated. Behavioral scientists confirm this will be the case, and that strangers who seem opposed to chatting actually do want to engage, as long as the back-and-forth is genuine. One test of this theory has Pan talking to a man named Claude on a train. The interaction starts small, and then she listens to his personal stories, and it works on both sides. ""I'm also shocked to discover that talking to strangers turns out to be one of the cheapest, easiest ways to feel good and get a hit of dopamine when you're feeling low, or lost in your own world,"" she writes. ""When Claude and I parted ways at the Gare du Nord, he said, 'I never do this but I wish I did. This journey passed like a dream. (He's French, so he's allowed to say things like this.)"" I've experienced the same with strangers this year. I've found myself in deep conversations with the woman who's delivered my groceries through an app since mid-2020 (I now call her a friend). I've had weird bonding talks with people at call centers who I'll never meet in person. I never feel awkward about having deep talk with strangers. What feels strange, these days, is keeping it light, especially when I'm with my close friends. Are we allowed to do that? Keep it light? When so much isn't? I think that's why I want to text apologies after nights out with my loved ones. Maybe what I'm really asking is: ""Is it OK that we didn't talk about the 15 global elephants in the room?"" Maybe I got too good at talking about big things, and I'll have to practice being breezy using some of the stories in Pan's book as a guide. Because breezy is good, too. Breezy doesn't have to mean small talk; it can also mean fun. Silliness. Sitting around and watching cartoons. Maybe you'll pull different lessons from ""Sorry I'm Late."" Regardless, it's a very funny read, and it made me feel like I'm part of a world of second-guessers just trying to do their best right now. The book also makes a lovely gift. I would like to be Pan's friend, but the thought of that would probably stress her out. So I'll just wave from here.

"It's election season in Germany. No charisma, please!  BERLIN - The most popular politician who would like to be chancellor isn't on the ballot. The leading candidate is so boring people compare him to a machine. Instead of ""Yes, We Can!"" voters are being fired up with promises of ""Stability."" Germany is having its most important election in a generation but you would never know it. The newspaper Die Welt recently asked in a headline: ""Is this the most boring election ever?"" FULL TEXT Yes and no. The campaign to replace Chancellor Angela Merkel after 16 years of her dominating German and European politics is the tightest in Germany since 2005, and it just got tighter. The Social Democrats, written off as recently as a month ago, have overtaken Merkel's conservatives for the first time in years. But the campaign has also revealed a charisma vacuum that is at once typical of postwar German politics and exceptional for just how bland Merkel's two most likely successors are. No party is polling more than 25 percent, and for much of the race the candidate the public has preferred was none of the above. Whoever wins, however, will have the job of shepherding the continent's largest economy, making that person one of Europe's most important leaders, which has left some observers wondering if the charisma deficit will extend to a leadership deficit as well. While the election outcome may be exciting, the two leading candidates are anything but. Less than a month before the vote, the field is being led by two male suit-wearing career politicians - one balding, one bespectacled, both over 60 - who represent the parties that have governed the country jointly for the better part of two decades. There is Armin Laschet, governor of the western state of North-Rhine Westphalia, who is running for Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats. And then there is Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat who is Merkel's finance minister and vice chancellor. The candidate of change, Annalena Baerbock, the 40-year-old coleader of the Greens, has a bold reform agenda and plenty of verve - and has been lagging in the polls after a brief surge before the summer. It's a nail-biter, German-style: Who can most effectively channel stability and continuity? Or put another way: Who can channel Merkel? For now it seems to be Scholz - a man Germans have long known as the ""Scholz-o-mat"" or the ""Scholz machine"" - a technocrat and veteran politician who can seem almost robotically on message. Where others have slipped up in the campaign, he has avoided mistakes, mostly by saying very little. ""Most citizens know who I am,"" was Scholz's pitch to his party before being anointed chancellor candidate, conspicuously echoing Merkel's iconic 2013 line to voters: ""You know me."" More recently, one of his campaign ads showed his reassuring smile with a caption using the female form of the word chancellor, telling voters that he has what it takes to lead the country even though he is a man. ""Angela the second,"" was the title of a Scholz profile in the magazine Der Spiegel this week. Scholz has tried so hard to perfect the art of embodying the chancellor's aura of stability and calm that he has even been photographed holding his hands before him in the chancellor's signature diamond shape - making what is known as the Merkel rhombus. ""Scholz is trying to be Merkel's clone all the way down to the rhombus,"" said John Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany who has lived in Berlin on and off since the 1960s. ""The guy everyone likes best is the most boring guy in the election - maybe in the country. He makes watching water boil seem exciting."" But Germans, political observers point out, love boring. ""There are few countries where such a premium is put on being dull,"" said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European history at the University of Oxford, who has written about the country. It's not that Germans are resistant to charisma. When Barack Obama was running for president and delivered a rousing speech at the victory column in Berlin in 2008, 100,000 Germans cheered him on. But they don't want it in their own politicians. That's because the last time Germany had a rousing leader it didn't end well, noted Jan Böhmermann, a popular TV host and comedian. The haunting memory of Hitler's Nazi party winning office in free elections has shaped Germany's postwar democracy in various ways, Böhmermann said, ""and one of them is that charisma is banned from politics."" Andrea Römmele, dean of the Berlin-based Hertie School, put it this way: ""A Trump character could never become chancellor here."" Paradoxically, that's at least in part thanks to an electoral system bequeathed to Germany by the United States and its Allies after World War II. Unlike in the American presidential system, German voters don't get to elect their chancellor directly. They vote for parties; the parties' share of the vote determines their share of the seats in Parliament; and then Parliament elects the chancellor. And because it just about always takes more than one party to form a government - and this time probably three - you can't be too rude about the people you might rely on to be your coalition partners. ""Your rival today might be your finance minister tomorrow,"" Römmele said. As for the chancellor candidates, they are not chosen in primaries but by party officials who tend to pick people like themselves: career politicians who have given years of service to the party machine. Being good on television and connecting with voters doesn't cut it, said Jürgen Falter, an electoral expert at the University of Mainz. ""It's a strict oligarchic system,"" he said. ""If we had primaries, Markus Söder would have been the candidate."" Söder, Bavaria's ambitious governor, has heaps of beer-tent charisma and is the most popular politician in the country after Merkel herself. He was eager to run for chancellor, but the conservatives picked Laschet, a longstanding Merkel ally, not least, Römmele said, because at the time he looked most like ""the continuity candidate."" Recent polls give Scholz's Social Democrats the edge with between 23-25 percent, followed by 20-22 percent for Laschet's Christian Democrats, or CDU, and around 17 percent for the Greens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Here's what to know about the abortion law now in effect in Texas  Link to Image A law in Texas that bans abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy - before many women even know they are pregnant - went into effect early Wednesday, becoming one of the strictest abortion measures in the country. While the Supreme Court may still rule on the measure, which contradicts precedents set by the landmark Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey decisions, the high court has so far been silent. FULL TEXT Here's what to know about the new law. What does the law do? The measure bans abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks into pregnancy. The law provides an exemption for ""medical emergencies"" but it does not have an exception when there is rape or incest. The law was passed by the Texas House and Senate in mid-May and signed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott a few days later. It took effect on Sept. 1 after the Supreme Court failed to block it. What makes this law different from previous measures seeking to restrict abortions? The law was designed to make it difficult to be challenged in the courts because it prevents public officials from enforcing it, instead allowing private individuals to sue abortion providers or anyone who ""aids or abets"" the newly illegal abortions. That description extends to people who drive the person to the procedure, or help pay for it, among other situations. At least one anti-abortion group has set up a website where people can anonymously submit tips about potential violations. Instead of imposing a punishment for those who perform abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, the law allows anyone who helps a person obtain the procedure to sue. Anyone who successfully sues another person under the law would be entitled to at least $10,000. Abortion rights advocates say the measure creates confusion over who to sue in court. A lawsuit would typically name state officials as defendants, allowing plaintiffs to sue the officials who are responsible for enforcing the law. ""SB 8 effectively puts a bounty on anyone who supports a pregnant person seeking abortion care after about 6 weeks in pregnancy,"" Adrienne Kimmell, acting president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement denouncing the law. In an emergency request on Monday that asked the Supreme Court to block the measure, abortion providers in the state said it ""would immediately and irreparably decimate abortion access in Texas, barring care for at least 85% of Texas abortion patients (those who are six weeks pregnant or greater) and likely forcing many abortion clinics to ultimately close."" Similar laws banning abortions after six weeks that have been passed in states like Kentucky and Georgia have been blocked by federal courts. Abortion rights advocates fear that other states will take the court's silence on the Texas law as tacit approval and pass similar measures. Abortion providers described a scramble to perform procedures in the hours before the law took effect On Tuesday night, abortion clinics in Texas were filled with patients seeking the procedure hours before the law went into effect. Amy Hagstrom Miller, CEO of Whole Women's Health, which has four abortion clinics in the state, wrote on Twitter after 10 p.m. on Tuesday night that the waiting rooms were ""filled with patients and their loved ones,"" and its staff would work up until the minute the law went into effect. The last abortion at one of her clinics finished at 11:56 p.m. in Fort Worth, according to The Associated Press. Whole Women's Health also tweeted that anti-abortion activists were outside the clinic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"'Seinfeld' about to provide $500 million of comfort viewing on Netflix  Link to Image The battle of the oldies continues, as Netflix has just announced that all 180 episodes of ""Seinfeld"" will be coming to the streaming service on Oct. 1. Two other popular oldie hits, ""Friends"" and ""The Office,"" left Netflix in the recent past, the former to go to HBO Max and the latter to Peacock. But now Netflix can hold its head up again, as it boasts what many consider the best sitcom of all time. FULL TEXT  I know it seems silly to some that these dated series still have so much clout in the streaming world - so much that the services are paying hundreds of millions for five-year exclusive streaming rights. Reportedly, Netflix paid over $500 million for ""Seinfeld."" But when viewers sign up for a Netflix or an HBO Max, they want to have familiar programming to view in between the streamer's originals. For every current ""The Chair,"" Netflix subscribers also want a good old-fashioned comfort watch. Also, Netflix has said it would stream ""Seinfeld"" in 4K for the first time, so it may look better than ever.    Netflix has started promoting ""Seinfeld"" - which left Hulu in June - with a jokey ad. ""This fall,"" it begins, ""get ready for 2021′s hottest new show - well, not actually new, but never seen before"" ... pause ... ""on Netflix.""

"How technology cracked the case of a missing Camry  Link to Image When Tarikh Campbell stepped out of his boyhood home in Teaneck, N.J.,  last month, the parking space where he'd left his 2020 Toyota Camry was a patch of empty pavement. His Avis rental car had apparently been stolen. Campbell, an East Boston resident and program manager for workplace inclusion at Microsoft in Cambridge, didn't get much help from Avis, or the local police. So he set about to figure out the car's fate himself, with a welcome assist from some digital gadgets that just happened to be in the right place at the right time. FULL TEXT When he discovered the theft on the night of Aug. 14, ""I was freaked out, like, rubbing my eyes,"" said Campbell. He'd gone to Teaneck in mid-August for a relaxing weekend visit and had planned to spend Saturday night hanging out with friends. Instead, he found himself filing a stolen car report with the Teaneck police. The next morning, he took a Lyft to the Avis office near the Newark airport. As he handed over the keys to the missing car, a customer service worker told Campbell that he would be charged daily rental fees. The worker said that the car didn't contain a GPS tracker, so Avis couldn't help find it. And the worker added, ""If we don't find the car, you're going to be liable for it,"" Campbell recalled. ""I was pretty stressed out about that."" Campbell filed a claim with his personal auto insurance company, but he was warned that the payout might not cover the full cost of the rental car, which was newer than his own vehicle. In addition, he could expect to pay higher insurance premiums going forward. Insured or not, the loss of the car could cost him dearly. After flying home to Boston, Campbell remembered something he'd left behind in the car: his E-ZPass transponder for making automatic payments for road tolls. Realizing that the E-ZPass billing system automatically tracks a vehicle's movements along toll roads, he logged on to his account, and found that the missing Camry had indeed traveled on the New Jersey Turnpike that Saturday night. ""It got off the highway at the Newark airport exit,"" said Campbell. The next break in the case came from Campbell's aunt, whom he'd visited during the trip and who lived three doors down from Campbell's parents. The aunt had installed a video surveillance camera on her porch, which had a good view down the street. Recorded video from the camera showed a tow truck scooping up the vehicle and carting it away. But the car was legally parked. Who would have towed it? Car thieves? ""We weren't entertaining the idea that there was some organized crime group with tow trucks,"" said Campbell. ""This would most likely be done by Avis."" Combined with the location data from the E-ZPass, it was an open-and-shut case. When Campbell reported the car missing, the Avis worker had said the company couldn't track the car, but he must have been wrong. The company had found the vehicle in Teaneck and hauled it away. And sure enough, Campbell's Avis smartphone app now listed the car as having been returned, 90 minutes after his plane landed back in Boston. Case closed? Not quite. Campbell wanted reimbursement from Avis for his lost weekend, and the return of some personal items he'd left in the car. But phone calls to customer service left him frustrated. The company wouldn't even give him a direct phone number to the Newark rental office. ""I was even hung up on at times by customer service agents,"" Campbell said. Then he unleashed the ultimate weapon: Twitter. On Aug. 20, he cranked out a lengthy thread of tweets about his misadventure, complete with images of the E-Z Pass record and his aunt's surveillance video. The thread went viral, with thousands of likes from sympathetic readers. Avis began to pay attention. The company agreed to a full refund, and a return of his possessions. And it finally revealed what had happened. ""Our internal findings indicate there was an incorrect tow triggered by an administrative error on a previous rental,"" said an e-mail from an Avis spokesperson. ""Mistaken tows occur infrequently but we are taking steps to prevent situations like this from occurring at all in the future."" Like it or not, our lives are now under near-constant electronic surveillance, usually for the benefit of some far-off faceless corporation. But sometimes the digital spies are on our side.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"White-tablecloth service has come back to Amtrak. Here's what it's like I hopped aboard the Empire Builder for a ride from Seattle to Chicago, some great views, and lots of good food. Link to Image I hadn't seen my son who lives in Bellingham, Wash., since before the pandemic, and I had never slept on a train, so I decided to visit my son and then take the train from Seattle to Chicago on the way back to Boston. My romantic visions of ""North by Northwest"" and ""Some Like it Hot"" were fueled when I learned that Amtrak was returning some trains to white-tablecloth dining - a glamorous alternative to the prepackaged meals that have been standard fare since 2019. The Empire Builder is one train that has reinstated chef-prepared meals. It travels from Chicago to the Pacific Ocean, wending its way along the Mississippi roughly following the route of Lewis and Clark across the North Dakota plains, through the Wisconsin Dells, and dipping into Glacier National Park. It crosses a bit of Idaho and traverses the rugged terrain of Eastern Washington before it splits at Spokane, where some of the cars head to Seattle and others leave to go through the Columbia Gorge and onto Portland. According to Amtrak's Ridership reports, it's the most popular long-distance route, and many experienced riders claim that it is also the most scenic. Sold! FULL TEXT After a great visit with my son, I booked a roomette on the Empire Builder headed from Seattle to Chicago. I dropped off my rental car in downtown Seattle and walked a few blocks to King Street Station. Link to Image The Amtrak crew made sure that everyone with sleeping cars got on first (they really do say ""All Aboard!""), and as I collapsed into my tiny roomette, I heard the two whistle blasts signaling that we were on our way. A roomette is more private than a coach seat and less expensive than the slightly larger bedrooms. It's big enough for one person; cramped if there's two. There is a seat that transforms into a lower bunk and a narrow upper bunk that pulls down. Restrooms are shared and there's a shower stocked with towels and soap and with surprisingly good water pressure. Trains are all about schedules, and my car attendant, George, booked me for lunch in the dining car at 12:45. All meals are included with every sleeper car ticket. At the designated time, I walked down the length of the dining car and peeked at the burgers and Caesar salads on other people's plates. Our server, Lori, seated me at a table with another single woman. It was nice to have company. The baked potato topped with vegan chili looked good, and it was delicious. The only disappointment was that it was served on a plastic plate, with ice tea in plastic cups. Link to Image ""They are working on transitioning to china and glassware,"" Lori assured me. ""Come back at the end of the summer!"" After lunch, I took my book and another glass of ice tea to the Lounge Car, but with the breathtaking beauty of the Cascades and the chance to chat with fellow travelers (through masks), I never read a word. George took my dinner reservation for 6:45 and, as promised, there were white tablecloths, blue cloth napkins and fresh flowers on every table. I was seated with a couple from Fort Worth, Texas. We hit it off and all ordered a glass of wine (one is included with every meal) and it was served in real stemware. I ordered the crab and lobster cake for an appetizer. It's Amtrak's signature appetizer for a reason - it's delicious. For an entrée, I picked grilled Atlantic salmon, which was perfectly cooked and nestled on a bed of farro. My tablemates got the signature flat iron steak and the tortellini with pesto cream. Both were fabulous, they said. For dessert we passed around slices of flourless chocolate torte, cheesecake, and carrot cake. These were not made in the kitchen downstairs, but they were rich and wonderful. After dinner we headed to the lounge car, played cards, and watched the sunset over the farms and hills of Central Washington. When I returned to my roomette, George had made up the bed with sheets and a blanket. I climbed in and slept fitfully through the night. Sleeping on a train is not easy. There are lights and bells and whistle stops and some rough tracks. I woke up early and was delighted that there was a coffee station near my roomette. Fortified with caffeine, I lurched my way to the dining car. I was eager have breakfast and find a good seat to view Glacier National Park. Link to Image Breakfast options ranged from yogurt and oatmeal to omelets. I opted for scrambled eggs. Alas! The cloth napkins were replaced with paper and the coffee served in paper cups, but the food was good and I tipped Lori and found a place in the Lounge Car where I could watch Glacier's snowcapped mountains and rushing streams. I saw a moose. By dinnertime, we were entering North Dakota and I could tell that the staff was feeling stressed. The train had picked up more passengers in White Fish and was full. They had run out of some menu items and were completely out of dessert. My hips were grateful, but some passengers weren't as gracious. I ordered the crab cakes again and the chicken breast with wild mushroom risotto. My appetizer never came, and when I mentioned it to the server, Carl from the kitchen appeared with a double portion and an apology. These folks work hard. Link to Image The next morning, after breakfast, I spoke with the chef and her two-person crew. ""We have a 4-foot-by-3-foot grill and some steam trays, and we cook everything from scratch,"" she explained. While lunging along at 70 miles an hour, it can't be easy. Lunch was the last meal aboard. I sat with a college track coach who had great stories and a restrained appetite. He had a salad and I had a grilled cheese with turkey and bacon. We exchanged cards and promised to ""friend"" each other. With Chicago just a few hours away, I packed up my clothes, took a quick shower (still amazed at the water pressure!), tossed my book into my suitcase, and sat down to watch a little more of America pass by. Link to Image If you go . . . These are the room options on the Empire Builder Coach - The most economical choice. No meals are included, and you sleep in your seat. You can walk around the train, buy food from the café car (or pack your own), and enjoy the view from the lounge car. Roomette - Sleeps two people compactly. The upper bunk is bare bones with no windows and a strap so that no one falls out when the train lurches. There are shared lavatories and a shower in the hallway.

"How the Delta variant stole Christmas: empty shelves, long waits - and yes, higher prices  Link to Image More than 1 million Rainbow High dolls are primed for the holidays - but first they need to make it out of China. The popular toys have already overcome their share of hurdles, including short-staffed factories and record-high plastic prices. But now there's a shortage of the shipping containers that ferry them from Asian factories, warehouses, and ports, to American fulfillment centers and stores. ''I'm afraid there is simply not enough time to get products on the shelf this year,'' said Isaac Larian, chief executive of MGA Entertainment, the toy giant behind Rainbow High and such popular lines as L.O.L. Surprise and Little Tikes. ''The holidays are going to be very tough and, frankly, a lot of families are not going to be able to get the toys they want.'' FULL TEXT Mounting challenges - including factory shutdowns, computer chip shortages, and clogged ports - are rattling the industry as it prepares for the crucial holiday shopping season, an eight-week window that can account for more than half of a retailer's annual sales. The rapid spread of the Delta variant adds to the uncertainty: It already has forced a two-week shutdown of a terminal in one of China's busiest ports, and halted operations at one-third of Vietnam's garment and textile factories. And there are signs that consumers are pulling back. Retail sales took a hit in July, with Americans spending less on clothing, cars, and furniture as Delta took hold. The Biden administration has signaled that smoothing out the supply chain is a growing priority. Last week, the White House appointed a port envoy to address congestion at US ports while the recent bipartisan infrastructure deal includes $17 billion in investments for port infrastructure. But those efforts are unlikely to offer much reprieve before the upcoming busy season. Analysts say they expect widespread shortages, less selection, and higher prices for a number of popular holiday gifts, including gaming consoles, TVs, toys, and sneakers. ''COVID has turned supply chains on their head,'' said Neel Jones Shah, global head of airfreight for Flexport, a logistics technology company. ''We're seeing an astronomical rise in shipping rates, a dramatic lengthening of transit times, and a logjam of cargo at every port. Shippers are scrambling to figure out how to get their goods to market in time for the Christmas selling season.'' Two of the nation's largest retailers, Walmart and Home Depot, are chartering their own ships to retrieve their products while Amazon is beefing up its fleet of cargo planes. Urban Outfitters is switching from ocean freight to air in hopes of bypassing clogged ports in the run-up to the holidays. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Other brands are recalibrating to avoid the frenzy: Book publishers, dogged by paper shortages and shipping delays, are pushing fall releases into early next year. ''Everybody is in the same boat, saying, 'How do we ensure a supply of goods? What is most critical? What can we do without?''' said Robert Gerwig, senior vice president of distribution and logistics at Sweetwater, which sells musical instruments and audio technology. ''They're rapidly looking for other options to ensure goods are delivered in time.'' With weeks to go before summer slips into fall, store shelves already are sparse: At Walmart and Williams-Sonoma, executives say more items are out of stock than usual. Apparel chain Anthropologie is running low on dresses and jeans. Many retailers are whittling down their toy and clothing inventories, offering fewer styles, colors, and sizes, according to Nikki Baird, vice president of innovation at retail software provider Aptos. ''There is still so much up in the air, and the broader your assortment, the more risky it is that you get it wrong,'' she said. ''The easiest way to respond to inventory risk is to narrow the options so you can concentrate your risk to some degree.'' Everlane, which built its clothing brand around ethically sourced products, is focusing on classics like sweaters and jeans for the holidays. Even so, COVID-related complications are delaying orders by weeks, or sometimes months, according to chief product officer Erika Edelson. ''Ports are congested ... even causing boats to sometimes become stranded on the water,'' she said. ''Once our products are sold out, it may be weeks or months before we can restock.'' The time it takes to ship an item from Asia to the United States has roughly doubled - 15 days by air, 90 by sea - during the pandemic, Shah said. The backlog, coupled with labor shortages and pandemic-related shutdowns at every point in the process have led to monthslong waits for electronics, furniture and other imports. Such delays, analysts say, are likely to cascade in coming weeks. Freight volume at the Port of Los Angeles, the country's largest port, has increased for 12 straight months. ''This remarkable, sustained import surge is pushing the supply chain to new levels,'' said Gene Seroka, the port's executive director. Even once merchandise has made it to stores and warehouses, getting it to consumers' homes will be an ongoing challenge. Delivery carriers like UPS and FedEx are scrambling to hire thousands of truck drivers and package handlers. The US Postal Service has signaled plans to hire 40,000 seasonal workers and convert 33,00 non-career employees to career status to further scale-up capabilities. The holiday season produced recurring nightmares for the mail agency last year: The November election, in which nearly half the nation's voters cast their ballots by mail, combined with a workforce straining under COVID-era package volumes gummed up the Postal Service's entire network. Employee availability plummeted, and led to bins of packages choking walkways at sorting facilities. Food and temperature-sensitive items spoiled as they sat delayed; postal workers complained about flies swarming packages and the smell of rotting materials. Nine major sorting facilities turned away mail shipments during the height of the season, or attempted to divert it to other plants, according to an inspector general report. Scores of postal customers reported receiving holiday mail as late as April. This year, retailers are pulling together contingency plans, finding local and regional alternatives to national carriers and, in some cases, building up their own delivery capabilities. Target is tapping its own workers to drop off packages, and Walmart is creating a new last-mile service that will help other businesses get orders to customers' homes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Afghans face hunger crisis, adding to Taliban's challenges  Link to Image KABUL - The United Nations' stockpiles of food in Afghanistan could run out this month, a senior official warned Wednesday, threatening to add a hunger crisis to the challenges facing the country's new Taliban rulers as they endeavor to restore stability after decades of war. About one third of the country's population of 38 million doesn't know if they will have a meal every day, according to Ramiz Alakbarov, the UN's humanitarian chief in Afghanistan. FULL TEXT The UN's World Food Program has brought in food and distributed it to tens of thousands of people in recent weeks, but with winter approaching and a drought ongoing, at least $200 million is needed urgently to be able to continue to feed the most vulnerable Afghans, he said. ""By the end of September, the stocks which the World Food Program has in the country will be out,"" he told reporters at a virtual news conference. ""We will not be able to provide those essential food items because we'll be out of stocks."" Earlier, UN officials said that of the $1.3 billion needed for overall aid efforts, only 39 percent has been received. The Taliban, who seized control of the country ahead of the withdrawal of American forces this week, now must govern a nation that relies heavily on international aid and is in the midst of a worsening economic crisis. In addition to the concerns about food supplies, civil servants haven't been paid in months and the local currency is losing value. Most of Afghanistan's foreign reserves are held abroad and currently frozen. Mohammad Sharif, a shopkeeper in the capital of Kabul, said that shops and markets there have supplies, but a major concern is rising food prices. ""If the situation continues like this and there is no government to control the prices, that will cause so many problems for local people,"" he said. In the wake of the US pullout, many Afghans are anxiously waiting to see how the Taliban will rule. When they were last in power, before being driven out by the US-led invasion in 2001, they imposed draconian restrictions, refusing to allow girls to go to school, largely confining women to their homes and banning television, music, and even photography. But more recently, their leaders have sought to project a more moderate image. Schools have reopened to boys and girls, though Taliban officials have said they will study separately. Women are out on the streets wearing Islamic headscarves - as they always have - rather than the all-encompassing burqa the Taliban required in the past. The challenges the Taliban face in reviving the economy could give Western nations leverage as they push the group to fulfill a pledge to form an inclusive government and guarantee women's rights. The Taliban say they want to have good relations with other countries, including the United States. Many Afghans fear the Taliban won't make good on those pledges and also are concerned that the nation's economic situation holds little opportunity. Tens of thousands sought to flee the country as a result in a harrowing airlift. But thousands who had worked with the US and its allies, as well as up to 200 Americans, remained in the country after the efforts ended with the last US troops flying out of Kabul international airport just before midnight Monday. President Biden later defended his handling of the chaotic withdrawal and evacuation efforts, which saw spasms of violence, including a suicide bombing last week that killed 13 American service members and 169 Afghans. He said it was inevitable that the final departure from two decades of war would be difficult. He said he remains committed to getting the Americans left behind out if they want. The Taliban have said they will allow people with legal documents to travel freely, but it remains to be seen whether any commercial airlines will be willing to offer service. Bilal Karimi, an official member in the Taliban spokesman's office, said Wednesday that a team of Turkish and Qatari technicians arrived in Kabul to help get the airport up and running again. Alakbarov, the UN humanitarian official, said that the United Nations is asking for access to the airport so it can deliver food and other supplies directly to the capital. The Taliban also have to contend with the threat from the Islamic State group, which is far more radical and claimed responsibility for the bombing at the airport. The Taliban have pledged they won't allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for attacks on other countries - a key US demand since the militants once harbored the al-Qaida leaders who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks. In the wake of last week's bombing, American officials said drone strikes targeted the Islamic State group's affiliate in Afghanistan, and Biden vowed to keep up airstrikes. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday that it was ""possible"" that the US will have to coordinate with the Taliban on any counterterrorism strikes in Afghanistan in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the National Weather Service, a flood that is just six inches of fast moving water can knock over an adult and drag them downstream. So? Don't go wading in flood water and especially not in an area where a flash flood is active, the weather service warns. - Prepare your home. Move precious items to higher floors, charge up electronics. and if you have a sump pump, test it now and make sure that essential tool is fully operational before the rains come. ""Make a record of your personal property by taking photos or videos of your belongings. Store these records in a safe place,'' MEMA suggests. - A lot of data has been developed by government agencies about flooding concerns. But the best early warning system is probably among people who live in low lying areas near streams and rivers and other fresh water bodies in the state - they already know if they are at risk based on past experience. ""For this particular storm... this is not a coastal storm this is not a storm surge flooding,"" said Christopher Besse, spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. ""This is really a rain event...Over the years, people may know those areas prone to flooding."" He added: ""The real message is making sure people as best they can, understand the risk given where they live. If people do live near an area near a river, keep an eye on that. If the river starts approaching and getting closer than it - it's time to leave."" - Heed emergency warnings by officials. Coincidentally, Gov.

"Baker administration to require COVID-19 vaccinations for long-term care and home care workers  Link to Image All staff at rest homes, assisted living residences, and hospice programs, as well as home care workers will be required to get a coronavirus vaccination by Oct. 31, the Baker administration announced Wednesday. FULL TEXT The plan is part of the Baker administration's effort to protect older adults against the coronavirus, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services said in a statement. The plan follows an earlier announcement by the Baker administration that vaccines would be required for workers at skilled nursing facilities. The requirement would apply to 62 freestanding rest homes, 268 assisted living residences, 85 programs and up to 100,000 home care workers, the statement said. Workers will be required to get vaccinated ""unless they qualify for a limited exemption because they have a medical condition that prevents them from receiving vaccination or they object to vaccination based on a sincerely held religious belief,"" the statement said. For rest homes, assisted living residents, and hospice settings, the requirement applies to all those directly employed and contractors who regularly enter the facility. The requirement for home care workers applies to all individuals providing in-home, direct care who are employed by an agency that is contracted or subcontracted with the state, the statement said. It also applies to independent, non-agency-based care workers contracted with the state. The plan is subject to approval by the Public Health Council, a panel that advises the state Department of Public Health and promulgates regulations, the statement noted. Massachusetts assisted living executives urged the Baker administration earlier this month to mandate vaccines for their industry. They said thousands of frail elders in assisted living residences, most of them vaccinated but with weak immune systems, are still vulnerable to infections because many workers in the facilities have yet to get their shots, the Globe reported. ""We applaud this decision to protect everyone in Massachusetts assisted living communities - staff, residents, and their families. While most assisted living staff are vaccinated, this will further reinforce the safe and healthy environment that high rates of vaccination and robust infection control policies have helped us achieve,"" Brian Doherty, president and chief executive of the Massachusetts Assisted Living Association, said Wednesday in a statement. ""Many assisted living providers have proactively mandated the vaccine for their staff, and we thank the state for leveling the playing field to ensure that all staff are subject to vaccine mandates, which will help keep residents safe and healthy while also stabilizing the workforce,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"After Ida, small recovery signs amid daunting destruction  Link to Image NEW ORLEANS - Lights came back on for a fortunate few, some corner stores opened their doors, and crews cleared fallen trees and debris from a growing number of roadways Wednesday - small signs of progress amid the monumental task of repairing the damage inflicted by Hurricane Ida. Still, suffering remained widespread three days after Ida battered Louisiana and parts of Mississippi as the fifth-most-powerful hurricane to strike the United States. Some low-lying communities remained largely underwater. Roughly a million homes and businesses still had no electricity, and health officials said more than 600,000 lacked running water. FULL TEXT The death toll rose to at least six after a coroner confirmed a 65-year-old woman had drowned in her Louisiana home and police in Maryland said a 19-year-old man was found dead in an apartment complex flooded by heavy rain from Ida's remnants. And the staggering scope of the disaster began to come into focus, with a private firm estimating total damage from Ida could exceed $50 billion. With all of New Orleans blacked out except for those running generators, Byron Lambert woke up startled at about 1:30 a.m. when light suddenly came on down the hall from where he slept. He first thought it was a burglar, then realized his home had electricity. Lambert's house in eastern New Orleans was among more than 11,000 homes and businesses that had power restored early Wednesday, according to the electric company Entergy. ""When it came on it startled me. I'm like 'All right! We got power,'"" Lambert said, his enthusiasm tempered by the knowledge of what others were going through. ""I'm fortunate, but they have a lot of people that aren't as fortunate as me, and I pray for them because it's rough."" There were still 989,000 homes and businesses without power, or 44 percent of all state utility customers in southeast Louisiana, from the New Orleans area to Baton Rouge, according to the state Public Service Commission. Phillip May, president and chief executive of Entergy Louisiana, told reporters Wednesday he predicts ""a lot more progress"" in coming days. Still, he said full recovery will be slow, with thousands of power poles and transformers knocked out by the storm. In neighboring Mississippi, 32,000 customers had no electricity. Hard-hit areas in southeast Louisiana were under a heat advisory Wednesday, with forecasters warning combined heat and humidity could make some areas feel like 108 degrees Fahrenheit. Officials scrambled to offer food, water, and places to cool off. National Guard troops had handed out more than 141,000 meals, 143,000 liters of water, and more than 500 tarps in Louisiana as of Wednesday morning, according to Governor John Bel Edwards' office. In New Orleans, officials opened seven places where people could get a meal and sit in air conditioning. The city was also using 70 transit buses as cooling sites, Mayor LaToya Cantrell said. In New Orleans, some residents gathered at a basketball gym with large fans running to cool off and charge their phones. People took random boxes holding chicken salad or tuna salad, and a man outside offered granola bars, applesauce, and chips. More than 1,200 people were walking through some of Ida's hardest-hit communities to look for people needing help, according to the Louisiana Fire Marshal's office. In coastal Jefferson Parish, where Ida brought severe flooding, authorities were waiting for floodwaters to recede enough for trucks carrying food, water, and repair supplies to begin moving into Lafitte and other low-lying communities. ""We are pretty confident that those that wanted to get out have now been able to get out,"" said Captain Jason Rivarde of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, who said more than 100 people were rescued in the area. Search and rescue missions were tapering off but continued in four parishes that still had floodwaters, Brigadier General Lee W. Hopkins of the Louisiana National Guard said on a Zoom call. That's compared to 31 parishes in the hours immediately after the storm. President Biden was to visit Louisiana Friday to survey the damage, the White House said. In New Orleans, where the mayor estimated roughly half the population had evacuated, there were growing signs of recovery. Flags hung from dangling power lines to help drivers avoid them, and in one neighborhood, someone decorated the downed lines with strands of tinsel in an echo of Mardi Gras. City crews removing debris from roads and cutting up fallen trees had some streets almost completely cleared, while others remained cluttered with obstacles. A few corner stores were open, many taking cash only, though some had working ATM machines. In many areas, National Guard soldiers or law enforcement stood posted at pharmacies and gas stations, where drivers waited in long lines for fuel. Louisiana's transportation department announced that all interstate systems across the state had reopened and been cleared of debris. AT&T, which faced widespread cellphone outages after Ida, said it's currently operating at more than 90 percent of normal capacity. As a clearer picture of Ida's devastation emerged, the hurricane likely caused $50 billion to $60 billion in total damage, estimated Karen Clark, who has calculated catastrophic risk since 1987. Her risk modeling company, Karen Clark and Company, figured just $18 billion of those losses would be insured. Those estimates would rank Ida anywhere from the fifth- to seventh-costliest US hurricane based on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Katrina, Harvey, Maria, and Sandy were well over that amount. NOAA says 2017′s Irma incurred about $55 billion in damage and 1992′s Andrew about $53 billion in 2019 dollars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"History has its eyes on Boston's mayoral race In a city long marked by white hegemony, it matters that the next elected mayor will be a person of color. Link to Image Never before during my years in Boston have so many out-of-state friends asked me some variation of this question: ""So how's it looking up there?"" They want to know what's happening in Boston's mayoral campaign. On Sept. 14, acting Mayor Kim Janey, City Councilors Andrea Campbell, Annissa Essaibi George, and Michelle Wu, and John Barros, the city's former chief of economic development, will vie in the preliminary election. The top two finishers will face off in November, but whatever the results, this much is already known: For the first time in Boston's history, a person of color, most likely a woman, will be elected mayor. FULL TEXT If not quite a racial reckoning, it's a critical moment for Boston. And even those who don't live here feel as if they, too, have a stake in the outcome. That's been apparent since March when former mayor Martin J. Walsh departed City Hall to become President Biden's labor secretary. As succession protocol dictates, Janey, then city council president, was sworn in and became Boston's first person of color and first woman mayor. Even before she was the last candidate to announce her mayoral campaign, Janey garnered national headlines with her appointment, hers a different face representing what many hoped would lead to a different Boston. Janey is one of nine Black women leading one of the nation's 100 largest cities, including Lori Lightfoot (Chicago); Keisha Lance Bottoms (Atlanta); Muriel Bowser (Washington, D.C.); London Breed (San Francisco); LaToya Cantrell (New Orleans); and Tishaura Jones (St. Louis). All of those cities have previously had Black mayors. Only twice have Black candidates even survived to a final mayoral election in Boston. Both Mel King, in 1983, and Tito Jackson, in 2017, lost to white men. Now Bostonians seek a leader who better reflects the city's shifting demographics. In their television ads, both Campbell and Janey speak frankly of their personal tribulations. Campbell talks about growing up in public housing in Roxbury and how her twin brother, Andre, died while incarcerated. Janey cites her experiences as a child of Boston's acrimonious school desegregation era who briefly lived in a shelter and became a mother when she was 16. Wu, Essaibi George, and Barros have all touted their histories as small-business owners connecting them to many who even before the pandemic toiled to survive rising rents and rampant gentrification. Voters who have felt disenfranchised due to racism or sexism not only see candidates who look like them, but have also had to navigate similar struggles in this city. Each has seasoned their campaigns with lived experiences viewed not as deficits but trials that have shaped them and serve as assets that make them empathetic to constituents. This neither looks nor feels like past mayoral contests. Of course, the next mayor already knows that if racial progress is halting in America, in Boston it can be glacial. Not until Ayanna Pressley, now a congresswoman, won in 2009 had a Black woman been elected to the city council. Though people of color are the majority, the city remains as segregated as any in the nation. And in the past decade, the city's Black population declined 3.3 percent, more than any other group. When it comes to race in this city, the dead past is never allowed to bury its dead. Boston is - and isn't - the same place I moved to decades ago despite warnings from friends that the city would offer a young Black woman nothing but tears and disappointment. Results of a single election can't atone for Boston's complicated history. It won't erase the indelible image of an angry white man trying to impale a Black man with an American flag. It won't silence the persistent echoes of racial epithets at Fenway Park, or wipe away memories of a white man throwing a water bottle at Kyrie Irving of the Brooklyn Nets as the former Celtics player walked off the Garden floor last May. Anyone who remembers Barack Obama's ""postracial"" election and the ferocious white backlash that birthed the Trump presidency eight years later should know better. Yet with history's eyes set on Boston, a cautious embrace of this unique moment is still an embrace. In the national spotlight, this race is not only a referendum on transforming City Hall. It can counter with action a reputation long characterized by racial animus and white hegemony. And if the first elected mayor of color in Boston, of all places, can lead this city toward equity and justice, perhaps America will follow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MIAA tournament management committee reaches a compromise on COVID-19 dilemma  The MIAA's tournament management committee continues to clean up logistical issues and work through hurdles as the new statewide tournament officially rolls out with the start of the 2021-22 school year. Among the potential concerns is a major one athletic directors and administrators have faced for more than a year: What to do if a team is unable to play because of COVID-19. During Wednesday's first virtual meeting of the school year, the TMC grappled with the best way to handle games not being played because of COVID-19, particularly as it pertains to the new power rating system that will be used to select and seed tournaments in most MIAA sports. FULL TEXT The TMC already had voted unanimously Wednesday that if one team forfeits a game, it will be entered into the power ratings at the maximum allowed scoring margin for a particular sport - 14-0 for football and rugby, 10-0 for basketball and lacrosse, 5-0 for baseball and softball, and 3-0 for soccer, volleyball, and ice or field hockey. ""If it's a legit COVID reason why [a team] can't play, I'm not sure that I love the power rating system coming into play there,"" said Westborough athletic director Johanna DiCarlo, who originally motioned to have any COVID game declared a no-contest. Wellesley AD John Brown countered that it wouldn't be fair to the team not affected by COVID to lose out on a power rating opportunity for a game that doesn't get played. ""I just think that to penalize somebody that is trying to play the game, or to penalize somebody that can't play the game, is just not right,"" Brown said. The TMC haggled with the math concept of the power ratings - whether a game could count for one team and not the other - before agreeing that any games canceled and not made up because of COVID would be declared no-contests. A school then can appeal if cancellations cause a team to fail to reach a qualifying standard such as a .500 record or a minimum number of games played in a season. ""That's probably the best compromise in regards to assuring [a team] makes the tournament,"" said TMC chair Jim O'Leary of St. John's Prep. · In approving formats for 2021 fall sports, the TMC accepted the football committee's modification that a team must schedule at least seven games over the eight-week regular season (not including Thanksgiving). Also, because football brackets will be capped at 16 teams for each division, the TMC approved the recommendation that a team must have at least three wins to qualify - eliminating the possibility of a school finishing in the top 16 with two wins or fewer. · For boys' golf, the TMC removed previous language that would have allowed for the top two teams (plus ties) in a league to qualify for a sectional tournament - making it consistent with all other MIAA sports. · The TMC unanimously voted to set a minimum qualifying standard of 50 percent of the maximum allowed games in a particular sport - i.e., if the maximum number of games allowed in a sport is 20, a team must schedule at least 10 to qualify. · Seeding tiebreaker language was modified, making the second step in the process (behind head-to-head results) the Average of Opponent Ratings - which is one half of the new power ratings formula. · New Bedford AD Tom Tarpey (District 8) was introduced as the only new member of the committee. DiCarlo was elected as vice chair, replacing Mary Ryan of Rockport, who remains a TMC member.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"White House details plans to improve housing affordability  Link to Image WASHINGTON - White House officials are outlining plans to build and restore more than 2 million homes, a response to the volcanic rise in housing prices over the past year. FULL TEXT Millions of Americans are getting priced out of ownership or stuck spending the bulk of their income on rent. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index climbed a record 19.1 percent in June from a year ago, as too few homes are available to buy and low interest rates have enabled affluent buyers and real estate investors to pay more for homes. The jump in prices is a threat to President Biden's vision of centering the US economy around the middle class, a group that has defined itself in large part through home ownership. Americans' desire to own homes has also altered regional politics as suburbanites aligned with Democrats in 2020 to help give Biden key victories in Arizona and Georgia, two states that have added population through new home construction. The White House Council of Economic Advisers on Wednesday posted on its blog a detailed analysis of the affordability problem and the administration's plans to relieve it. Its analysis notes that housing supply has fallen short of population growth for four decades, so many of the challenges predate the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers at the mortgage buyer Freddie Mac estimate that the United States is 3.8 million homes shy of what is needed to meet demand. The persistent shortage has meant that home prices are steadily increasing faster than incomes, making it harder for first-time buyers to save for down payments and keeping them in rentals longer. Nearly half of renters spend more than the recommended 30 percent of their incomes on housing. To increase home construction, Biden's economics team proposes a series of policy shifts. First, it intends to deliver 100,000 affordable housing units over three years through a series of administrative changes. It will increase mortgage availability through Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae for manufactured houses and buildings with two to four units. The government also intends to make it easier for would-be owners and nonprofits to buy homes that failed to sell in foreclosure auctions, as well as expand outreach to local governments and nonprofits to buy federally held homes. The government also plans to increase the financing options for apartment buildings through tax credits, loans, and grants. Secondly, the Biden administration estimates that its economic agenda would lead to the construction and renovation of 2 million homes. This would include the use of federal subsidies, the low-income housing tax credit, a new tax credit for construction in economically vulnerable neighborhoods, and incentives to remove exclusionary zoning and land use policies by local and state governments that limit new construction. Still, the blog post cautioned that a supply crunch could linger. ""There is no magic formula to quickly relieve the supply constraints,"" it concluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moderna submits early data to FDA for third shot of COVID-19 vaccine  Link to Image (Bloomberg) -- Moderna said that it had filed initial data with the US Food and Drug Administration for clearance of a third-dose booster shot of its COVID-19 vaccine. FULL TEXT In a statement on Wednesday, the company said the booster shot, using a reduced dose of 50 micrograms that is half the dose used in the existing vaccine, raised antibody levels against the delta variant by more than 40-fold in a clinical trial. The company also said it planned to submit the data to regulators in Europe and elsewhere in the coming weeks. A panel of expert advisers to the FDA plans to hold a meeting on booster shots on Sept. 17, according to people familiar with the planning. The filing puts Moderna only slightly behind Pfizer and BioNTech in seeking official go-ahead for a third-dose booster. Those companies filed initial booster data with the FDA last month. A debate over booster shots is intensifying in the US amid a rise in breakthrough infections and a broader delta-variant fueled surge in illness. Still, moving too quickly toward booster shots is controversial among scientists, as there is little evidence that the capacity of vaccines to prevent serious illness, hospitalization and death has waned significantly. In clinical studies, a third shot given to people who participated in Moderna's original phase 3 trial more than six months after their first two shots boosted neutralizing antibodies significantly, according to results presented earlier this summer. There were no significant new side effects, the company said in an August earnings presentation. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are based on similar messenger RNA technology, and have produced similar overall results, but there are subtle differences. In particular, Moderna's current vaccine uses two 100 microgram doses, a higher amount than 30 microgram dose used in the Pfizer. While Pfizer has moved forward with the same dose for its booster shot, Moderna has been testing a lower dose 50 microgram for third dose booster, believing that it will not necessarily need to use a achieve a robust immune response. ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Are Marty Walsh and his mom on the same page in the Boston mayoral race? Annissa Essaibi George could be Walsh's not-so-secret favorite candidate. But her agenda is about tweaks, not shake-ups. And she does nothing to discourage speculation about Walsh's support. Link to Image As Marty Walsh's mother goes, so goes Marty Walsh? At his farewell press conference, as he left the mayor's office to become US labor secretary, Walsh said he wouldn't endorse or play any role in the race to replace him. He made no such pledge about his mother, Mary, who still lives in the Dorchester home where she raised her family - and supports Boston city councilor and mayoral candidate Annissa Essaibi George, who grew up on the same street. Asked on WCVB's ""On the Record"" whether the former mayor backs her candidacy, Essaibi George said: ""I have not asked him directly for his vote. I hope he will consider me on September 14. . . . I would say I'm grateful to have the support of his mother."" To which co-host Janet Wu noted, ""She has a sign on her front lawn for you."" Of course, Walsh's mother has every right to make that political statement. But does it also say something about where her son stands? A spokeswoman for the Department of Labor said Walsh can't speak about the mayor's race ""in light of rules limiting political activities by federal employees"" and his focus on Biden administration priorities. FULL TEXT The suggestion that Essaibi George is Walsh's not-so-secret favorite candidate isn't new. She made it the central joke of her St. Patrick's Day breakfast video, photoshopping him into old photos of herself. Her campaign manager, Cam Charbonnier, and communications director, Nicole Caravella, worked for Walsh, as did her political adviser, Tim Sullivan, now of the Liberty Square Group. With less than two weeks before the preliminary election, how does the Walsh factor play in a race billed as historic because no white man is in the running? Boston voters still like Walsh, at least according to a June poll in which he received a 72 percent job approval. Yet he also left behind serious problems in the police and school departments for Acting Mayor Kim Janey, the first Black person and first woman to hold that office, to handle. Meanwhile, minus the burden of executive decision-making, Essaibi George is working to assemble the coalition that twice elected Walsh, drawing support from West Roxbury, Hyde Park, South Boston, and Dorchester, along with backing from unions representing firefighters and EMS workers. William Gross, who was appointed by Walsh as the city's first Black police commissioner, also endorsed Essaibi George. Yet while Janey had to deal with fallout from Walsh's controversial appointment of Dennis White as Gross's successor - on Gross's recommendation - Essaibi George is unencumbered by it. On ""OTR,"" she said she has never asked Gross about White, who was fired by Janey because of domestic abuse allegations, which he denies. Essaibi George calls herself pragmatic, but she's often described as the status quo candidate. She wants to hire more police and keep admissions exams for Boston exam schools. During the ""OTR"" interview, she said she's ""nervous"" about vaccine passports and sounded equally nervous about a mask mandate. The delicate issue of race also influences the perception of her as something less than a change agent. Besides Janey, the other mayoral candidates are John Barros and Andrea Campbell, who are Black, and Michelle Wu, who is Asian American. Essaibi George's mother is PolishAmerican and her late father emigrated from Tunisia; she identifies as a woman of color. Yet she's viewed as the candidate of white Boston. (According to a recent poll, she and Wu drew the same support - 24 percent - from white voters.) The Essaibi George campaign said that, like Walsh, she's ""a constant presence"" in all Boston neighborhoods. It's also true that Walsh won his last campaign against Tito Jackson, who is Black, with crossover support from Black voters. In some ways, Essaibi George does represent change from the Walsh era.

"Julian Edelman believes Patriots didn't want the 'distraction' of a quarterback competition  Link to Image Now retired from the NFL after 12 seasons, former Patriots receiver Julian Edelman has crossed over to the media,  joining the Paramount+ show ""Inside the NFL"" as an analyst for the 2021 season. FULL TEXT Appearing on a media call Wednesday to promote his new role, Edelman said he ""intensely"" watched the Patriots preseason games and was impressed with Mac Jones's performance. ""I think the kid came out and he did well - he did very well,"" Edelman said. ""You could see it in his eyes, you could see it in his reads that he felt comfortable in the pocket. He was looking at the right areas. Intensely watching these play calls and how he was handling them, he ran the no-huddle very well."" Edelman believes  the quarterback competition really was about Jones being able to prove himself to Bill Belichick, as opposed to a straight-up battle with Cam Newton. ""I don't think he quite beat [Newton] out,"" Edelman said, ""but the ceiling is so high, they spent a 15th overall pick on the kid, they're going to go with him."" Edelman also said he felt bad for Newton, who started 15 games for the Patriots last year and was released Tuesday following five weeks of training camp. Edelman  played only six games with Newton last year before a knee injury knocked him out for the season  (and his career), but in Week 2 against Seattle, Newton and Edelman connected eight times for 179 yards, Edelman's career high. Edelman believes that Belichick didn't want Newton's big personality getting in the way of Jones establishing himself as the team's leader. ""It's terrible for Cam; I feel bad for him,"" Edelman said. ""But with that whole situation, I don't think they wanted a distraction. I think they wanted to give [Newton] his rein to go out and try to get another team."" Was Edelman surprised that the Patriots chose Jones and released Newton? ""Nothing surprises me with Bill,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chaim Bloom calls Red Sox' COVID outbreak 'gut-wrenching'  Link to Image Speaking with the media for the first time since his post-trade deadline availability on July 30, Red Sox chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom called the recent outbreak of positive COVID tests within the organization ""gut-wrenching."" FULL TEXT ""We try to go to great lengths to keep these things from happening, and then to see what's happening now, it's really hard. This goes beyond baseball,"" said Bloom. Bloom spoke shortly after it was learned that infielder Yairo Muñoz became the ninth member of the organization to test positive, and acknowledged that the team was uncertain why the outbreak occurred. ""I wish we knew. I think if we could pinpoint exactly why, it would have been easier to prevent. I don't know that we'll know exactly why,"" said Bloom. ""It's obviously something from Day 1 that we've been very concerned about, that we worried about. We've known it was possible, but I wish we knew exactly why it happened, and why it happened when it happened."" Bloom said a majority of the players who tested positive were breakthrough cases.  Bloom was asked if he was frustrated that not all players have been vaccinated. The team has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the league. ""Every person in this organization that isn't vaccinated, it pains me,"" said Bloom. ""In terms of this specific situation, we have a lot of breakthrough infections. There's no real way to know if it would have been different if we had a higher vaccination rate or not."" Bloom added that the Red Sox were expecting to play their game Wednesday as scheduled.

"URI faculty union says it's agreed to vaccination requirement ""Keeping the community safe and providing the best learning environment possible is our number one goal,"" Miriam Reumann, the president of the URI chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said Link to Image PROVIDENCE - The union representing faculty at the University of Rhode Island said Wednesday they've reached an agreement requiring all full-time faculty to get a COVID-19 vaccine unless they have a medical or religious exemption. FULL TEXT ""Keeping the community safe and providing the best learning environment possible is our number one goal,"" Miriam Reumann, the president of the URI chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said in an emailed statement. ""This agreement will protect students, staff, and faculty thereby enhancing the teaching, research, and service that are so beneficial to the entire state of Rhode Island."" URI, which has several other unions representing its workers, said it could not yet comment on the agreement with the faculty union. Classes at URI start Sept. 8. Public and private employers are now grappling with COVID-19 vaccine requirements as the Delta variant continues to complicate the pandemic picture in Rhode Island. One barrier is labor unions. While many union leaders say they broadly support COVID-19 vaccines, they also have sought protections for workers who do not wish to get vaccinated, and have also insisted that the rules be negotiated between labor and management. The result of a negotiation between URI and its faculty union was this, according to the union: All faculty must receive their final dose of COVID-19 vaccine by this coming Oct. 15. Also, members of the bargaining unit who are licensed health care providers have to follow Rhode Island Department of Health rules, which are slightly different. The deadline to request a medical or religious exemption is Oct. 1. And non-vaccinated faculty have to be tested in line with the university's testing protocols. ""The rapid intensification of COVID-19 spread in the past month has led us to request additional safety measures, and we're fortunate we could work with the University to provide this additional layer of protection."" Jay Walsh, the executive director of the URI chapter of the faculty union, said in an emailed statement. The public university is already requiring COVID-19 vaccines for undergraduate and graduate students, but is offering medical and religious exemptions for them too. All traditional colleges and universities in Rhode Island are imposing vaccine requirements on their students, according to a Boston Globe review as of late July. Some are also requiring faculty and staff to get vaccinated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"US faith groups unite to help Afghanistan refugees after war  Link to Image America's major religions and denominations, often divided on other big issues, have united behind the effort to help receive an influx of refugees from Afghanistan following the end of the United States' longest war and one of the largest airlifts in history. Among those gearing up to help are Jewish refugee resettlement agencies and Islamic groups; conservative and liberal Protestant churches; and prominent Catholic relief organizations, providing everything from food and clothes to legal assistance and housing. FULL TEXT ""It's incredible. It's an interfaith effort that involved Catholic, Lutheran, Muslim, Jews, Episcopalians, . . . Hindus, . . . as well as nonfaith communities who just believe that maybe it's not a matter of faith, but it's just a matter of who we are as a nation,"" said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and chief executive of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. The United States and its coalition partners have evacuated more than 100,000 people from Afghanistan since the airlift began Aug. 14, including more than 5,400 American citizens and many Afghans who helped the United States during the 20-year war. The effort by faith groups to help resettle them follows a long history of religious involvement in refugee policy, said Stephanie Nawyn, a sociologist at Michigan State University who focuses on refugee issues. Decades before the US Refugee Resettlement Program was created in 1980, faith organizations advocated for the resettlement of Jewish refugees during World War II. Religious groups also helped receive people who fled wars in Vietnam, the Balkans, and elsewhere. Besides helping distribute government resources, the groups mobilize private assets such as donations and volunteers and work with other private entities to provide supplies and housing, Nawyn said. US resettlement agencies were gutted under former president Donald Trump, who slashed refugee admissions yearly until they reached a record low. Now agencies are scrambling to expand capacity so they can handle the influx from Afghanistan. ""It's a historic effort, and there are and have been challenges - especially after rebounding from four years of what was a war on immigration, which decimated the refugee resettlement infrastructure,"" O'Mara Vignarajah said. ""Some of our local offices might have resettled 100 families throughout the entirety of last year, and they may now be looking at 100 families in the next few weeks,"" she said. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic Charities, and other agencies have been welcoming Afghan families at US military bases where they're being housed temporarily. A major challenge is finding affordable housing in areas where Afghans have typically resettled, including California and the Washington, D.C., region. ""I'm very concerned about children, getting them into schools,"" said Bill Canny, executive director of the USCCB's Migration and Refugee Services program. World Relief, a global Christian humanitarian organization, has helped resettle about 360 Afghans in the past month and is expecting many more, said Matthew Soerens, the group's US director of church mobilization. ""These are individuals in many cases who have put their lives at risk and their families' lives at risk for the people of the United States of America,"" he said. ""Now that they're facing the risk of retribution and retaliation from the Taliban, . . . I think most Americans of all religious traditions see it as a moral imperative for us to keep our promise."" Among the evacuees are Afghans who obtained special immigrant visas after working with the United States or NATO as interpreters or in some other capacity; people who have applied for the visas but not yet received them; and those who might have been particularly in danger under the Taliban. But thousands of others who also qualified for visas have been left behind because of a backlog of applications, and faith-based groups have called on President Biden's administration to get them safely to the United States. ""Some of the cases we are involved with have gotten out, but many have not,"" said Mark Hetfield, president and chief executive of the Jewish refugee agency HIAS, one of nine groups that contract with the State Department on resettlement. ""We have a girl who was literally shot by the Taliban and is now severely disabled who can't get out,"" he said. ""We are aware of many, many others who are trapped - and the US has left them behind."" Biden says he has tasked Secretary of State Antony Blinken to coordinate with international partners to hold the Taliban to their promise of safe passage for those who want to leave in the days ahead. The president has historically supported receiving refugees, cosponsoring legislation that created the government's program in 1980. This June, for World Refugee Day, Biden said that ""resettling refugees helps reunite families, enriches the fabric of America, and enhances our standing, influence, and security in the world."" Ardiane Ademi, director of the Refugee Resettlement Program for Catholic Charities in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, said it recently resettled several families who left Afghanistan before the airlift and is bracing for hundreds more. John Koehlinger, executive director of Kentucky Refugee Ministries, said his agency has received two families through the special immigrant visa program and has begun receiving additional evacuees. But other families the agency had been expecting have not yet arrived. ""Hopefully some or all of them are on a US military base being processed,"" he said. Ademi and Koehlinger said individuals and local congregations have volunteered to help with resettlement. Some have worked with refugees before, while others are newcomers motivated by the desperate news out of Afghanistan. ""It's a huge response,"" Ademi said. The humanitarian arm of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been providing personal hygiene items, underwear, sandals, and toys to refugees at an air base in Qatar, church spokesman Doug Anderson said. Widely known as the Mormon church, it has also been distributing supplies to the thousands of Afghans temporarily sheltered at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. And it is working with the US military to provide aid to the 10,000 refugees expected to arrive at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin, from where they will be relocated in communities across the country. Hala Halabi, national director of refugee facilitation for the Islamic Circle of North America Relief USA, said Muslim Americans have been flooding the group with calls, emails, and text messages offering to make donations, mentor refugees ,or prepare welcome boxes. The nonprofit recently furnished three apartments in the Dallas area with everything from the ""doormat to the food in the fridge,"" Halabi said, and is collecting supplies from pots and microwaves to pasta, sugar, and cleaning agents as it prepares for additional arrivals. Beyond the response from Muslim Americans, Halabi said she is heartened by how different faith groups have mobilized to help refugees: ""It's amazing from everybody.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Judge conditionally approves Purdue Pharma opioid settlement  Link to Image A federal bankruptcy judge on Wednesday gave conditional approval to a sweeping, potentially $10 billion plan submitted by OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma to settle a mountain of lawsuits over its role in the opioid crisis that has killed a half-million Americans over the past two decades. Under the settlement reached with creditors including individual victims and thousands of state and local governments, the Sackler family will give up ownership of the company and contribute $4.5 billion but will be freed from any future lawsuits over opioids. FULL TEXT The drugmaker will be reorganized into a new company with a board appointed by public officials and will funnel its profits into government-led efforts to prevent and treat opioid addiction. Also, the settlement sets up a compensation fund that will pay some victims of drug addiction an expected $3,500 to $48,000 each. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain said Wednesday after speaking from the bench for more than six hours that he would approve the plan as long as two technical changes were made. If so, he said, he will formally enter the decision on Thursday. He said before his ruling that while he does not have ""fondness for the Sacklers or sympathy for them,"" collecting money from them through litigation would be complicated. The settlement comes nearly two years after the Stamford, Connecticut-based company filed for bankruptcy under the weight of some 3,000 lawsuits from states, local governments, Native American tribes, hospitals, unions and other entities. They accuse Purdue Pharma of fueling the crisis by aggressively pushing sales of its best-selling prescription painkiller. The Sacklers were not given immunity from criminal charges, though there have been no indications they will face any. State and local governments came to support the plan overwhelmingly, though many did so grudgingly, as did groups representing those harmed by prescription opioids. Nine states, Washington, D.C., Seattle and the U.S. bankruptcy trustee, which seeks to protect the nation's bankruptcy system, opposed the settlement, largely because of the protections granted to the Sackler family. At least some of them are expected to appeal. Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson quickly announced he would appeal the plan, calling it inadequate. The bankruptcy judge, based in White Plains, New York, had urged the holdouts to negotiate an agreement, warning that drawn-out litigation would delay getting settlement money to victims and the programs needed to address the epidemic. ""Bitterness over the outcome of this case is completely understandable,"" Drain said. ""But one also has to look at the process and the issues and risks and rewards and alternatives of continued litigation versus the settlement laid out in the plan."" He noted that the payout issue was mediated by Kenneth Feinberg, who oversaw the government's Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund. Most states have sued Purdue, claiming it aggressively marketed OxyContin, contributing to an opioid overdose and addiction epidemic that has been linked to more than 500,000 deaths in the U.S. Some of the deaths have been attributed to OxyContin and other prescription opioids, but most are from illicit forms of opioids such as heroin and illegally produced fentanyl. Opioid-linked deaths in the U.S. continued at a record pace last year, hitting 70,000. The crisis crushed the reputation of the Sackler family, major philanthropists whose name was once emblazoned on the walls of museums and universities around the world. With the settlement, family members who have owned the company will still be worth billions. Whether the deal provides enough accountability for the Sacklers was the most contentious question through the proceedings. Many state attorneys general and advocacy groups working on behalf of opioid victims pushed for the family members to pay more and initially fought against the liability waiver. They succeeded in boosting the amount the Sacklers would pay from a likely $3 billion to a guaranteed $4.5 billion over a decade. David Sackler, a former Purdue board member, had testified that family members would not accept the agreement unless it protected them from lawsuits. Otherwise, he said, the family would defend itself in litigation that could drag on for years, with the company's and the family's assets eaten up by lawyers' fees rather than used to help address the crisis. His father, Richard Sackler, a former Purdue president and board chairman, said under questioning that he, his family and the company did not bear responsibility for the opioid crisis. Drain noted that none of the four Sacklers who testified offered an explicit apology. ""A forced apology is not really an apology, so we will have to live without one,"" he said. One projection commissioned by a group of state attorneys general found that the family's wealth could rise from the current estimate of $10.7 billion to more than $14 billion by 2030 despite making payments under the settlement. That's because the family could continue to benefit from investment returns and interest payments as they make their gradual contributions under the deal. However, lawyers for Purdue and branches of the Sackler family disputed the assumptions used in the projection. The settlement also requires members of the Sackler family, who are scattered across the U.S., Britain and elsewhere in Europe, to get out of the opioid business worldwide. Several attorneys general won another provision that will create a massive public repository of company documents, including communications with lawyers that normally would be protected by attorney-client privilege. Purdue has said the settlement overall will be worth about $10 billion, a figure that includes the value of addiction treatment and overdose antidote drugs it is developing. The bankruptcy case is not the first time Purdue had faced legal trouble over the marketing of its prescription painkillers. The company pleaded guilty in 2007 to federal charges it misled regulators and others about the addiction dangers of OxyContin and agreed to pay more than $600 million in penalties. Last November, as part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, Purdue pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States and violating anti-kickback laws. Purdue's bankruptcy has been the highest-profile case in a complicated universe of opioid litigation. Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and the three largest U.S. drug distribution companies recently announced a settlement that could be worth up to $26 billion if state and local governments agree. Individual trials also remain, including one scheduled to start in October in Cleveland over the role pharmacies played in the crisis. Other trials have been held this year in California, New York and West Virginia, though verdicts have not yet been reached.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pope inadvertently quotes Putin to chide West's Afghan war  MADRID - Pope Francis has criticized the West's two-decade-long involvement in Afghanistan as an outsider's attempt to impose democracy - although he did it by citing Russian President Vladimir Putin while thinking he was quoting German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Asked during a radio interview aired Wednesday about the new political map taking shape in Afghanistan after the United States and its allies withdrew from the Taliban-controlled country following 20 years of war, the pope said he would answer with a quote that he attributed to Merkel, whom he described as ""one of the world's greatest political figures."" FULL TEXT ""It is necessary to put an end to the irresponsible policy of intervening from outside and building democracy in other countries, ignoring the traditions of the peoples,"" the pope said, using his own translation into Spanish. But the words were spoken last month by Putin in the presence of Merkel, during her visit to Moscow. During the meeting on Aug. 20, Putin scathingly criticized the West over Afghanistan, saying that the Taliban's rapid sweep over the country has shown the futility of Western attempts to enforce its own vision of democracy. At a news conference with Putin, Merkel conceded that the operation had failed in delivering a clear future for Afghans. ""We did not want to force any system on Afghanistan,"" Merkel told reporters. ""But we saw that millions of girls were glad to go to school and that women could participate. There are many in Afghanistan who are very, very unhappy about developments now."" Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, refused to comment directly on the pope's comments when asked on Wednesday, but he added that Merkel's position on Afghanistan was well known and repeated during a recent speech to the German parliament. The goal of no international terror attacks from Afghanistan since the military operation started in 2001 ""was achieved,"" Merkel told German lawmakers on Aug. 25: ""That was a concrete contribution to the safety of our country."" Although she acknowledged that the West's goals may have been too ambitious and cultural differences and corruption may have been underestimated, she also said that the mission in Afghanistan ""wasn't futile"" for the country's population, as it helped reduce child mortality, deliver drinking water and electricity to a majority of Afghans, and protected rule of law and the basic rights of women and others. Merkel said the analysis of what went wrong would take time and each international mission would need to be assessed on its own, but she added that ""we must not and won't forget Afghanistan, because even if it doesn't look like it in this bitter hour I'm convinced that no violence and no ideology will stop people's urge toward freedom, justice, and peace forever."" The Vatican didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the pope's interview with Spain's Cadena COPE, which took place Friday at his residence. The radio station owned by Spain's Catholic bishops' conference aired the talk on Wednesday and said that its content had been vetted by the pope himself. Francis also said that ""not all eventualities were taken into account"" in the departure of Western allies from Afghanistan. ""I don't know whether there will be a review or not [about what happened during the withdrawal], but certainly there was a lot of deception perhaps on the part of the new [Afghan] authorities,"" said the pope. ""I say deceit or a lot of naivety."" He said he believed that the Vatican's top diplomat was offering to engage in Afghanistan to make sure that locals don't suffer and called for Christians across the world to engage in ""prayer, penance, and fasting"" in the face of events in Afghanistan. In the interview, Francis addressed direct questions about his health for the first time since he underwent bowel surgery in early July. He said his body is adjusting well to the removal of part of his colon and that he can now eat whatever he wants and leads ""a totally normal life."" He said that he expected his trip to Slovakia and Hungary between Sept. 12-15 would be as busy as previous ones. He also has an upcoming tour taking him to Cyprus, Greece and Malta. The pope also said he was expecting to appear and speak at the U.N.-sponsored COP26 climate talks in November in Glasgow, Scotland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mount Tabor High School in Winston-Salem was on lockdown after the shooting but all other students were safe, according to Forsyth County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Christina Howell. Howell said the department was ""actively seeking the suspect"" but provided no further details immediately.

Christopher Johnson said his son told him that he heard the gunshots while in the school gym and students were told to hide because there was an active shooter on the campus. ""You see stuff like this in the media,"" said Johnson, whose son was still at the school awaiting transportation to a pickup point. ""It's scary to know that it actually reached out and touched you this time. My son's not a victim but he's part of this and he'll probably remember this forever.""

"Massachusetts town says it can't fire officer for Hitler pic  A Massachusetts select board in Williamstown ruled that it does not have the authority or grounds to fire the police officer that kept a photo of Adolf Hitler in his locker for two decades. FULL TEXT In a statement, the chair of the board, Andrew S. Hogeland said that even if the board had the authority to fire Officer Craig Eichhammer, a 31-year veteran of the department, the termination might not hold because other town officials do not see strong enough grounds for firing, The Berkshire Eagle reported. Civil rights groups have called for Eichhammer's termination. While the panel cannot fire Eichhammer, it said it found the photo highly offensive and the demands to fire the officer are valid. Last month, groups like the Berkshire County branch of the NAACP and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law both condemned the officer's actions and called for his termination, the newspaper said. The groups said the officer's decision to pin a photo of Hitler in the town's police station mimicked actions by hate groups and spread antisemitic rhetoric and views. Eichhammer has said he hung the photo to make fun of a fellow officer who resembled Hitler. The board's power is limited in these circumstances, Hogeland said. In the past, the board has only had the authority to fire town managers and police chiefs ""We understand, and agree, that an officer having a photo of Hitler in a police locker is unacceptable and is highly offensive to the community,"" Hogeland said.

"Naomi Osaka advances to third round when Olga Danilovic withdraws; Simona Halep also moves on  Link to Image NEW YORK - Defending champion Naomi Osaka advanced to the third round of the US Open on Wednesday when her opponent withdrew because of illness. Simona Halep and Garbiñe Muguruza also reached the third round, ending long stretches without success in Flushing Meadows for the two-time Grand Slam champions. They were among the few players to squeeze in victories early on a rainy afternoon, when play started late and then was suspended briefly on the outer courts. FULL TEXT Osaka had been scheduled to face Olga Danilovic of Serbia in the first match of the day at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Instead, the US Tennis Association moved the 12th-seeded Halep's match against Kristina Kucova into that spot. Halep won, 6-3, 6-1, to reach the third round for the first time since a quarterfinal appearance in 2016. She was knocked out in the first round in both 2017 and 2018 - the latter the first time the No. 1 seed lost in the first round of the US Open. But the No. 12 seed has made a strong return after missing the French Open and Wimbledon with a calf injury. ""Already it's a better result than when I was healthy, so it's a good thing to be in the third round here,"" she joked. The ninth-seeded Muguruza got past the second round of the US Open for the first time since 2017 when she beat Andrea Petkovic, 6-4, 6-2. She will play three-time US Open runner-up Victoria Azarenka. The No. 18 seed beat Jasmine Paolini, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1). ""I think it's going to be a very difficult match. I think she always plays great here,"" Muguruza said. ""I think that's the best. Just to go out there and play with people that are top level."" Halep and Muguruza - who have won the French Open and Wimblebon - played two of the only matches to start on time on a day when heavy rain was expected in the New York area. Puddles filled the grounds around the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, though rain had stopped as fans began to enter for the day session. The outside courts were empty while they were being dried so play could eventually start. Once they did, fifth-seeded Elina Svitolina beat Rebeka Masarova, 6-2, 7-5, and No. 20-seeded Ons Jabeur raced to a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Maria Camila Osorio Serrano in 53 minutes. Most other players on the outer courts had to wait out another delay during their matches, as fans raced for cover when rain returned. Osaka would have been going for her 17th straight victory in a Grand Slam match. After missing Wimbledon during a mental health break, she returned to the majors with a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Marie Bouzkova on Monday night. The two-time US Open champion hasn't lost a Grand Slam match since Coco Gauff beat her at the 2020 Australian Open. Danilovic wrote on Instagram that she was dealing with a viral illness unrelated to COVID-19. The 17-year-old Gauff was set for one of the featured matches of the day, facing 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens under the lights at Ashe. No. 5 seed Andrey Rublev eliminated Pedro Martinez in four sets but 15th-seeded Grigor Dimitrov, a semifinalist in the 2019 US Open, retired after losing two tiebreakers and trailing, 4-0, in the third against Alexei Popyrin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Infielder Yairo Muñoz joins list of Red Sox players to test positive for COVID  Link to Image Yairo Muñoz is the latest member of the Red Sox to test positive for COVID, according to manager Alex Cora, who revealed the news in an interview on WEEI on Wednesday. FULL TEXT ""We're scrambling right now roster-wise, making phone calls, and see what we're going to do,"" said Cora. ""We've just got to keep competing. I know it's hard from afar and all that, but we're still in the middle of the pennant race or the wild-card race and we've still got a shot, so we have to find a way."" Muñoz joins Hirokazu Sawamura, Xander Bogaerts, Kiké Hernández, Christian Arroyo, Matt Barnes, Martín Pérez, quality control coach Rámon Vázquez, and strength and conditioning coach Kiyoshi Momose as the ninth team member to have tested positive. Josh Taylor and first base coach Tom Goodwin have been deemed close contacts. Muñoz entered Tuesday night's game and played second base after Bogaerts was pulled from the game in the second inning when the Sox learned he had tested positive. Jonathan Aráuz started the game at second but shifted to shortstop in place of Bogaerts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maine man pleads guilty to fatally beating family members and grandparents' caretaker in Groton in 2017  Link to Image A Maine man accused of beating four people to death, including his mother and grandparents, in Groton in 2017 pleaded guilty Wednesday to murder charges in Lowell Superior Court, the Middlesex District Attorney's office said. FULL TEXT Orion Krause, 26, of Rockport, Maine, admitted in court that he used a baseball bat to beat his mother, 60-year-old Elizabeth Krause of Rockport, his grandparents, Elizabeth Lackey, 85, and Frank Lackey, 86, of Groton, and his grandparent's caretaker, Bertha Mae Parker, 68, of Tewksbury. Krause was sentenced to life in prison with parole eligibility in 25 years, prosecutors said.  ""The resolution of this case today in no way can erase the incalculable loss felt by the family and friends of these victims,"" District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a statement. ""Following the 2017 murder, the entire Groton community mourned the loss of Elizabeth and Frank Lackey, Elizabeth Krause and Bertha Mae Parker. We continue to have them in our thoughts today as this case comes to a close."" Orion Krause had traveled from Rockport to the Boston area on Sept. 7, 2017, and the next morning he called his mother to ask for a ride home. Elizabeth Krause, who feared her son was contemplating suicide, drove to Massachusetts to pick him up, and on their way back to Maine they stopped at her parent's home in Groton. Later in the afternoon, Orion Krause attacked his family and Parker with a baseball bat. He then wandered, naked and covered in mud, to a nearby home where he told a neighbor what he had done, officials said.  ""While this conviction doesn't change the horrific events that occurred on September 8, 2017, we hope that this verdict today provides the family some peace,"" Groton Police Chief Michael Luth said in a statement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gig workers question clears first hurdle before 2022 ballot Attorney General Maura Healey approves 17 ballot petitions Link to Image A controversial ballot question that could reshape the gig economy moved one step closer to appearing before Massachusetts voters on the 2022 ballot. On Wednesday, Attorney General Maura Healey certified 17 ballot petitions as meeting constitutional muster, including questions on voter identification, happy hour, the legal status of app-based drivers, and more. That's just the first hurdle of many: Proponents of each question still have to gather more than 80,000 signatures over the next few months, and, if the Legislature doesn't take action on the petitions, more than 13,000 additional signatures in the spring. It's a taxing, expensive process; many initiatives don't make the ballot after missing one or more requirement. And there's always the possibility that a lawsuit could keep a petition from reaching voters, especially for controversial measures like the gig workers question. FULL TEXT Thirteen initiatives were nixed in Healey's review, she announced, including several that had the backing of the Massachusetts Republican Party. One seeking ""to preserve the lives of children born alive,"" was rejected because, the agency said, ""its provisions are so ambiguous that it is impossible to determine, or inform potential voters of, the proposed law's meaning."" Healey's office also rejected one the party claimed targeted ""critical race theory,"" in part because ""it is inconsistent with the right to free speech."" Ballot petitions are reviewed under strict constitutional standards, the office said in a news release. They cannot infringe on protected constitutional rights and cannot pertain to subjects like religion or the power of the courts. Perhaps the most closely watched is the question on the legal classification of gig workers in Massachusetts. A coalition backed by tech companies such as Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Instacart seeks to keep classifying their drivers and deliverers as independent contractors, not employees, while offering them some new benefits. An opposing group, with support from large labor organizations, says those benefits are paltry compared with what drivers should already be getting under state law. The tech-backed coalition cheered Healey's decision Wednesday, providing reporters with statements from app-based workers who said they support the ballot question. ""We believe that Massachusetts voters will support what drivers are asking for: to remain independent contractors, in control of our own schedules, while gaining new benefits,"" said Brittney Woods of Boston, who drives with DoorDash. ""That flexibility and control is why we drive."" The labor-backed coalition opposing the ballot question, which earlier put out a legal memorandum asking Healey not to greenlight it, will ""carefully consider our litigation options,"" said coalition director Mike Firestone. ""The Uber/Big Tech ballot measure cheats workers, shields these massive companies from liability to customers, and makes Massachusetts taxpayers pick up the tab,"" Firestone said. Firestone previously served as Healey's chief of staff and her campaign manager. The measure has already spurred two formal complaints to state campaign finance authorities, with critics pointing the finger at proponents and proponents pointing right back again. That early mudslinging foreshadows what could well prove to be the ugliest, priciest ballot initiative fight in Massachusetts history, a battle with fronts in the courts and on the airwaves. In August, the labor-backed Coalition to Protect Workers' Rights - which opposes the ballot question - accused the tech-backed Coalition for Independent Work of raising and spending money without properly disclosing it. Days later, the tech-backed group fired back, asking state campaign finance authorities to investigate their rivals for improper disclosures of fund-raising and spending. Both coalitions have dismissed their rival's accusations as meritless. A spokesman for the state's Office of Campaign and Political Finance, Jason Tait, said the office does not confirm the existence of such complaints but does review each one that is submitted to the office. It's a fight that may sound familiar to California's Proposition 22, a similar measure that voters approved last year after tech companies spent $200 million successfully pushing it. A California court recently struck down Prop 22 as unconstitutional under that state's laws, a ruling that will be appealed and that does not have direct legal bearing on Massachusetts' version. Healey's staff decided that the ballot question passed legal muster even as their colleagues in another division of the attorney general's office actively sue Uber and Lyft, claiming they are violating state law by misclassifying drivers as independent contractors. Healey has said the two are entirely separate and her personal views do not inform the process of vetting ballot questions. The attorney general's office approved two versions of the gig workers ballot question. They are identical but for a provision included in only one version that would require drivers to undergo paid safety training sessions on topics like collision avoidance and sexual assault prevention. Proponents are moving ahead with both versions of the question, a spokesman said. Already expected to be on next fall's ballot: a constitutional amendment that would impose a 4 percent surtax on annual personal income above $1 million. That measure cleared its last procedural hurdle before the 2022 ballot in June, when overwhelming majorities in the Democratic-dominated Legislature backed it. Voters may also get the chance to opine on issues ranging from voter identification requirements to happy hours. Massachusetts banned happy hours in the 1980s after a series of drunk driving tragedies. Despite some movement at the Legislature, and widespread public support for bringing it back, Governor Charlie Baker has said he would ""be hard pressed to support changing it."" The ballot question seeks to permit happy hour drink specials. Another would require voters to present a government-issued photo ID before casting a ballot. Massachusetts does not ask voters to present identification at the polls, with some exceptions, such as for first-time voters. Voting rights advocates say that ID requirements are discriminatory against people of color and low-income voters, and are not intended to solve a legitimate public policy problem. A spokeswoman for the Secretary of State's Office said she is not aware of any recent voter fraud cases in Massachusetts. Healey declined to certify a petition seeking to ban teachers from presenting US history ""with the specific intent of making any such students feel personally responsible, at fault or liable, either individually or as a member of a racial or ethnic group, for the actions or omissions of others."" The Massachusetts GOP had claimed that that initiative would target ""critical race theory,"" though the phrase did not appear in the text itself. Critical race theory is an academic doctrine built on the idea that modern law and other institutions were shaped by historical patterns of racism that continue to disadvantage people of color and Black people in particular. Critics on the right have attempted to paint the theory with a broad brush, claiming it accuses all white Americans of racism and attempts to make students feel guilty for historical events they played no role in. A number of red states have passed laws banning ""critical race theory,"" limiting how educators can talk about the country's troubled racial history. In rejecting the initiative, agency staff wrote, ""read literally, a teacher could violate this proposed law based on their students' feelings in receiving instruction, and as a result, teachers' speech about 'our country's history' is chilled by this proposed law."" The state Republican party also slammed Healey for refusing to certify the ""born alive"" abortion-related petition, suggesting Healey's personal politics - she is a strong supporter of abortion rights - had come into play. The attorney general's office said it rejected the petition because it was ""ambiguous,"" an explanation the party scoffed at. ""Today's denial by AG Healey confirms the radical left has no problem eliminating medical care for babies born alive,"" GOP Chairman Jim Lyons said in a statement. ""The attorney general's failure to put her political views aside constitutes a dereliction of her duty.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
