1,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Football-Patriots,Wilfork goes out a legend,Lineman leaves Pats for Texans,JEFF HOWE,"Vince Wilfork will be immortalized as a Patriot, but like so many, he won't be a Patriots lifer. The seven-time captain and five-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman signed with the Texans yesterday after a positive two-day visit with the Houston brass. Wilfork landed a two-year, $9 million contract, which included $5 million in guaranteed money, according to a source. And so ends Wilfork's 11-year run with the Patriots. The 2004 first-round pick opened his reign by surging to the top of the defensive tackle depth chart and becoming a fierce contributor for a Super Bowl champion. His tenure concluded with another victory on the world's greatest stage, and he was vindicated after returning from a torn Achilles while continuing as the defense's most prominent leadership presence.","'Few players reached or will ever reach the special level of Vince Wilfork,' Pats coach Bill Belichick said. 'He is a great champion and one of the classiest people I have ever been around, just a kind, genuine and giving person who was all about our team, football, winning and bringing joy to others. There may have never been anyone at his position with as much strength, toughness, intelligence, instinctiveness and athleticism. He is the best defensive lineman I ever coached, an all-time great Patriot whose place on our team will be missed but whose remarkable career as a Patriot will be remembered forever.' Wilfork was expected to take his time on the free agent circuit, but there was an obvious connection to Texans coach Bill O'Brien, defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel and linebackers coach Mike Vrabel, all former Patriots employees. He will now play alongside Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt and last year's No. 1 overall draft pick, Jadeveon Clowney. So, Wilfork made the quick decision after his first tour, spurning supposed interest from AFC contenders such as the Colts and Ravens. The Patriots declined Wilfork's option on March 5 for the 2015 and 2016 seasons, which saved $8 million against the cap in 2015. But because Wilfork never closed the door on a return in his initial statement and the Patriots hadn't acknowledged the transaction until last night, there was a popular belief the two sides could still indeed reunite. They mended fences after much more contentious negotiations in 2009, 2010 and 2014, and this split seemed amicable. 'I've been very blessed and privileged to play up there and learn from the best coach that has ever done it,' Wilfork said. 'Also, to play with one of the best quarterbacks that's in the game. From my teammates, there's nothing but love for them. They are brothers to me. The fans always treated me with respect. We had a lot of fun. I had a lot of fun in New England, and I'm going to cherish all of that. Because at the end of the day, I've been there for 11 years, so it's hard to close that door on my teammates, my fans, my coaches and the owner.' Wilfork is a shoo-in for the Patriots Hall of Fame, and those in and around the team fondly will remember the classy way he handled the past two weeks. Of course, Wilfork won't go wire-to-wire as a Patriot, just like Ty Law, Willie McGinest, Lawyer Milloy, Richard Seymour and Logan Mankins before him. The business side can often be football's reaper. Belichick has roamed NFL sidelines for 40 years, and he proclaimed to have never coached a defensive lineman better than Wilfork. That timeless impression will spark everlasting memories of Vince Wilfork.",['ENGLISH'],576,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

2,"Newspaper, Newspapers",OPINION,Commentary,Hillary's modus operandi not pretty,'Nasty' GOP latest excuse for private email use,JENNIFER C. BRACERAS,"Just when you thought we were done with emailgate, along comes James Carville to shed light on the matter. In defending Hillary Clinton's decision to use a private server for her emails, Carville on ABC's 'This Week' Sunday justified Clinton's actions as a 'reasonable' means of preventing the Republican Congress from 'rifling through her emails.' Wait. Rewind the tape.","Didn't Clinton tell us that she set up the private server to avoid carrying two devices? And now Carville claims that she did it to hide from those nasty Republicans? Which is it? Clinton's excuse - that she sought to avoid fumbling with two phones - is laughable. Any kid can tell you that a single device is capable of displaying emails from multiple accounts and that professionals routinely set up their hand-held devices to do just that. Carville's excuse - that it is the GOP's fault - is classic Clintonian finger-pointing. By insinuating that Republicans have some sort of prurient interest in emails between Bill and Hillary Clinton, Carville makes Clinton's actions seem rational. After all, who among us would want our private communications spilled to the world?   But Carville's suggestion that Republican lawmakers were on some dystopian quest to monitor Clinton's private life is not only paranoid, but historically inaccurate - at the time Clinton set up her account on the private server, Democrats (not Republicans) controlled both houses of Congress (and thus the ability to subpoena State Department records). In truth, GOP lawmakers have not questioned Clinton's decision to use a private email account for truly private emails. Everyone does that. They have, however, raised questions about Clinton's decision to conduct government business on a private server - a server designed to keep things secret. (When did Hillary Clinton decide to become not just the secretary of state but the secretary of IT?) Carville's comments, while intended to hurt Republicans, inadvertently reveal the truth: Clinton created the account to avoid congressional oversight. (As part of its long-established authority to oversee federal agencies, Congress has every right to review government emails.) Upon becoming secretary of state, Clinton could have chosen to use a government email account for all communications. More appropriately, she could have chosen to use the government email for work matters and a separate private account for personal matters. She chose neither approach. Instead, Clinton set up a private server - not for administrative simplicity, but for political expedience. Clinton could not have known at that time what controversies lay ahead. But controversies she knew there would be. So she took measures to protect herself, knowing that when her decision to hide her emails eventually came to light, she could fall back on 'administrative convenience' and count on her ol' friend James Carville to blame any criticism of her Highness on the 'vast right-wing conspiracy.' This, of course, is strategy No. 1 in the Clinton playbook: Protect your political future at all costs, even if you have to break a few rules. After all, rules are technicalities that apply only to little people, not to the enlightened few who are destined to make the world a better place. That Clinton later instructed her minions to delete all so-called personal emails proves that her motive was not administrative but the avoidance oversight. Why, if one had a personal and secure server would one bother to delete all allegedly personal emails? The only plausible explanation is so that nobody can challenge whether those emails are, in fact, strictly personal. This controversy is about more than just transparency. It's about the character and modus operandi of HRC. And it's not pretty. Jennifer C. Braceras is a lawyer and political commentator.

3,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Basketball-College Men,Coen brings NU up to speed on ND,,TOM LAYMAN,"Pulling Bill Coen away from basketball is a tough thing to do. While his team waited, and waited, for Sunday's NCAA tournament selection show to come around, the Northeastern men's basketball coach decided to watch some of the other conference tourneys after his Huskies had wrapped up the Colonial Athletic Association's automatic bid, knowing there was a possibility he would have to game-plan for one of the teams. Like many, Coen tuned in to a Duke game and watched a team steamroll one of the power teams in the country. Then, a day later, he watched that same team pick apart North Carolina like it was standing still with a 24-2 run in the second half to win the ACC tournament. That team was Notre Dame. ","Coen picked the right team to view.  The 14th-seeded Huskies will have to figure out how to slow down third-seeded Notre Dame on Thursday in the second round of the NCAA tournament in Pittsburgh. 'Coach (Mike) Krzyzewski hasn't figured it out (for Duke) and (North Carolina's) Roy Williams hasn't figured it out. I don't know if I can figure it out by Thursday,' Coen said jokingly yesterday after practice at the Cabot Center. 'It's going to take our best. . . . We are going to need guys to have multiple efforts on every possession. Guys are going to have to help guys. Guys are going to have to shrink the floor and then recover to shooters, box out the weakside. We are going to need maximum effort to cover the floor.' The Irish are one of the most complete offensive teams in the tournament, with Pat Connaughton (Arlington/St. John's Prep), Jerian Grant, Steve Vasturia and Demetrius Jackson all able to beat defenders with the dribble to score or create opportunities for others. Notre Dame was second in the ACC in scoring average (78.5) and led the conference in field goal percentage (50.9) and 3-point percentage (38.9). In three of their past four games, the Irish have managed to shoot 50 percent or better from the field. '(It's about) being in a stance at all times and being prepared,' Northeastern redshirt junior swingman Quincy Ford said of defending against Notre Dame. 'We have to be ready to defend and want to win.' The best way for the Huskies to take the steam out of the Irish is to limit their possessions. When they have the ball, the Huskies will need to pass it around and use up clock. The more time Northeastern spends on offense, the less opportunities on the other end for Notre Dame. Turnovers have led to problems for the Huskies. Coen understands that carelessness with the basketball will lead to bad things for his team. He watched what the Irish did to North Carolina when the Tar Heels got sloppy with the ball in the ACC title game. 'You cannot turn the ball over against them,' Coen said. 'They are elite, maybe the best team, in transition. They play three, four, even five guards at one time. Their frontcourt players can all put the ball down. If they get a steal anywhere they can all dribble, finish and make a play. That is going to be a major emphasis for us. We have to be near a season low in turnovers in order to compete.'",['ENGLISH'],513,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

4,"Newspaper, Newspapers",OPINION,Editorials,Keep off the grass,,,The devil is - as it has always been - in the details of the Boston 2024 Olympic effort. Now the planning process has come under attack on two fronts. And all the ex-Patrick administration folks on the payroll can't set things right if those details remain on the far side of lunatic.,"Yesterday the head of the House Transportation Committee, Bill Strauss (D-Mattapoisett), issued a statement calling on Boston 2024 to provide details on its final decisions on venues and come up with the money for an independent review of the impact and the cost to the public sector. 'I do not want to see the public left out of the discussion by only learning in mid-September of this year where Boston 2024 is intending to locate specific events,' Strauss said. His comments come just days after the respected Friends of the Public Garden announced their opposition to use of the Boston Common for beach volleyball and parts of the Public Garden itself for ancillary uses as a path to the marathon and road cycling events. Despite the fact that the beach volleyball idea with its 16,000-seat stadium sounded like a bad joke, the Common has, of course, hosted lots of large public gatherings - not 16,000-seat large - but substantial. But we're frankly grateful for the work of the Friends, who raise substantial amounts of money and donate thousands of man hours to keeping both parks the wonderful places that they are, for getting under the hood of the Olympics proposal. Because the bottom line is that it is simply horrifying. The beach volleyball plan calls for the removal of 50 mature trees on the Common, the board said in an announcement posted on its website. Putting a security fence around an area they calculate at some 32 acres for a construction timeline estimated at seven months would mean 'mostly likely the areas impacted would be unavailable for as long as a year including post-event restoration.' Thus displacing some 35,000 people who 'use this as their neighborhood park and many thousands more from every neighborhood and beyond Boston [who] use it for various forms of recreation and civic gathering. ... This use would reverse centuries of tradition.' It would be easy to accuse the Friends of the Public Garden of simply being guilty of that old 'not in my backyard' syndrome. But the fact remains that the Common and the Public Garden are treasures beloved by locals and sought out by tourists. What is the point of hosting an Olympics if it puts off-limits to non-ticket holders the very heart of the real Boston? And that's what this most foolish part of the Boston 2024 effort proposes to do.",['ENGLISH'],433,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

5,"Newspaper, Newspapers",FEATURES,Movies-Movie News,Elgort runs toward new challenge with 'Insurgent',,STEPHEN SCHAEFER / MOVIES,"LOS ANGELES - A year after his breakthrough success as cancer patient Gus in 'The Fault in Our Stars,' Ansel Elgort returns to his role as Caleb, brother of Tris (Shailene Woodley) in the 'Divergent' sequel 'Insurgent.'","'It's a big franchise so that's nice, and it's something dramatically totally different from Gus,' said Elgort (21 as of last Saturday). As the first film ended, Caleb and Tris saw their mother and father killed; 'Insurgent' finds them traumatized and on the run. The siblings, he said during a one-on-one interview at the Four Seasons hotel, 'change a lot.'  That's an understatement - Caleb abandons his protective sister and her lover Four (Theo James) to return to the scarily powerful leader Jeanine, played by Kate Winslet. Does he become a villain? 'No! He makes that decision because he thinks they're wrong. They want to start a war, assassinate Jeanine. He thinks they're crazy.    'He thinks, 'What is going on? I can't be a part of this. I'm not cut out for this.' You see the way he's running? He can't keep up with them, he's not that type of guy. He's not a Dauntless' - the warrior faction.    'Caleb's an Erudite' - the brainy, scientific faction of biochemists, doctors - 'and as an Erudite, he's looked up to Jeanine for so long he's sort of been brainwashed by her.   'He thinks Jeanine will lead them to peace and not let war happen. If that means getting rid of a few Divergents' - which would include his sister - 'that's fine.' Elgort relished the chance to look gawky and geeky as he lags behind the film's heroic couple, Tris and Four. 'Caleb's more of a character role inside an action film. He's not an action hero. I wanted to represent the intellectual who maybe wouldn't be a good runner. 'The problem with these movies sometimes is everyone is a ... superhero. And he's not. And it wouldn't make sense for him to be running perfectly and then to say, 'I'm not cut out for this.' 'For me, I'm a very physical guy, I rock climb and play basketball. If you watch the film, the way Caleb runs, he looks like he will trip over something. So it was a conscious decision.'  ('Insurgent' opens Friday.)",['ENGLISH'],355,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

6,"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,Retail,RETAILERS FEAR TRASHED STREETS,Mess left beneath snow piles could slow return to normal,MARIE SZANISZLO,"With dirty snowbanks still lining many streets, Boston is looking at another month or more of grit, dirt and litter before the city begins street sweeping, leaving many businesses worried that all of the trash left behind by melting snow will turn off local customers and tourists.","'After this very tough winter for main streets, it is vital consumers be encouraged and welcomed back into our local stores and restaurants,' said Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts. 'Easter is April 5, and the spring shopping season has begun. The sooner the snow is gone, the streets are clean, all parking is back, and consumers feel like they can go downtown, not just to the mall, the better. A pleasant shopping environment is important to attract consumers who have mall and Internet options.' At a City Council hearing yesterday on the city's spring cleanup and street-sweeping strategy, Interim Public Works Commissioner Michael Dennehy said with all the snow that is still left, beginning street sweeping on the annual start date - April 1 - will likely be an 'impossibility.' So it's been postponed until curbs and gutters are free of ice and snow, Bonnie McGilpin, a spokeswoman for Mayor Martin J. Walsh, said, and the mayor's office will notify residents when street cleaning will resume once a date is finalized. In the meantime, McGilpin said, cars that park on the sides of a street that is posted for cleaning on certain weekdays beginning April 1 will not be ticketed. As the record 108.6 inches of snow that hammered Boston this winter melts, the city has been 'stuck with incredible amounts of trash,' Councilor Matt O'Malley said. 'We have to do better with trash pickup in the business districts, especially on the main streets,' said Michael Reiskind of Jamaica Plain Shines, an anti-litter campaign launched by the Jamaica Plain Business and Professional Association. Since last week alone, crews have hauled away about 200 tons of debris, Dennehy said. And from May 5, 2014, to last Friday, the city issued 58,000 tickets to people for putting trash out on the wrong day - compared to 38,000 tickets over the same period a year earlier - 'to deter bad behavior,' he said. 'Mayor Walsh and his team are doing everything they can to clear the streets of both snow and debris as quickly as possible,' said Paul Guzzi, president and CEO of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce.

Afraid of hurting her loved ones, Liv dumps her fiance and spends the next six months essentially zoning out in front of the TV, becoming a different kind of zombie, a slacker. She reluctantly takes a job in the coroner's office, where it is almost an all-you-can-eat brains buffet. There, she discovers a few surprises. Her colleague, Dr. Ravi Chakrabarti (Rahul Kohli), guesses her secret - and is eager to help her find a cure for her condition. And whenever she eats the brains of murder victims, she experiences flashes of memory that she passes on to Detective Clive Babineaux (Malcolm Goodwin, 'Breakout Kings') to solve the crime. She tells him she's a psychic. He doesn't believe her - until her clues prove to be solid.  Another side effect of her new diet: She picks up the personality traits of the deceased. Next week, as she investigates the murder of an artist who had several lovers, she finds herself unwittingly, hilariously getting frisky with all sorts of the wrong people.  'iZombie' is superbly cast and displays wit and surprises you don't often find in the comics-to-TV genre (cough, 'Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,' cough). Series co-creator Rob Thomas ('Veronica Mars') knows something about creating lovable female detectives. McIver seems to be adept at everything. Kohli has terrific timing. Buckley finally has a role that allows him to show his range at both comedy and drama. He's devastating next week as Liv's personality flips wreak havoc on his heart.  The gore level, in case  you're wondering, is so minor, it's almost negligible. You see more on 'Grey's Anatomy.' The murder mysteries, however, could be better developed. Tonight's is settled by one of the worst cliches in TV procedurals. To the show's credit, however, the mystery behind the zombie who attacked Liv takes a huge leap next week.  'iZombie' really is about one woman finding her determination to live again, regardless of her affliction. Not a bad premise for a show about a brain-muncher.",['ENGLISH'],502,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

8,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Baseball-Red Sox,Sox see what's missing,Harvey shows off top-of-rotation arm,JASON MASTRODONATO,"FORT MYERS - It's not just the results, the confidence, the poise, the give-me-the-ball, I'm-not-going-to-lose attitude. It's all of that, combined into one.  Matt Harvey has it.","The Red Sox don't have a Matt Harvey, and they received a good reminder of that yesterday for four innings by one of baseball's best pitchers. 'If (the New York Mets) want to give him up, we'd certainly welcome him,' Sox manager John Farrell said jokingly. Against the Red Sox' best, Harvey, in his second start since missing all of last season following October 2013 elbow surgery, was better. 'He looked good,' David Ortiz said after going 0-for-2 against Harvey. 'His slider - powerful.' In a playoff-like at-bat in the third inning, Harvey threw a high-90s heater up in the strike zone to Dustin Pedroia, then came back with a 3-2 changeup that disappeared before it reached the plate and made the former AL MVP look like a minor league extra, if just for one horribly sloppy swing. 'He's a great guy,' Harvey said. 'It was a fun battle.' Harvey's changeup was 88 mph. 'He got me,' said Pedroia. 'He looked great.' Harvey was dominant, shutting out the Red Sox while holding a lineup full of regulars to three hits over four innings. He struck out three and his fastball touched 94 mph in the first inning, 97 in the second and 98 in the third. And then there's the changeup, the curveball and the slider. 'To see the power and the shape to secondary pitches - he's a heck of a pitcher,' Farrell said. Pitchers like Harvey are the reason why Clay Buchholz had to go out and make T-shirts that say, 'He's the ACE,' for every starter in the Red Sox rotation. None of the Sox starters have taken the step that Harvey has, from passed-over high school pitcher (23 were taken ahead of him in the 2007 draft), to college mop-up man during his second year at North Carolina, to first-round draft pick in 2010, to Cy Young contender. 'There are only a few guys in that caliber,' pitching coach Juan Nieves said recently of staff aces. 'Everybody else falls into that lower one just underneath that.' Once quoted in Sports Illustrated as saying, 'I want to be that guy when they know you're starting against them, they go, 'Oh crap,' ' Harvey's persona fits with his career 2.39 ERA. But he's also aware that one pitcher won't win a World Series. The Mets are far from playoff favorites, even in an NL East that should provide plenty of opportunities to win. New York isn't a longshot, either, because of their starting pitching depth. 'I think if you look at all of our guys, they could be aces,' Harvey said. 'I think once Opening Day is out of the way, the whole ace thing isn't really in our minds. It's nice when you're considered an ace and facing an ace because you have to work harder and try to outduel them. For that, it's special.' In Buchholz, Rick Porcello or Justin Masterson, maybe even Wade Miley or Joe Kelly, who left yesterday's start in the third inning with biceps soreness, the Red Sox have pitchers capable of putting up a sub-3.00 ERA. Buchholz has been there before, if only for short stints, and he's looked the part of a No. 1 this spring. Or the Red Sox, with plenty of financial flexibility and prospects to move, could try to make a trade. With the class of talented starting pitchers that might be available in July, there will be plenty of options. But there are only a few guys like Matt Harvey.

Believe it or not, Spandex-Americans are seeking to become a protected class.","I thought they already were! These sweaty, trust-funded, unshaven (of both sexes) cultists want to legally define their precious selves as 'vulnerable road users.' Of course, as cover, they also throw in cops, pedestrians, tow-truck drivers and other more sympathetic figures, but it's all about them. Kind of like they behave on the streets, right? And now they want more special perks. Haven't we already bestowed on bicyclists their own road version of affirmative action? It's called running red lights with impunity. Pick a road, any road. Comm. Ave. around Boston University, Harvard Street in Brookline or my favorite, Mass. Ave. in Cambridge. If you drive from Harvard Square to the Arlington line, you have to go through close to 10 traffic lights. Here's what happens on Mass. Ave. to the truly vulnerable road users - motorists. The driver approaches a bicyclist who is hogging the right lane. The driver has to slow down until traffic passes on the left. Then he passes the Beautiful Person on his $8,999 Scott Plasma Premium. Often the bicyclist gives the motorist a salute - a one-finger salute. A few streets further west, the next light on Mass. Ave. turns red. The motorist stops, but the bicyclist he has just passed cruises right through the light, in complete violation of the law, and is once again ahead of the motorist. The light turns green and the motorist closes in on the bicyclist who has just run a red light. Once again, the motorist slows, waits for a chance to get around the bicycle, guns the car and tries to get through the next light as it turns yellow, but can't make it. And the bicyclist cruises past him again on the right. Stop at a traffic light? I'm wearing Spandex, pal, I don't need to obey no stinkin' laws. These bicyclists want rights but no responsibilities. Who do they think they are, illegal aliens? If bicyclists want equal rights, let them pay equal taxes. Excise taxes, registration fees, inspections, etc. Have the Legislature pass a tax automatically increasing the tax every year on air pumps. One quote from these Lance Armstrong groupies: 'For too long, bicyclists have been simply tolerated instead of welcomed and protected in Massachusetts.'

10,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Basketball-College Men,Try to find method for Madness,,TOM LAYMAN,"There's no better feeling than filling out a bracket before one game has been played in the NCAA tournament. The hope and the chance to capture all the glory (and money) in a bracket pool is there for the taking on a clean sheet (or screen) full of potential winners. That is, before all the red comes out when games start getting played.","There is no foolproof way to pick a bracket. Some people ask their grandmother or Timmy the neighborhood stat savant. Some get their dog to pick food out of bowls with team names on them. And there's always the method of picking your favorite uniforms or mascots. It doesn't matter how many games you've seen or how much 'studying' has been done. The brackets always win. But here are a few tidbits to make picking the games a little more fun: ·   Kentucky is the considerable favorite to win the national championship. But did you know that if the Wildcats run into Maryland or Notre Dame, some Massachusetts kids will get a chance to pull off a stunning upset? Maryland would face Kentucky in the Sweet 16, and that would give Wrentham's Jake Layman a shot a the spotlight. Barring upsets, a Kentucky-Notre Dame matchup is possible in the Elite Eight. The Irish have Arlington's Pat Connaughton, New Bedford's Bonzie Colson and Marlboro's Zach Auguste. It would be interesting to see if the local kids could slay Goliath and end the undefeated season. ·   Speaking of local, Harvard and Northeastern got tough draws in the second round (the first round involves only the four play-in games during the next two nights). The Crimson get a resurgent North Carolina team, while the Huskies attempt to derail one of the hottest teams in the country, Notre Dame. Maybe Northeastern could even get a shot at Kentucky with a Cinderella run. A win by either Boston team would be a pretty big upset. ·   Everybody has a team they never will pick again after being wronged in the past. For me, it's Georgetown, hands down. In the 2010 tournament, Greg Monroe and the Hoyas earned the No. 3 seed in the Midwest Regional after making believers out of everyone with a run to the Big East tourney championship game. But they lost to 14th-seeded Ohio and were done before their championship journey, at least in my bracket, could get started. Georgetown is the No. 4 seed in the South this time around and will try to hold off a 26-win Eastern Washington team. Think upset, and it's not personal. ·   Upsets are tough to pick. That's whey they are called upsets. But you have to pick one or two teams to do something that probably isn't predicted by the pundits. That's what makes the tournament great. For me, Stephen F. Austin could make a run to the Sweet 16 as a No. 12 seed because of its offensive firepower. Providence will have to wait for the winner of Boise State-Dayton, potentially play a virtual road game in Ohio vs. the Flyers, then beat third-seeded Oklahoma to get to the Sweet 16. It can happen. ·   Most of the heavyweights should be playing as the bracket starts to get smaller. The upper-echelon teams were so steady that seven teams were in the hunt for No. 1 seeds down the stretch. The best game of the tournament before the Final Four could be an Elite Eight matchup between Wisconsin and Arizona in the West. A dream scenario for a lot of defensive purists would be to see Kentucky and Virginia try to reach 50 points against each other in the national championship game.",['ENGLISH'],569,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

11,"Newspaper, Newspapers",BUSINESS,Real Estate,Architect rips plan to fill in 500 Boylston courtyard,,DONNA GOODISON,An original architect of 500 Boylston St. in Boston's Back Bay took aim at owner Equity Office Properties' plans to infill the building's 'underutilized' courtyard with a five-story retail and office addition.,"'It's a bad idea,' said John Burgee, who designed the award-winning 1989 building with esteemed architect Philip Johnson. Renderings haven't been released, but Burgee said the addition 'sounds like a blocking idea to fill up space. It puts a plug into (an) open space and obviously to maximize profit.' The existing building, which shares a full block with 222 Berkeley St., has a 19-story office tower atop a six-story retail/office base. 'The idea of the court was to make it feel like you were on Boylston Street as you entered the building beyond, so to block that with another building is defeating the purpose,' Burgee said. Equity also plans to convert 50,000 square feet of office space at 500 Boylston into retail, according to a letter filed with the city. Two new vestibules at 222 Berkeley's entrance would provide access to its second floor and 8,350 square feet of office space slated to become restaurant space. Equity said the changes would 'improve the retail experience and street edge' on Boylston Street and improve the pedestrian connection between Berkeley and Clarendon streets.  The project is a 'reflection of our belief in this terrific building and the overall strength of the Boston market,' senior vice president John Conley said.

We find it astonishing that police departments can now withhold the names of officers charged with serious crimes such as drunken driving. Reform is long overdue. Journalists and citizens seeking public information are hampered by government agencies that respond slowly and incompletely (if at all) to their requests. Outrageously high fees for information and the lack of meaningful enforcement provisions add to the difficulties of obtaining documents. The Massachusetts Freedom of Information Alliance is calling for immediate action. It would be fitting if the Legislature and governor could agree on needed reforms this week, which is Sunshine Week, an annual celebration of open government.

This was a misguided attempt to shape American foreign policy and undermine negotiations with Iran.  The organizer of the letter, U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ariz.) seems to want talks with Iran to fail. But diplomacy offers the best chance to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. This would resolve one of America's greatest national security concerns. Congress should not allow Cotton's attempts to derail the talks to succeed. Lawmakers should let the president do his job - and oppose legislation that gets in the way of negotiations.

14,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Cops give riveting firefight details,Shed light on a.m. battle with Tsarnaevs,LAUREL J. SWEET,The showdown with the bomb-tossing Tsarnaev brothers in Watertown brought everyone in federal court in Boston to the edge of their seats yesterday as police told of the face-to-face firefight.,"Watertown police Sgts. Jeffrey Pugliese and John MacLellan, along with patrolman Joseph Reynolds, said they found themselves in the Tsarnaevs' crosshairs when the brothers, fleeing an armed carjacking and the murder of MIT police officer Sean Collier, drew police into an ambush on Laurel Street in Watertown in the early-morning hours of April 19, 2013. 'We were about 6 to 8 feet at most from each other,' Pugliese, a firearms instructor, said of his confrontation with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who charged at the officer from the cover of a stolen Mercedes-Benz SUV. 'My pistol ran out of ammunition, and I had to reload in the middle of this battle. He was having problems with his (Ruger). I don't know if it jammed or ran out of ammunition. He looked at his gun, he looked at me, we looked at each other. I think out of frustration he threw the gun at me and it hit me in the left bicep,' Pugliese said. Leaving his then-19-year-old brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev behind crouching next to the Benz, Tamerlan ran straight at MacLellan and Reynolds, Pugliese said, but he tackled him to the ground facedown. 'The three of us were trying to get handcuffs on Tamerlan,' Pugliese said. 'I could hear an engine racing, and I saw the headlights moving toward me. It was accelerating at a very high rate of speed.' Dzhokhar, according to the officers, had gotten behind the wheel of the SUV and made a three-point turn.  'I reached down and grabbed Tamerlan by the back of the belt and I was trying to drag him out of the street. I was able to pull him about a foot,' Pugliese said. Finally heeding MacLellan's and Reynolds' screams for him to save himself, Pugliese recreated how he threw himself backward just as Dzhokhar ran over his brother.  'The front wheels went over Tamerlan. He got bounced up into the undercarriage,' he said. 'The vehicle dragged him about 35 to 40 feet. Tamerlan was hung up in the rear wheels.' As Reynolds fired a shot through the windshield, Tamerlan came loose as his brother plowed into Reynolds' empty cruiser, and then fled from the mayhem, later abandoning the SUV at Spruce and Lincoln streets. Tamerlan later died.  It was only after Dzhokhar vanished across the intersection with Dexter Avenue that investigators discovered responding transit police officer Richard 'Dic' Donohue bleeding to death in a driveway on Dexter from a stray bullet to his groin. Dr. Heather Studley, who treated Donohue at South Shore Hospital's emergency room, said he lost all 10 quarts of his blood and was technically dead for 45 minutes before being miraculously revived through transfusions, CPR and medication.

15,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Cruz slams amnesty to illegals,,,"U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, spoke with Boston Herald Radio's Holly Robichaud yesterday about his possible presidential run: Q: Great job up in New Hampshire. Are they loving you out there?","A: I'll tell you that the reception we received in New Hampshire has really been breathtaking. We've had standing-room-only crowds. ... It has been really encouraging. There's a lot of enthusiasm. People are hungry for a leader who is willing to tell the truth and stand up and do what he said he would do.  Q: Here in Massachusetts there's a lot of us worried about the illegal immigration problem, and now we got the president's amnesty to 5 million illegal immigrants to start off with. Has this ship sailed or could a President Cruz do something about this?  A: The president's executive amnesty - it is wrong. It is unfair to millions of legal immigrants who followed the rules. And it's patently unconstitutional. ... And indeed, someone who styles himself a constitutional scholar 22 times publicly made the point that it exceeds the president's authority to do that, and that person of course is Barack Obama, who 22 times previously said he had no authority to grant amnesty. In fact, in one of the times he explained, 'I am not an emperor.' Well, apparently after this last election after Democrats got walloped he discovered he was an emperor, and so he illegally and unconstitutionally granted amnesty to 4.5 million people. I along with millions of people across this country was heartbroken when Republican leadership just a couple of weeks ago capitulated entirely on amnesty. ... But there is a silver lining ... another branch of the government is doing its job, and that is Article 3, the federal judiciary. A federal court in the state of Texas has issued an injunction preventing President Obama's executive amnesty from going into effect. Q: I understand you've also been looking to see if the Obama administration has been breaking that court order? A: That is exactly right ... we will hold additional hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee to ascertain the degree to which the Obama administration is complying with that order. They need to obey the injunction from the federal court. They say that they are, but at the same time the federal court is having hearings on whether they have gone ahead and processed a number of amnesty applications in direct defiance of what they told the federal court what they would do.

16,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,"Chief justice, Suffolk DA joust over mandatory minimums",,BOB McGOVERN,The chief justice of the state's highest court and Boston's top prosecutor are butting heads over whether there should be mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders - a legal battle that turns on who wields the power to hand out punishment.,"'As long as prosecutors, rather than judges, hold the cards that determine sentences, we will not have individualized, evidence-based sentences,' SJC Chief Justice Ralph Gants said yesterday at a criminal justice conference at the University of Massachusetts Boston.  Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley struck back, saying mandatory minimum sentences have proven effective in stopping crime. He said giving judges discretion in sentencing on certain drug crimes was a 'failed policy' that has been off the books for decades. Crimes with mandatory minimums include trafficking, dealing and using or selling drugs in a school zone. 'There was complete, total and unfettered discretion prior to the institution and mandatory sentencing,' Conley told the Herald after the forum. 'Prosecutors who are making decisions on what sentences to bring and what charges to bring has driven down crime to unprecedented levels. It's part of prosecutors' toolbox, and I don't know how anyone can argue with it.' Gants said judges are better suited to craft sentences for each defendant. He added that mandatory minimum sentences have a 'disparate impact' on minorities. Conley said he doesn't impose mandatory minimum sentences in each case.  He said district attorneys are 'in a better position than a member of the judiciary to make the call on the amount of time those individuals ought to be incarcerated.'",['ENGLISH'],273,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

The question is: Will any work get done?","Employees across the nation are sure to take time out of their workdays this week to research matchups, make selections and complete their brackets. If you're a manager, brace for the chaos. The cost of lost wages paid to preoccupied and unproductive workers could reach $1.9 billion, according to outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas Inc. Sports has long been renowned for its inherent ability to bring people together. Capitalize on it.  Companies have an opportunity to use the legendary NCAA college basketball tournament as a team-building experience.   The tourney can be used to help bolster morale and encourage interactions among co-workers and clients who may not normally cross paths. Astute managers will respond to the call.  The reality is, anyone with an iPhone or tablet can access March Madness updates on company time. As long as people are clearly going to engage, a manager can acknowledge the tradition and set some rules.   Managers should have a plan. Establish rules early, roll them out and be bold. Mandate any NCAA activity be done on an employee's own time - during lunch, on their break or after work. Or, try to be more creative. Designate 'bracket breaks' to help build camaraderie, using this to your firm's advantage. Build 15-minute 'bracket updates' into the day. Create a company-wide office pool (free to enter) and offer a free lunch or gift card for the winner and post results on office pools. Note: If money is on the table, this could get dicey and out-of-hand.  Employees should honor management's initiative in opening this up, respect rules and boundaries established and use this as an opportunity to schmooze clients! Above all, especially after the long, hard, record-breaking winter, enjoy the activity, the camaraderie and the winnings. Have fun with March Madness ... especially if you have a sales force!

18,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Hockey-Bruins,Krejci's return a tough fit,,STEPHEN HARRIS,"WASHINGTON - It seems a little odd to say it, but when center David Krejci returns to the Bruins lineup in the next week or so, coach Claude Julien will have to make a difficult decision. It's possible that Krejci, who has been sidelined with a partially torn MCL in his left knee since Feb. 20, will be ready to rejoin the team soon for practice. Today marks four weeks since he was hurt, and the initial prognosis was 4-6 weeks. After seeing their season-saving, eight-game points streak (7-0-1) end with Sunday's 2-0 loss in Washington, the B's got a day off and will skate today ahead of tonight's home game against the Buffalo Sabres. They visit Ottawa on Thursday, and Krejci could return during back-to-back games in Florida this weekend against the Panthers (Saturday) and Lightning (Sunday).","But on what line? Given the play of his replacement, Ryan Spooner (three goals, five assists in his past nine games), it's hard to imagine Julien automatically plugging Krejci back onto the line with wingers Milan Lucic and David Pastrnak. That would shake up a threesome whose speed and offensive prowess have spurred the team's recent surge. When the B's have needed a goal, the Spooner line has been on the ice. And what would Julien do with Spooner, give him a seat in the pressbox? Play him as the fourth-line center and on the power play? Give him the third-line center spot in place of Carl Soderberg, who hasn't scored a goal since Jan. 17? Or Julien could leave Spooner where he is. Maybe Krejci is the one who needs to relocate, at least temporarily, to a wing spot. There's more to the Krejci/Spooner decision than just the talent of the two players. Julien also must take into consideration the fact Lucic has been more effective in recent weeks playing with the two youngsters. Both Spooner and Pastrnak play at high speed, forcing Lucic to pick up his tempo and energy. 'Right now, this young line he's with is a real good skating line,' Julien said. 'We've always said when (Lucic) skates, that's when he's at his best. Those guys have probably forced him to skate even more. '(Krejci) is a guy who will slow down the pace of the game and make good plays. When he's got good wingers with him, he will feed them on the fly. Right now, with (Lucic), it's about keeping up with those young, quick legs on his line. It's helped his game a lot.' Lucic is quick to defend Krejci as a great linemate but acknowledges the speed and enthusiasm of his young linemates have helped him. 'A lot of people don't view my game as a skating game,' Lucic said. 'But when I'm skating, that's when I'm most effective, when I'm moving my feet and (playing) that straight-line kind of hockey you can only play if your legs are going.' Pushing the pace has made Lucic a more effective forechecker and playmaker. Defenders give him much more room when he's bearing down on them at high speed, and in his past eight games, he has seven points (three goals) with a plus-2 rating. 'It seems to be the reason why I've had success as of late, playing with these guys,' he said. 'On the other hand, (Krejci) does like to slow the game down. I figured out playing with him how to get my feet going in the past. Unfortunately, it hasn't worked out that great for both of us this year. 'But I think if you're looking at right now, it is a good thing playing that type of style, that quick, skating game. It's definitely gotten me more involved than I had been earlier in the season. 'I'd still love to have had a healthy Krejci all year,' Lucic added. 'Who knows where I'd be at if he was healthy all year. I definitely miss him, but (Spooner) has definitely done a good job fitting in since he's been up here.' Spooner doesn't want to talk about Krejci's return. 'I'm trying not to think about it,' he said. 'I'm just trying to play well. I think they've always had the mindset here that if a player plays well, then they'll make a spot for you. I'm just trying to help the team.'",['ENGLISH'],657,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

21,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Basketball-Celtics,Right where C's belong,Win streak hits five as foes take notice,MARK MURPHY,"The Celtics' reputation continued to shine last night as one of the most improbable makeovers of the NBA season keeps looking prettier. They finished the proceedings in a three-way tie with Indiana and Miami for seventh playoff seed in the Eastern Conference, though the Pacers and Heat currently have tiebreaker edges thanks to better conference records. More importantly right now, though, the Celtics actually look like they belong there.","'I think they've improved a lot defensively since the last time we played them,' Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said after the Celtics swept the season series with a 108-89 win - their fifth straight, and their longest win streak of the Brad Stevens era. They have also won seven of their last eight and eight of their last 11. 'They've always had that firepower, the ability to score, but you can see a team that's right there to slide into the playoffs. We give them credit,' said Brown. Individual reputations are thriving, too. Tyler Zeller, who has quite possibly enjoyed the best two weeks of his NBA career, was given open space all night by the Sixers' reluctant big men, and he made them pay with a career-high 26-point, 11-for-15 performance. With Jared Sullinger out for the season, the seven-footer has popped out to mid-range to hit a steady diet of jumpers. Over the last two games Zeller has shot 19-for-25 as Indiana's Roy Hibbert and Philadelphia's Nerlens Noel have opted to give him open shots. '(The coaches) yelled at me a couple of times when nobody was within 5 feet of me and I didn't shoot it,' Zeller said of his progression this season. 'But with (Rajon) Rondo, if you can take a layup I'm going to take a layup over a jump shot. He does a great job of finding it. Now they've started packing it in recently, so now I'm trying to shoot it.' Zeller's contribution was only part of the Celtics' wave last night. They opened with a 38-point first quarter and never led by fewer than 16 points the rest of the way. The Celtics finished the game shooting an even 50 percent, including 40 percent (8-for-20) from 3-point range, and placed seven players in double figures, including all five starters. Avery Bradley broke out of a short slump with 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists, and Jae Crowder and Gigi Datome scored 10 each off the bench. 'It's nice when you have a game where you're making every shot, but that's one of those nights, and one of those nights is called that for a reason,' he said recently. 'You're not going to have it very often.' The event is also rewarding when it erupts like this. 'I think it's the continuity of the guys that have been here the whole time; they've really helped and really helped the way in a lot of ways,' Stevens said of his players, like Bradley, Brandon Bass and Zeller, who have survived the hailstorm of trades that rocked his roster this season. 'And then I just think our additions have been good; good, solid team guys that will compete, that are there helping each other and supporting one another,' said the Celtics coach. Players like Bradley can now claim they even saw this recent success coming. 'I saw that we were improving every single game and I knew we would have a chance if we set our mind to it and started speaking to it, and that's what we were doing,' said Bradley. 'We never thought we didn't have a chance to make the playoffs. Now we're right there.' And here's a bonus: The rest of the league is starting to notice.",['ENGLISH'],572,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

23,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Basketball-Celtics,Good to see Philly again,76ers provide little opposition,CELTICS BEAT by STEVE BULPETT,"A Monday night game in mid-March against the 76ers is grounds for no big whoop. Except when you're the Celtics and you've been granted, through good deeds of your own and grace of the Eastern Conference, admission to the playoff race . . . and you look at your itinerary and see a flight to Oklahoma City today and one from there to San Antonio later in the week. Then a date with the Philadelphians becomes a desperate, must-have, don't-leave-home-without-it outing. Lose this one, and even if Russell Westbrook gets a head cold tomorrow and Gregg Popovich decides to rest his first seven on Friday, you're still looking at a rough week.","So it was comforting for the 'we don't need no stinking lottery pick' crowd that the Celtics went ahead by 22 in the first quarter and kept pushing all the way to a 108-89 victory. Maybe it was because Philly didn't push back all that much, but the C's avoided their fate from eight nights prior when they took a 20-point lead a minute into the second quarter in Orlando - and lost. Losing on your home floor to the team with the third-worst record in the NBA would have come packaged with a side order of insult. Then again, as Evan Turner put it after 10 points and five assists against his old team, 'Every loss really sucks. 'When we gave the game away in Orlando, that really sucked. When we gave the game away versus the Golden State Warriors, that really sucked. When we gave a game away versus the Kings, that sucked. If we would have taken care of those, we probably wouldn't have to worry too much. Now we need every win we possibly can get.' This victory means the Celts are assured of being in touch with Indiana, Miami and Charlotte in what is currently a four-team musical chairs competition for the last two playoff seats in the East. 'I just think all the games are ones we really need,' Turner said. 'We're in like a four-way tie every other day, so we can't really pick and choose. We need every single game we can possibly get.' Dining on the 76ers before meeting the Thunder and Spurs was akin to what many a wise person was doing on St. Patrick's Eve. Getting a little nourishment before hitting the hard stuff. 'Yeah, for sure,' Jae Crowder said. 'We are aware that we needed this win tonight. Now we just have to see how it plays out on the road.' After last night was in the books, coach Brad Stevens turned the page quickly. 'We're going on a tough road trip,' Stevens said. 'That's really all I'm thinking about right now.' Looking at the importance of this one in the postseason-drive scheme of things, Stevens said, 'I don't know. I haven't heard them talk about it once. I'm dead serious. I mean, we've talked about it. We've seen the standings, but I don't hear it. I have not heard them say whoever Miami's playing today, or who's Charlotte playing today? They haven't talked about it around me. Maybe they are; I don't know. 'But I just want to play good basketball. I think our guys just want to play good basketball, and I think as a result you have a lot more fun when you spray the ball around the way we're spraying it around and when you're competing together and pulling for one another and five guys playing together on a string defensively. And we're still not as good as we need to be, but I think our team that's out there right now without Isaiah (Thomas) can play better. And you know, we're going to need to play better in the next two games to have a chance to win.' The now 15-52 Sixers gave the Celtics very little chance to lose. No, the visitors are not exactly the pushovers they were last season, and, yes, they have quality wins over Cleveland and Atlanta, but the former came when the Cavaliers were without LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. The Philly fate was sealed before tipoff on opening night. There is no Selection Sunday for it to sweat. The NIT is not on line 2. In the third quarter, Avery Bradley cleanly removed the ball from Luc Mbah a Moute's hands as he drove. Bradley was, however, called for a shooting foul. Under normal circumstances, Bradley and the Garden crowd would be incensed. But, ahead by 20 points, no one had the heart to complain. It would have been unsportsmanlike to whine. The Celtics went ahead and completed the four-game season sweep of the Sixers, each win by double figures for an average margin of 14.75. Now the opponents become rather more frightening. 'How scary?' Crowder said. 'No, it's exciting. It's good basketball. We're playing the top teams. It's fun.' Crowder may be whistling past the dentist's office a bit on that one, for this will be a root canal of a road trip. Good thing the Celts flossed with Philly before they left.",['ENGLISH'],774,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

25,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Baseball-Red Sox,Serve them Wright,"If Kelly's out, team can lean on veteran knuckler",JASON MASTRODONATO / red sox notebook,"FORT MYERS - One starting pitcher down, the Red Sox could turn to a knuckleballer to round out their staff. It all depends how Joe Kelly feels in the coming weeks. Kelly couldn't put any spin on the ball yesterday, when he felt biceps tightness in his right throwing arm during warmups and tried to pitch through it during a Grapefruit League game against the New York Mets. Kelly tried throwing mostly fastballs and changeups, but even that hurt. The final pitch came in the third inning, when Kelly already had allowed three runs on seven hits and the pain became too obvious for the Red Sox to ignore. Sox manager John Farrell and the training staff ran out to look at Kelly and immediately took him out of the game.","'Yeah, they saw me kind of shaking my arm a little more than usual and asked me what's wrong,' Kelly said. 'I said, 'My biceps (are) little tight and a little achy.' It progressively got a little bit worse.' Kelly said he's dealt with a similar issue in the past and gotten over it quickly. 'Usually it gets knocked out pretty quick,' he said. 'Just a little bit of work in the training room and not really a whole lot of rest. Just kind of got to get through it yourself and eventually it goes away.' As hopeful as the Red Sox are that Kelly won't have to miss time, this spring has been anything but fluid for the 26-year-old. He was throwing fastballs in the high-80s during his first start, and when he was asked if he had reached the high-90s in his second outing, Kelly candidly answered, 'That's probably false. My arm doesn't feel that good.' The Red Sox' sixth starter, should Kelly have to miss time, would likely be 30-year-old knuckleballer Steven Wright. Behind Wright, the Sox aren't exactly flush with starting pitching depth - their next-best option could be Matt Barnes, whose only major league experience came out of the bullpen, and a few highly regarded prospects who the Red Sox prefer not to rush to the majors. Wright was impressive in posting a 2.57 ERA over 21 innings with the Red Sox last year and has developed into a two-speed knuckleball pitcher who can consistently throw them for strikes. He walked just 22 batters in 95 innings with Triple-A Pawtucket last year. 'I feel like I'm ready for whatever job they want me to do, whether it's in Boston or Pawtucket,' Wright said. 'Hopefully it's in Boston at some point, but I feel confident to where if I just keep doing what I'm doing, working with (pitching coach Juan Nieves and former knuckler Tim Wakefield), I'm ready whenever they call upon me to go out there and compete.' Rusney's return on tap Rusney Castillo should be in the Red Sox lineup tomorrow. Castillo, who has been out since March 4 with a left oblique strain, has experienced no restrictions in his recovery. 'He's passed every baseball physical test that's we've put him in front of to date,' Farrell said. Still, it'll be an uphill climb for the 27-year-old to out-duel Mookie Betts for the starting center field job. After going 2-for-3, including a double high off the left-field wall against Matt Harvey, Betts is 10-for-23 this spring. Spring in his step He's usually seen carrying equipment bags and frequently shuttles between whichever minor league team needs a catcher most, but yesterday, Matt Spring had a moment to remember. The 30-year-old career minor leaguer hit a home run off Mets prospect Noah Syndergaard. Spring, who has spent 11 years in the minors (the last four in the Red Sox organization) has never appeared in a major league game and played in just eight spring training games. 'The most important thing is my son (Bo) was watching at home,' Spring said. 'He's 2. I ranked over Mickey Mouse, so that's great.'",['ENGLISH'],614,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

26,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Cops: 'Stare down' sparked gunfight that killed woman,,ANTONIO PLANAS,"A tension-filled 'stare down' between rivals last summer led to the gunfire that killed a 26-year-old Brighton woman who was an innocent bystander a block away, on her way to the city's Caribbean festival, police and prosecutors said.","Wesson Colas, 22, pleaded not guilty yesterday in Suffolk Superior Court to first-degree murder and assault charges for allegedly pointing a gun at a group shortly after a confrontation inside a Blue Hill Avenue store on Aug. 23. Once outside, Colas was shot at, and one round fatally struck Dawnn Jaffier in the head, authorities said. Although Colas did not fire the shot that killed Jaffier, 26, he is facing first-degree murder for inciting the gunplay because he was first to raise a weapon, said Assistant District Attorney Mark Lee. 'That precipitated gunfire,' Lee said yesterday, noting Jaffier was struck by a stray bullet about a block away. Authorities said a 20-year-old woman three blocks away was struck in the leg by another errant bullet. Keith Williams, 18, the suspected triggerman, also faces a first-degree murder charge. The Suffolk DA's office said Colas was indicted on a theory of murder under a 1997 Supreme Judicial Court ruling  that, 'Where the defendant chooses to engage in a gun battle with another with the intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm and a third party is killed, the defendant may be held liable for the homicide even if it was the defendant's opponent who fired the fatal shot.'

27,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Dzhokhar could've sailed into paradise,,PETER GELZINIS,About the only defense Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers have offered so far is to let the jury know how he envied his big brother Tamerlan's entrance into paradise as a martyr.,"'I'm jealous of my brother who has received the reward of jannutul Firdaus (inshallah) before me,' Dzhokhar scribbled in pencil on the inside wall of David Henneberry's runabout 'Slip Away II,' perched on a trailer behind his Watertown home on that fateful April night two years ago. Slip Away II immediately ceased to be a boat and became a 24-foot piece of evidence in the marathon bombing trial ... one that jurors got to see close-up yesterday. But what they actually saw in a nondescript Southie warehouse was Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's ticket to paradise - the one he chose not to use. Let's face it, if the younger jihadist really wanted to join his older brother in the afterlife, all he had to do when an army of state and local police unleashed hellfire on Slip Away II was stand up, or at the very least lift his head, and he certainly would have been a lot closer to the gates of paradise. Instead, Dzhokhar chose, as the prosecution noted, to wrap his arms around the engine compartment and hang on for dear life. Somehow, Dzhokhar managed to survive a blizzard of bullets to stand up and fall out of the boat, bloodied by non-life-threatening injuries that were only going to get him as far as a federal prison hospital ... not paradise. Yesterday, as jurors were hoisted on a forklift to get a closer view of the bullet holes, the streaks of Dzhokhar's blood and the so-called manifesto he scrawled, sources say the defendant sat under a canopy a short distance away, tugging on his chin hair. Ironically, the story of yesterday's testimony only seemed to reinforce the idea that it was Tamerlan, not his kid brother, who was ready and willing to enter paradise. He was the guy who ran straight toward Watertown Police Sgt. Jeffrey Pugliese firing until he ran out of bullets. And if his kid brother hadn't run him over with that carjacked Mercedes, who knows, maybe Tamerlan would have been denied the reward of jannutul Firdaus (inshallah) and those 72 virgins. Perhaps, after he had crawled into Slip Away II, maybe Dzhokhar thought he would go to sleep and ease into martyrdom. But when the opportunity presented itself for Dzhokhar to go out in blaze of infamy, he chose to hide deep down in the belly of the boat. He clearly wanted to stick around. One final note: Friends say that David Henneberry never went fishing on Slip Away II. He couldn't stand to have fish blood and guts stain the inside of his boat.",['ENGLISH'],430,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

28,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Baseball-Red Sox,Two 'aces' in holes already,"Masterson, Kelly shaky so far",RON BORGES,"FORT MYERS - The past two days have not been good ones for the Five Aces. In fact, after Justin Masterson and Joe Kelly were finished the past two afternoons - which didn't take long by the way, in either case - the skeptical might suggest the Red Sox rotation looked like three aces and two jokers. Much has been made of the Sox' insistence on entering the season without a definable 'ace,' the classic alpha dog starting pitcher the rest of the staff looks up to and can rely on to slam the brakes on potential losing streaks and carry the day in the clutch. Early in spring training, manager John Farrell went so far as to postulate that he had five No. 1 starters, while pitching coach Juan Nieves argued that at any particular stretch during a long season someone can emerge for a few weeks to serve as an ace of the moment before returning to his true self. At that point, one would guess, the hope is someone else makes a short-term appearance at that position until a real ace shows up.","It's a good theory, but as far as a plan, one has to wonder about it. Sounds like something Pete Carroll might conjure up with the ball on the goal line and seconds left in the Super Bowl. But I digress. To add insult to injury, literally, Masterson was lit up Sunday by the Phillies, allowing seven hits, including two homers, and six earned runs. Kelly came back yesterday and gave up the identical number of hits, including two doubles in the second inning, and three earned runs in 22/3 innings before having to leave with a trainer by his side because of a balky biceps. We all understand that baseball is a marathon not a sprint. It is a long process of preparation and performance before anything is really decided definitively, so one should never put too much stock in either a strong outing or back-to-back circumstances where two of the Five Aces come up short. Yet these last two days give one pause to wonder anew whether the Sox have Five Aces or, like the hamburger joint, five guys. Yesterday one of them, Kelly, struggled with a biceps that began to tighten like a vice, quickly preventing him from throwing anything but fastballs. That might have worked at times for Nolan Ryan or Pedro Martinez, but in general not much good happens at the major league level when all you can throw is the same pitch over and over again. 'Warming up earlier my arm had a little bit of biceps tightness,' Kelly said. 'As the game progressed, it got more than tight. Basically I could only throw my fastball. I didn't think it was a big deal but it began to affect how the ball came out of my hand. I couldn't spin the ball. I thought it would work itself out. It didn't. I was getting hit around.' Indeed he was. Meaningless as it is when one has thrown so few innings, there's no questioning the fact Kelly's ERA at the moment is 11.05 and Masterson's is a less than masterful 6.48. At this stage of the spring, those are just numbers. But if you have lingering doubts that this insistence on saying they have Five Aces when in fact they have none may come back to haunt them, the last 48 hours did nothing to ease your concerns. Farrell, of course, has no concerns, which is the beauty of the man. If he was a golf pro who just shot 81, he'd say he struck the ball well but just didn't score. That's his role and his personality. It's a gift. His cup is always half-full and trending toward overflowing. So when asked if he had any worries either about Kelly's health or the Five Aces' future after a 4-3 win over the Mets yesterday, Farrell made clear none of this has led him to take Ambien to get to sleep at night. 'There's a process to go through (to prepare starting pitchers for the season),' Farrell cautioned. 'You can't skip any steps. Getting up and down, building their pitch count. Guys aren't always going to feel 100 percent on given days. You fully expect pitchers will go through ebbs and flows of arm strength in spring training. Some of our starters are going through a dead-arm period.' Fair enough, but are the Sox dead without an ace is the larger question? Hard to know, but if you were sitting in JetBlue Park on a sunny Monday afternoon watching a real ace, the Mets' Matt Harvey, mow down the Sox' lineup, you certainly understood the difference between Five Guys and one ace. Harvey, who is coming back from Tommy John surgery, scattered three hits over four innings, striking out three and allowing no runs. He was overpowering much of the time, reminding a crowd of 10,024 mostly Sox supporters that there is something still missing here in Fort Myers this spring, and it's not snow.",['ENGLISH'],766,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

31,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,Hub students make strong argument for debate teams,,JESSICA HESLAM,Charlestown High School junior and aspiring lawyer Mohammad Umar was so nervous at the start of his first debate tournament last year that his left leg was shaking. But Umar's nerves were put at ease after he won the first round debating Cuba's embargo. He gave coach James Soares a high-five and said: 'Sign me up for the next tournament. I love it.',"Umar, 17, now a team captain, said debating has improved his writing, reading and public speaking skills.  'I feel like I am much, much more confident,' Umar said. Success stories like his are behind a massive plan to start debate teams at every public middle and high school in Boston. A Georgia State University study on Boston's debate program found that students who joined debate teams have higher grades, higher test scores and are more likely to take and pass AP tests than those not on debate teams, said Steve Stein, executive director of the Boston Debate League, a nonprofit that works with BPS to start debate teams, run tournaments and train teachers as debate coaches. The Debate League began about nine years ago with three Hub schools and is now in 28 middle and high schools. Over the next five to seven years, Stein said, the goal is to have a debate team in each of the city's 75 middle and high schools. The $2 million annual budget - heavily supported by corporate donations and foundations - is expected to triple.  'We'd love to see a day where thousands of students are graduating from BPS every year trained in debate,' said Stein, who said the program has helped students struggling the most, 'especially male students of color.' Over the past seven years, Stein said they've been 'intentionally recruiting' students who struggle with academics, those with behavioral problems and those who are learning English. They found that the students 'loved debate,' Stein said. Last year, a pilot program in Spanish was launched. The students debate serious public policy topics - this year it's ocean exploration and development. They practice after school and compete in six tournaments a year. At Charlestown High yesterday, Umar and Joshua Rosa, his debate partner and fellow captain, were gearing up for this week's Citi Foundation Championships. Joshua, a 17-year-old junior, said he was hooked after winning his first round in a debate tournament. His public speaking skills have improved and he wants to study pre-law or pre-med at NYU. 'In class, I'm more engaged and more involved in the discussions,' he said. Said coach Soares: 'It's such an amazing way to empower students.'",['ENGLISH'],424,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

The future of their country - and peace in the Middle East - depends on it.","If Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu loses his re-election bid today, the winner is Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah and radical jihadists worldwide who hate Israel, the United States and every freedom Western civilization stands for. Yet despite Netanyahu's unwavering friendship and wise counsel to the United States, President Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will be cheering his defeat, as well as dozens of other misguided Democrats who boycotted Netanyahu's recent historic speech before Congress about Iran's nuclear threat. It's an utter travesty we had to receive that warning, and a much-needed explanation of the cataclysmic consequences that failed nuke talks would undoubtedly yield, from a foreign leader instead of from our own president. It's obvious Obama and Kerry are more interested in coming to an agreement with Iran that's a public relations 'win' for them first versus crafting a pact that actually keeps Israel and future generations safe from harm. Americans don't want our president to kick the nuclear can down the road.  Netanyahu explained in his speech that Iran already has nuclear capability that can reach America's shores. And we know there's no safe haven from our other enemies - such as ISIS - accessing and utilizing dirty bombs or warheads in the future. A new report says the Kurds are accusing ISIS fighters of using chemical weapons in their ongoing Holy War against humanity. Will the Islamic State turn down an opportunity to amplify its power and influence tenfold by getting a nuke in the future?  You can bet your last dollar the answer is no.  What we know for sure is that once Iran completes its nuclear program, it will trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, making America and the world a much less safe place.  All the more reason Israelis need to re-elect one of the finest leaders of the free world, Benjamin Netanyahu. He's an honest and fearless leader who shares our interests and has America's back.

34,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Basketball-Celtics,Datome fan club building up,,MARK MURPHY / celtics notebook,"A new Garden folk hero appears to have been born. Luigi Datome, a native of Sardinia who was perhaps the finest Italian player in Serie A before he went to Detroit to languish on the bench, reemerged as one of Brad Stevens' best shooters off the bench.  And, as the Garden crowd demonstrated yet again during the swingman's 10-point performance last night, there's no shortage of appreciation.","'I'm very surprised, but I think people are excited because it's somebody new,' Datome said after the Celtics' 108-89 win over Philadelphia. 'Brand new in this league, but, of course, the love from the fans is moving me on.' This is also the happiest Datome admittedly felt on an NBA roster. 'Last summer with the national team,' Datome replied when asked the last time he was this happy.  'I was thinking about it. I never had so many games in a row with real minutes, when the game counted. My goal when I came into the league was to show I belonged on this level, and coach Stevens gave me this opportunity. It's just fantastic.' Thomas a no-go As Stevens repeatedly said last night, nobody wants to get back on the basketball court more than Isaiah Thomas. If only the Celtics guard's bruised lower back agreed. Thomas got the bad news during a meeting with Celtics trainer Ed Lacerte yesterday morning. The pain in his back was still too intense to allow him to play last night, thus extending his absence to four straight games. And the time frame is worse.  The Celtics leave tomorrow for games in Oklahoma City and San Antonio, and Thomas will spend that time getting treatment here. 'He'll be reevaluated tomorrow, but right now I'd say it's unlikely he travels,' Stevens said before last night's game. 'He's still three games away, which is too bad. He really wants to play. To say he's antsy is an understatement.' No further tests have been deemed necessary for Thomas. 'Ed said it's as tough of a bruise as he's ever seen,' Stevens said. 'Nobody wants to play more than that kid. That's what I appreciate about him. He had himself convinced he would play the next day after he fell. Hopefully he gets better sooner rather than later. He's a tough kid. Nobody questions that. He's doing nothing running-wise, movement-wise. He started jogging on the treadmill. But he hasn't been able to push himself as much as he needed to.' College calling A source said that, if contacted, Celtics assistant Jay Larranaga will consider interviewing for the opening at George Mason, the program his dad Jim took to the 2006 Final Four. Larranaga is said to view it all with due diligence, as opposed to genuine interest, out of respect for his father's former program. 'He loves working for Brad (Stevens) and the Celtics,' said the source, indicating that it would take a very special situation - another NBA job - for Larranaga to leave the Celtics. A league source said that Larranaga, who interviewed for the 76ers job last season, can expect to be getting more calls from NBA teams. 'The reality is that I'd be surprised if Jay wants that job,' the source said. 'He's going to have chances at head NBA jobs. If he went to George Mason, that would hurt his chances.' Stevens said he certainly understands the interest. 'It would be smart to pursue him, but I don't know what his interests are,' he said. 'He's just a really good basketball guy. He's smart, he works really hard, he's positive. I've talked about our staff and how great they've been all year. Any of those guys would be good for opportunities like that. One thing I'm excited about is that I have a chance to work with those guys every day, because I learn more from them than they do from me.'",['ENGLISH'],605,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

35,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,BAKER DEFENDS JOKES,"'If you can't poke fun at yourself, you're not getting it'",O'RYAN JOHNSON and BOB MCGOVERN,"Gov. Charlie Baker is standing by his MBTA skit at South Boston's St. Patrick's Day Breakfast - and doubled down last night at another holiday dinner in Lowell, where he mocked the transit agency's dysfunctional commuter rail line.","'It was an opportunity for all of us to sort of poke fun at ourselves, and let's face it, we all know it's been a long winter. The MBTA had some issues we worked pretty hard with them to fix,' Baker told the Herald last night. 'If you can't poke fun at yourself, you're not getting it.'  Baker drew some chuckles at the St. Patrick's Day fete in Lowell, when he joked that during the height of the storms he would be told a number of commuter rail engines were ready to go the next day - only to see that number shrink the following morning.  'I was like, what are these things, teenagers? 'I got up this morning, Dad looked at me kind of funny. I was out drinking last night. I'm sorry.' ... I wish I was kidding, but the simple truth is the main reason we had so much trouble with the commuter rail is because inside those big, brawny locomotives beats the heart of a 16-year-old,' Baker said.  'We've been doing everything we can to get them to grow up fast. We're told we have 50 of them ready to go tomorrow morning,' he said. 'As long as nobody has any exams - or nobody wants to celebrate St. Patrick's Day with their friends - we should be fine in the morning.'  Baker got mixed reviews Sunday when he appeared in a video with event emcee, state Sen. Linda Dorcena Forry, waiting for a late bus to take them to the breakfast. Departing T general manager Beverly Scott then pulls up behind the wheel and hopes out loud that there's 'absolutely no reason to put you in the back of the bus,' before telling the governor to 'buckle up.' Newly minted Attorney General Maura Healey also drew some heat for holding up several fake subpoenas at the Sunday breakfast, and jokingly telling lawmakers in the crowd, 'Some of you might be familiar with these. So laugh.' Santa Clara University Law School professor Margalynne Armstrong found the joke inappropriate for the state's top lawwoman. 'She needs to make sure she gives the office the respect it deserves. It's important to not treat her power lightly,' Armstrong said. 'The decent thing to do would be to apologize. And it should be a real apology.'  Healey noted she didn't catch any flak for the joke. 'No, not for that. For a bad performance, maybe. Not that part of the performance, no,' she told the Herald. 'Was I supposed to? It was a joke. It's a roast.' She also said the subpoenas were obvious props.  'They didn't have the right seal,' she said. 'Did you see them? They were like Crayola subpoenas.'",['ENGLISH'],447,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

36,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Baseball-Red Sox,Pedro: Ace motivator,Sox legend stresses 'attitude' with staff,RED SOX BEAT by SCOTT LAUBER,"FORT MYERS - Gather 'round, wannabe Red Sox aces (we're talking to you, Clay Buchholz; look alive, Rick Porcello): Uncle Pedro has a story to tell. 'I got into Montreal (in 1994) and I had just come from being a reliever with the Dodgers,' Pedro Martinez was saying the other day. '(Manager) Felipe (Alou) called me into the office one day in spring training and he handed me a ball and said, 'Pedro, you're my No. 4 starter.' I'm like, 'Oh, really? Thank you so much for the opportunity.' And he goes, 'Don't worry about being No. 4, because after the first three guys pitch, you're the No. 1. You have to feel like a No. 1 every time you take the mound.' ' Now, surely Martinez knows that being a No. 1 starter is more than a state of mind. He didn't become the greatest pitcher of his generation, to say nothing of a first-ballot Hall of Famer, by virtue of having extreme self-confidence. The blazing fastball, knees-knocking curve, bat-slowing changeup (that might only be the nastiest pitch ever thrown) and the fearlessness to brush back any hitter undoubtedly had more to do with it.","And after a week-long visit to fulfill his duties as a special instructor and assistant to general manager Ben Cherington, Martinez also must know the Red Sox lack a pitcher with real No. 1-starter bona fides. Jon Lester isn't walking through the clubhouse door. Neither is Philadelphia Phillies ace Cole Hamels, for whom the Sox made a trade offer that one MLB source recently labeled as 'poor.' It's difficult to imagine they won't eventually obtain such an alpha pitcher, especially with principal owner John Henry green-lighting a record payroll that will approach $200 million for luxury tax purposes. But in the meantime, it behooves everyone in the organization to help instill enough confidence in Buchholz, Porcello and the other starters that they believe any of them are capable of taking the lead. And that's the tune Martinez is singing. 'A guy like Hamels, like Lester, top-notch starters, they're welcome in any team,' Martinez said. 'But if they're not here, I would be saying, 'Hey, I'm capable. Hamels was once what I am today, so why not me?' That would be the question I would have. I think they have to walk around with that same attitude - why not me, or why not us? Why can't we all be aces?' So, Martinez loves the customized 'He's the ACE' T-shirts that Buchholz ordered and distributed to Porcello, Justin Masterson, Joe Kelly and lefty Wade Miley to wear around the clubhouse before games. It shows 'character,' he says, and demonstrates the attitude he believes the starters need to have. Of course, proven aces don't need T-shirts. When Mets right-hander Matt Harvey scaled the mound yesterday at JetBlue Park, everyone knew they were about to see one of the majors' best. The same went for Martinez in his 201 starts for the Sox from 1998-2004. 'Any one of these guys could be the stopper,' Martinez said. 'They were just never put in this spot. And this (Red Sox) team is no joke. This team is going to put up some runs. This team is going to produce for them.' Ironically, people were saying the same thing about the Red Sox 10 years ago, after Martinez left to sign with the Mets. With Curt Schilling injured, the 2005 Sox went through most of the season with an ace-less rotation that consisted of David Wells, Matt Clement, Tim Wakefield, Bronson Arroyo and Wade Miller, only one of whom (Wakefield) posted an ERA below the league average. That team won 95 games and made the playoffs on the back of an offense that scored 910 runs but got swept out of the playoffs by the Chicago White Sox' superior starters. Still, Martinez is bullish on the potential of this year's rotation. He's impressed by Kelly's talent, and noted that Masterson was the Cleveland Indians' best pitcher for much of the 2013 season. He believes Porcello is 'showing signs of someone that could become the ace of the team,' and described Buchholz as 'going about his work like he's got a purpose.' Maybe so. But is there an ace in the bunch? Here, again, we yield to Uncle Pedro. 'My advice to those guys: Feel like you're the ace every single time you take the mound,' Martinez said. 'They know what they need to do. I'm not concerned, to be honest.'",['ENGLISH'],706,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

William 'Mo' Cowan - a onetime board member of the state convention center authority - is an equity partner in an $800 million Seaport District hotel that's being proposed as part of the agency's controversial $1 billion expansion, the Herald has learned. Cowan, who also served as former Gov. Deval Patrick's chief of staff and chief legal counsel, and another former member of the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority's board, Dean Stratouly, both have ownership stakes in the Omni Hotel & Resorts-backed 'headquarters hotel' project. It is one of six bids to build a 1,000- to 1,200-room, $800 million hotel across from the convention center.","Cowan was tapped by Patrick in February 2013 to replace John F. Kerry in the U.S. Senate until Edward J. Markey won the seat in a special election five months later.  Cowan told the Herald in an email he did not see any conflict being an equity partner in the hotel after serving on the board that will decide on his bid. 'I do not discuss my personal investment decisions,' said Cowan, now a lawyer at Mintz Levin, when asked how much money he has invested for his equity stake.  Cowan, who served on the board from February 2008 to November 2010, also confirmed he is friends with Greg Shell, husband of the panel's current chairwoman, Michelle A. Shell. Stratouly - who served on the MCCA board from February 1998 to June 2010, and chaired its building committee - also downplayed perceptions that his project might be looked on more favorably due to his longtime ties with the MCCA. 'I am not quite sure how it would be a conflict of interest given the amount of time that has lapsed for either me or Mo' since serving on the board, Stratouly said. 'The fact that I have spent time working on the convention center is widely known. And this is a new board that I don't have any relationship with. That board came in as we exited ... so I think enough time has lapsed that there is no holdover knowledge.' James Rooney, the MCCA's executive director, declined an interview request yesterday. But during a break at his board's expansion committee meeting Friday he denied any favoritism would be given to his two former board members. 'There is a process. I'm sure it will be a rigorous process that is devoid of who the players are,' Rooney said. 'It's a very rational process involving capacity to build a hotel, the design, the level of participation, and that is how they will be judged. I don't see that they have an upper hand at all. They will be tested just like the rest.' Neither Cowan or Stratouly have filed any conflict of interest disclosures with the State Ethics Commission or the MCCA.  State 'revolving door' laws permanently ban state 'employees,' including those who volunteer on boards, from becoming financially involved in projects they worked on while serving the state.  If the person did not directly work on the project but it fell under their official purview, there is a one-year cooling off period. Both Cowan and Stratouly have passed that period. The headquarters hotel is a '50-50 undertaking' between the MCCA and Massport, which owns the two vacant parcels bordering Summer and D streets where the hotel will be built. The MCCA said the first official action taken on the project came on June 20, 2013 - after both Cowan and Stratouly left - when both the MCCA and Massport boards approved a letter of intent to begin developing the hotel site.",['ENGLISH'],572,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

39,"Newspaper, Newspapers",NEWS,Local,"In close race, Netanyahu vows no Palestinian state",,KIMBERLY ATKINS,"WASHINGTON - In last-minute campaigning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday said that if his party stays in power he will reject the creation of a Palestinian state, a pitch aimed at shoring up his support on the right in a hard-fought race. ","'Whoever moves to establish a Palestinian state or intends to withdraw from territory is simply yielding territory for radical Islamic attacks against Israel,' Netanyahu told the Israeli news site NRG. When asked if that meant no Palestinian state, he replied, 'Indeed.' Netanyahu used the backdrop of Har Homa, a Jewish settlement built on West Bank land annexed to Jerusalem, to warn that under his opponents, the center-left Zionist Union alliance headed by Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni would cede the area and allow it to be turned into 'Hamastan,' a reference to the Islamist militant group Hamas. Netanyahu's statements seemed aimed to halt the seepage of Likud votes to other conservative parties. Netanyahu's main rival on the right, the pro-settlement Jewish Home party, opposes a Palestinian state. While Netanyahu had been seen just a few months ago as likely to win, the election today in Israel is now more about bread-and-butter issues than the strained negotiations over Iran's nuclear ambitions, election-watchers told the Herald. 'The major political questions candidates have had to address are the price of cottage cheese and the cost of housing,' said David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee.  Netanyahu's controversial address to the U.S. Congress and ongoing tensions with President Obama drew headlines here, but those issues barely registered in Israel, where Netanyahu's Likud Party is facing a strong challenge from the Zionist Union. Voters don't elect the prime minister directly, but if Netanyahu's party doesn't secure enough of the 120 seats in the Knesset, he could lose the post to Herzog - but that is one of several potential outcomes that could take days to emerge from this tight race and complex parliamentary system. The prospect of restarting stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, a top priority of U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, also played a minimal role. Palestinians won't be watching the results, because they expect little to change, said Diana Buttu, an analyst and former spokeswoman of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Negotiations Support Unit.

40,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Basketball-College Men,Saunders respects roots of Crimson,,RICH THOMPSON,"Crimson guard Wesley Saunders claims to feel duty-bound by Harvard's traditions. His performance easily can be measured on a stat sheet, or by the many Ivy League accolades he's accumulated in his unprecedented run at the school. Saunders is a three-time All-Ivy League first-team All-Star and was last season's conference player of the year. But the 6-foot-5, 215-pound Los Angeles transplant needs to satisfy some unspecified obligations to coach Tommy Amaker and the Crimson players who've helped turn Harvard into a basketball dynasty.","'It's great for me, but at the same time I can't forget about how it came to be this way,' Saunders said. 'It all started with the players before us paving the way and coach Amaker really getting us to buy into his system.' Saunders will compete in his sixth NCAA tournament game when 13th-seeded Harvard (22-7) engages fourth-seeded North Carolina (24-11) in the second round of the West Regional on Thursday night at Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena in Florida. 'This has been great to see how everything has come together to get us to this point and time,' said Saunders. 'I have just been lucky enough to be here at the right time but honestly, it's about the players before and everybody before who laid the foundation of what we have achieved.'     Harvard has won 20 or more games in six straight seasons, captured a share of the Ivy League title in each of the past five years and will appear in its fourth straight NCAA tournament. The Crimson needed a dramatic 53-51 victory against archrival Yale in a one-game playoff on Saturday in Philadelphia to capture the Ivy League's automatic berth. The last Ivy League team to secure four straight trips to the Big Dance was Princeton (1989-92).  'We feel like we can compete with anybody and I think we've shown over the years we can be competitive with just about any team in the country,' Saunders said. 'We are looking forward to the opportunity to go out there again and just play and see what we are made of.' The Crimson have demonstrated they can respect the name on their opponents' jerseys without being intimidated. Harvard upset New Mexico in the second round in 2013 and laid a 61-57 beating on fourth-seeded Cincinnati last March. Harvard rallied from a 16-point deficit to put a scare into perennial Big Ten power Michigan State before bowing 80-73 to the Spartans. The confidence from last year's run can carry over against the Tar Heels. Harvard's projected starters are Saunders at off-guard, Siyani Chambers on the point with Agunwa Okolie on the wing and Steve Moundou-Missi and Zena Edosomwan underneath. 'I think a lot of time with us being in the Ivy League, we don't get the respect around the country that other teams and other leagues do,' Saunders said. 'So it's opportunities like this where we can measure ourselves against the bigger-name school and bigger-name conferences. We just want this great opportunity to compete, and we know Carolina is great team. They are big and fast, but they aren't bigger and faster than Michigan State.'

42,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Basketball-Celtics,No doubting Thomas wants to be in lineup,,MARK MURPHY / celtics notebook,"As Brad Stevens repeatedly said last night, nobody wants to get back on the basketball court more than Isaiah Thomas. If only the Celtics guard's bruised lower back agreed. Thomas received the bad news during a meeting with Celtics trainer Ed Lacerte yesterday morning. The pain in his back was still too intense to allow him to play last night against Philadelphia, thus extending his absence to four straight games. And the time frame is worse. The Celtics leave tomorrow for games in Oklahoma City and San Antonio, and Thomas will spend that time getting treatment here.","'He'll be reevaluated tomorrow, but right now I'd say it's unlikely he travels,' Stevens said before last night's 108-89 win against the 76ers. 'He's still three games away, which is too bad. He really wants to play. To say he's antsy is an understatement.' No further tests have been deemed necessary. 'Ed said it's as tough of a bruise as he's ever seen,' Stevens said. 'Nobody wants to play more than that kid. That's what I appreciate about him. He had himself convinced he would play the next day after he fell. Hopefully he gets better sooner rather than later. He's a tough kid. Nobody questions that. He's doing nothing running-wise, movement-wise. He started jogging on the treadmill. But he hasn't been able to push himself as much as he needed to.' College calling A source said that, if contacted, Celtics assistant Jay Larranaga will consider interviewing for the opening at George Mason, the program his dad Jim took to the 2006 Final Four. Larranaga is said to look on the matter with due diligence, as opposed to genuine interest, as well as respect for his father's former program. 'He loves working for Brad (Stevens) and the Celtics,' said the source, indicating that it would take a very special situation - another NBA job - for Larranaga to leave the Celtics.  A league source said that Larranaga, who interviewed for the 76ers job last season, can expect to be getting more calls from NBA teams. 'The reality is that I'd be surprised if Jay wants that job,' the source said. 'He's going to have chances at head NBA jobs. If he went to George Mason, that would hurt his chances.' Stevens said he certainly understands the interest. 'It would be smart to pursue him, but I don't know what his interests are,' he said. 'He's just a really good basketball guy. He's smart, he works really hard, he's positive. I've talked about our staff and how great they've been all year. Any of those guys would be good for opportunities like that. One thing I'm excited about is that I have a chance to work with those guys every day, because I learn more from them than they do from me.' Home or away The Celtics now have won nine of their past 10 home games.Though Stevens emphasized execution on the second night of back-to-backs, he doesn't feel the need to stress something similar about home or road performance. 'It's important to me, and I said at the lowest of points, that in here you represent yourself like a Boston sports team should and play the right way, with the right mindset, the right toughness,' he said. 'But I don't talk about home and the road other than that. But yeah, we'll happily ride the momentum of a home crowd. There's an expectation to play the right way here, and we expect that of ourselves. You make too big a deal of the road, and then you think you're going to get a better deal at home and that's not how it works. You make a big deal of home, and then you make the road out to be this unconquerable mountain. So you play 50-by-94 feet and try to play well.  'That's one thing I learned from my first coaches - don't make things bigger than they are.'",['ENGLISH'],609,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

43,"Newspaper, Newspapers",SPORTS,Basketball-Celtics,Celts show off moves,Dance to fifth win in a row,MARK MURPHY,"Gino made an appearance last night. Brad Stevens knows the cause of his cameos is a truly rare thing. 'It's nice when you have a game where you're making every shot, but that's one of those nights, and one of those nights is called that for a reason,' he said recently. 'You're not going to have it very often.' But after starting the game with a four-game winning streak comprised of grind-style basketball, the Celtics were apparently due to put Gino's disco video up on the Jumbotron.","They completed a season sweep of Philadelphia, all by double digits, with the 108-89 win, and never led by fewer than 16 points after the first quarter. The win briefly moved them into a tie with Indiana and Charlotte (which played last night) for the seventh playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings. All five starters cracked double figures, including a 20-point, 10-rebound double-double from Avery Bradley, and Gigi Datome and Jae Crowder each brought 10 points off the bench. The Celtics, after shooting as high as 70 percent in the first quarter, closed out shooting a clean 50 percent. Brandon Bass, who had lamented Saturday night at Indianapolis that he hasn't seen Gino for awhile, got his wish last night. Stepping into the old Kevin Garnett role, the Celtics forward put his arm around Gerald Wallace's shoulders and pointed up at the Jumbotron, dissecting the dance master's moves. The Celtics thus won their fifth straight game, and their seventh in the last eight. The C's started their fourth straight quarter with a burst, pushing out as far as a 25-point (95-70) lead before the Sixers resumed making shots. Though they eventually gave in to a stretch of sloppiness, the Celtics did enough to preserve the comfortable margin. Four straight points from Tyler Zeller (game-high 26 points), including a run at the rim off a high pick and roll, was good for a 103-82 Celtics lead with 2:57 left. Strong first halves have often been followed by flat third quarters this season, but not this time. The Celtics hit eight of their first 10 shots in the third, moved up by 23 points (75-52) on a Marcus Smart three-point play, and continued to simply have one of those nights. Zeller, who had a layup off a Bass feed during that stretch, popped out to the top of the circle to hit jumpers on back-to-back possessions for a 79-57 Celtics lead with 4:05 left. Bradley and Zeller each had 18 points at this point, and Smart became the fifth starter to crack double figures with a 3-pointer. Though the Sixers had finally struck a groove, too, with a 34-point third quarter, the Celtics were busy lighting up for a 32-point frame of their own. Though Philadelphia cut the Celtics' lead to 85-68 with 1:25 left, Crowder closed out the third with back-to-back hoops for an 89-68 Celtics lead. The Celtics, Saturday's high-quality win in Indianapolis tucked away, celebrated in the opening 12 minutes. They departed for the second with a whopping 38-18 lead after shooting 67 percent from the floor. Zeller and Bradley - the latter breaking out of a short slump - each had 10 points by the end of the quarter. Zeller was a perfect 4-for-4. Datome opened the second quarter with his second 3-pointer of the night, continuing to push the Celtics on to greater offensive things. By the time Bradley buried his third trey of the first half on the end of a 9-1 run, the Celtics led, 51-24. Evan Turner scored the Celtics' next six points, including a 15-foot turnaround for a 57-31 lead with 1:23 left. They led at the half, 57-34.",['ENGLISH'],583,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.

44,"Newspaper, Newspapers",INSIDE TRACK,The Inside Track,Video bust for Hub heist flick,,GAYLE FEE / INSIDE TRACK,"'The Forger,' the John Travolta-Christopher Plummer art-heist flick that was filmed in Boston almost two years ago, is finally getting a release - and it's going straight to video!","The film, about an aging art prodigy who has to steal a Monet from the Museum of Fine Arts and replace it with a forgery, will have an exclusive run on DirectTV starting March 26. Then it gets a limited theatrical release on April 24, and pops up on Video On Demand. 'The Forger' is the second flick with usually bankable stars to go direct to video this month. It follows 'Serena,' which stars two of the hottest names in Hollywood - Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper - down the on-demand route. And like 'Serena,' 'The Forger' languished unreleased for many months, and suffered from some less-than-enthusiastic reviews. The flick was filmed entirely in Boston in 2013 and a just-released trailer features shots of the Tobin Bridge, the MFA, a framed David Ortiz jersey and Travolta struggling with an on-again, off-again Boston accent. It debuted at last year's Toronto Film Festival and the critics were less than impressed. 'The opening shot in 'The Forger' is of a haggard John Travolta sitting in a prison cell, and the despair etched into his face suggests the actor might already be contemplating how wrong he is for this role,' said The Hollywood Reporter, which went on to call the flick 'a contrived thriller that wraps a gritty Boston milieu redolent of a Dennis Lehane story around a sentimental heart, with a high-stakes art heist that belongs in a more robustly plotted Hollywood studio picture.' Variety predicted that it would do weak business at the box office - which is the likely reason for the video release. 'Home-turf theatrical biz is likely to be flaccid,' said the show biz bible. 'Although cast names and genre elements will make this a viable, if uninspired, ancillary and minor theatrical item in most territories.' 'The Forger' was one of five high-profile projects to film in Massachusetts in 2013. 'American Hustle,' with the aforementioned Lawrence and Cooper; 'The Judge' with Robert Downey Jr.; 'The Equalizer' with Denzel Washington;and the HBO miniseries 'Olive Kitteridge' with Frances McDormand were all filmed around the same time as the Travolta flick, and all were released last year. 'The Forger' was one of the first films acquired by the newly formed Saban Films, which picked up domestic distribution rights it at the Toronto film fest for $2.5 million. The studio also bought 'Tracers,' starring 'Twilight' teenthrob Taylor Lautner, which also went direct to video. File Under: (On) Demand-ing Role.",['ENGLISH'],437,Copyright 2015 Boston Herald Inc.
