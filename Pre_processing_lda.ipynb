       "array([\"Vince Wilfork will be immortalized as a Patriot, but like so many, he won't be a Patriots lifer. The seven-time captain and five-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman signed with the Texans yesterday after a positive two-day visit with the Houston brass. Wilfork landed a two-year, $9 million contract, which included $5 million in guaranteed money, according to a source. And so ends Wilfork's 11-year run with the Patriots. The 2004 first-round pick opened his reign by surging to the top of the defensive tackle depth chart and becoming a fierce contributor for a Super Bowl champion. His tenure concluded with another victory on the world's greatest stage, and he was vindicated after returning from a torn Achilles while continuing as the defense's most prominent leadership presence. 'Few players reached or will ever reach the special level of Vince Wilfork,' Pats coach Bill Belichick said. 'He is a great champion and one of the classiest people I have ever been around, just a kind, genuine and giving person who was all about our team, football, winning and bringing joy to others. There may have never been anyone at his position with as much strength, toughness, intelligence, instinctiveness and athleticism. He is the best defensive lineman I ever coached, an all-time great Patriot whose place on our team will be missed but whose remarkable career as a Patriot will be remembered forever.' Wilfork was expected to take his time on the free agent circuit, but there was an obvious connection to Texans coach Bill O'Brien, defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel and linebackers coach Mike Vrabel, all former Patriots employees. He will now play alongside Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt and last year's No. 1 overall draft pick, Jadeveon Clowney. So, Wilfork made the quick decision after his first tour, spurning supposed interest from AFC contenders such as the Colts and Ravens. The Patriots declined Wilfork's option on March 5 for the 2015 and 2016 seasons, which saved $8 million against the cap in 2015. But because Wilfork never closed the door on a return in his initial statement and the Patriots hadn't acknowledged the transaction until last night, there was a popular belief the two sides could still indeed reunite. They mended fences after much more contentious negotiations in 2009, 2010 and 2014, and this split seemed amicable. 'I've been very blessed and privileged to play up there and learn from the best coach that has ever done it,' Wilfork said. 'Also, to play with one of the best quarterbacks that's in the game. From my teammates, there's nothing but love for them. They are brothers to me. The fans always treated me with respect. We had a lot of fun. I had a lot of fun in New England, and I'm going to cherish all of that. Because at the end of the day, I've been there for 11 years, so it's hard to close that door on my teammates, my fans, my coaches and the owner.' Wilfork is a shoo-in for the Patriots Hall of Fame, and those in and around the team fondly will remember the classy way he handled the past two weeks. Of course, Wilfork won't go wire-to-wire as a Patriot, just like Ty Law, Willie McGinest, Lawyer Milloy, Richard Seymour and Logan Mankins before him. The business side can often be football's reaper. Belichick has roamed NFL sidelines for 40 years, and he proclaimed to have never coached a defensive lineman better than Wilfork. That timeless impression will spark everlasting memories of Vince Wilfork.\",\n",

       "       \"Just when you thought we were done with emailgate, along comes James Carville to shed light on the matter. In defending Hillary Clinton's decision to use a private server for her emails, Carville on ABC's 'This Week' Sunday justified Clinton's actions as a 'reasonable' means of preventing the Republican Congress from 'rifling through her emails.' Wait. Rewind the tape. Didn't Clinton tell us that she set up the private server to avoid carrying two devices? And now Carville claims that she did it to hide from those nasty Republicans? Which is it? Clinton's excuse - that she sought to avoid fumbling with two phones - is laughable. Any kid can tell you that a single device is capable of displaying emails from multiple accounts and that professionals routinely set up their hand-held devices to do just that. Carville's excuse - that it is the GOP's fault - is classic Clintonian finger-pointing. By insinuating that Republicans have some sort of prurient interest in emails between Bill and Hillary Clinton, Carville makes Clinton's actions seem rational. After all, who among us would want our private communications spilled to the world?   But Carville's suggestion that Republican lawmakers were on some dystopian quest to monitor Clinton's private life is not only paranoid, but historically inaccurate - at the time Clinton set up her account on the private server, Democrats (not Republicans) controlled both houses of Congress (and thus the ability to subpoena State Department records). In truth, GOP lawmakers have not questioned Clinton's decision to use a private email account for truly private emails. Everyone does that. They have, however, raised questions about Clinton's decision to conduct government business on a private server - a server designed to keep things secret. (When did Hillary Clinton decide to become not just the secretary of state but the secretary of IT?) Carville's comments, while intended to hurt Republicans, inadvertently reveal the truth: Clinton created the account to avoid congressional oversight. (As part of its long-established authority to oversee federal agencies, Congress has every right to review government emails.) Upon becoming secretary of state, Clinton could have chosen to use a government email account for all communications. More appropriately, she could have chosen to use the government email for work matters and a separate private account for personal matters. She chose neither approach. Instead, Clinton set up a private server - not for administrative simplicity, but for political expedience. Clinton could not have known at that time what controversies lay ahead. But controversies she knew there would be. So she took measures to protect herself, knowing that when her decision to hide her emails eventually came to light, she could fall back on 'administrative convenience' and count on her ol' friend James Carville to blame any criticism of her Highness on the 'vast right-wing conspiracy.' This, of course, is strategy No. 1 in the Clinton playbook: Protect your political future at all costs, even if you have to break a few rules. After all, rules are technicalities that apply only to little people, not to the enlightened few who are destined to make the world a better place. That Clinton later instructed her minions to delete all so-called personal emails proves that her motive was not administrative but the avoidance oversight. Why, if one had a personal and secure server would one bother to delete all allegedly personal emails? The only plausible explanation is so that nobody can challenge whether those emails are, in fact, strictly personal. This controversy is about more than just transparency. It's about the character and modus operandi of HRC. And it's not pretty. Jennifer C. Braceras is a lawyer and political commentator. Talk back at letterstoeditor@bostonherald.com\",\n",

       "       \"With dirty snowbanks still lining many streets, Boston is looking at another month or more of grit, dirt and litter before the city begins street sweeping, leaving many businesses worried that all of the trash left behind by melting snow will turn off local customers and tourists. 'After this very tough winter for main streets, it is vital consumers be encouraged and welcomed back into our local stores and restaurants,' said Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts. 'Easter is April 5, and the spring shopping season has begun. The sooner the snow is gone, the streets are clean, all parking is back, and consumers feel like they can go downtown, not just to the mall, the better. A pleasant shopping environment is important to attract consumers who have mall and Internet options.' At a City Council hearing yesterday on the city's spring cleanup and street-sweeping strategy, Interim Public Works Commissioner Michael Dennehy said with all the snow that is still left, beginning street sweeping on the annual start date - April 1 - will likely be an 'impossibility.' So it's been postponed until curbs and gutters are free of ice and snow, Bonnie McGilpin, a spokeswoman for Mayor Martin J. Walsh, said, and the mayor's office will notify residents when street cleaning will resume once a date is finalized. In the meantime, McGilpin said, cars that park on the sides of a street that is posted for cleaning on certain weekdays beginning April 1 will not be ticketed. As the record 108.6 inches of snow that hammered Boston this winter melts, the city has been 'stuck with incredible amounts of trash,' Councilor Matt O'Malley said. 'We have to do better with trash pickup in the business districts, especially on the main streets,' said Michael Reiskind of Jamaica Plain Shines, an anti-litter campaign launched by the Jamaica Plain Business and Professional Association. Since last week alone, crews have hauled away about 200 tons of debris, Dennehy said. And from May 5, 2014, to last Friday, the city issued 58,000 tickets to people for putting trash out on the wrong day - compared to 38,000 tickets over the same period a year earlier - 'to deter bad behavior,' he said. 'Mayor Walsh and his team are doing everything they can to clear the streets of both snow and debris as quickly as possible,' said Paul Guzzi, president and CEO of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. 'It is a priority in every neighborhood, but it will take time.'\",\n",

       "       \"It's the 'Walking Dead'  'Quincy'/'Psych' mashup you didn't know you wanted. But give 'iZombie' a chance. You just might love it. CW, home to the DC Comics hits 'Arrow' and 'Flash,' dips into the medium again for this horror dramedy loosely based on the book from DC's mature reader imprint Vertigo. Dr. Olivia Moore (Rose McIver, 'Masters of Sex') - Liv Moore to her friends, get it? - could be a Meredith Grey clone as she saves patients and plans her wedding to her dreamy fiance, Major Lilywhite (Rob Buckley, 'One Tree Hill,' '666 Park Avenue').  One night, the super-overachiever decides to take a night off and go to a party on a boat.  What could possibly go wrong? The living dead crash the festivities.  In the mayhem, one (David Anders, 'Alias') scratches Liv.  Before you can say walker, biter, roamer or any other of those cute AMC euphemisms, she pops out of a body bag as a zombie.  She barely has a pulse. Her skin and hair turn the color of chalk.  Those aren't the worst parts. The worst part is the hunger for brains.  Afraid of hurting her loved ones, Liv dumps her fiance and spends the next six months essentially zoning out in front of the TV, becoming a different kind of zombie, a slacker. She reluctantly takes a job in the coroner's office, where it is almost an all-you-can-eat brains buffet. There, she discovers a few surprises. Her colleague, Dr. Ravi Chakrabarti (Rahul Kohli), guesses her secret - and is eager to help her find a cure for her condition. And whenever she eats the brains of murder victims, she experiences flashes of memory that she passes on to Detective Clive Babineaux (Malcolm Goodwin, 'Breakout Kings') to solve the crime. She tells him she's a psychic. He doesn't believe her - until her clues prove to be solid.  Another side effect of her new diet: She picks up the personality traits of the deceased. Next week, as she investigates the murder of an artist who had several lovers, she finds herself unwittingly, hilariously getting frisky with all sorts of the wrong people.  'iZombie' is superbly cast and displays wit and surprises you don't often find in the comics-to-TV genre (cough, 'Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,' cough). Series co-creator Rob Thomas ('Veronica Mars') knows something about creating lovable female detectives. McIver seems to be adept at everything. Kohli has terrific timing. Buckley finally has a role that allows him to show his range at both comedy and drama. He's devastating next week as Liv's personality flips wreak havoc on his heart.  The gore level, in case\\xa0 you're wondering, is so minor, it's almost negligible. You see more on 'Grey's Anatomy.' The murder mysteries, however, could be better developed. Tonight's is settled by one of the worst cliches in TV procedurals. To the show's credit, however, the mystery behind the zombie who attacked Liv takes a huge leap next week.  'iZombie' really is about one woman finding her determination to live again, regardless of her affliction. Not a bad premise for a show about a brain-muncher.\",\n",

Tonight's is settled by one of the worst cliches in TV procedurals. To the show's credit, however, the mystery behind the zombie who attacked Liv takes a huge leap next week.  'iZombie' really is about one woman finding her determination to live again, regardless of her affliction. Not a bad premise for a show about a brain-muncher.\",\n",
       "       \"FORT MYERS - It's not just the results, the confidence, the poise, the give-me-the-ball, I'm-not-going-to-lose attitude. It's all of that, combined into one.  Matt Harvey has it. The Red Sox don't have a Matt Harvey, and they received a good reminder of that yesterday for four innings by one of baseball's best pitchers. 'If (the New York Mets) want to give him up, we'd certainly welcome him,' Sox manager John Farrell said jokingly. Against the Red Sox' best, Harvey, in his second start since missing all of last season following October 2013 elbow surgery, was better. 'He looked good,' David Ortiz said after going 0-for-2 against Harvey. 'His slider - powerful.' In a playoff-like at-bat in the third inning, Harvey threw a high-90s heater up in the strike zone to Dustin Pedroia, then came back with a 3-2 changeup that disappeared before it reached the plate and made the former AL MVP look like a minor league extra, if just for one horribly sloppy swing. 'He's a great guy,' Harvey said. 'It was a fun battle.' Harvey's changeup was 88 mph. 'He got me,' said Pedroia. 'He looked great.' Harvey was dominant, shutting out the Red Sox while holding a lineup full of regulars to three hits over four innings. He struck out three and his fastball touched 94 mph in the first inning, 97 in the second and 98 in the third. And then there's the changeup, the curveball and the slider. 'To see the power and the shape to secondary pitches - he's a heck of a pitcher,' Farrell said. Pitchers like Harvey are the reason why Clay Buchholz had to go out and make T-shirts that say, 'He's the ACE,' for every starter in the Red Sox rotation. None of the Sox starters have taken the step that Harvey has, from passed-over high school pitcher (23 were taken ahead of him in the 2007 draft), to college mop-up man during his second year at North Carolina, to first-round draft pick in 2010, to Cy Young contender. 'There are only a few guys in that caliber,' pitching coach Juan Nieves said recently of staff aces. 'Everybody else falls into that lower one just underneath that.' Once quoted in Sports Illustrated as saying, 'I want to be that guy when they know you're starting against them, they go, 'Oh crap,' ' Harvey's persona fits with his career 2.39 ERA. But he's also aware that one pitcher won't win a World Series. The Mets are far from playoff favorites, even in an NL East that should provide plenty of opportunities to win. New York isn't a longshot, either, because of their starting pitching depth. 'I think if you look at all of our guys, they could be aces,' Harvey said. 'I think once Opening Day is out of the way, the whole ace thing isn't really in our minds. It's nice when you're considered an ace and facing an ace because you have to work harder and try to outduel them. For that, it's special.' In Buchholz, Rick Porcello or Justin Masterson, maybe even Wade Miley or Joe Kelly, who left yesterday's start in the third inning with biceps soreness, the Red Sox have pitchers capable of putting up a sub-3.00 ERA. Buchholz has been there before, if only for short stints, and he's looked the part of a No. 1 this spring. Or the Red Sox, with plenty of financial flexibility and prospects to move, could try to make a trade. With the class of talented starting pitchers that might be available in July, there will be plenty of options. But there are only a few guys like Matt Harvey. \",\n",

       "       \"The showdown with the bomb-tossing Tsarnaev brothers in Watertown brought everyone in federal court in Boston to the edge of their seats yesterday as police told of the face-to-face firefight. Watertown police Sgts. Jeffrey Pugliese and John MacLellan, along with patrolman Joseph Reynolds, said they found themselves in the Tsarnaevs' crosshairs when the brothers, fleeing an armed carjacking and the murder of MIT police officer Sean Collier, drew police into an ambush on Laurel Street in Watertown in the early-morning hours of April 19, 2013. 'We were about 6 to 8 feet at most from each other,' Pugliese, a firearms instructor, said of his confrontation with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who charged at the officer from the cover of a stolen Mercedes-Benz SUV. 'My pistol ran out of ammunition, and I had to reload in the middle of this battle. He was having problems with his (Ruger). I don't know if it jammed or ran out of ammunition. He looked at his gun, he looked at me, we looked at each other. I think out of frustration he threw the gun at me and it hit me in the left bicep,' Pugliese said. Leaving his then-19-year-old brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev behind crouching next to the Benz, Tamerlan ran straight at MacLellan and Reynolds, Pugliese said, but he tackled him to the ground facedown. 'The three of us were trying to get handcuffs on Tamerlan,' Pugliese said. 'I could hear an engine racing, and I saw the headlights moving toward me. It was accelerating at a very high rate of speed.' Dzhokhar, according to the officers, had gotten behind the wheel of the SUV and made a three-point turn.  'I reached down and grabbed Tamerlan by the back of the belt and I was trying to drag him out of the street. I was able to pull him about a foot,' Pugliese said. Finally heeding MacLellan's and Reynolds' screams for him to save himself, Pugliese recreated how he threw himself backward just as Dzhokhar ran over his brother.  'The front wheels went over Tamerlan. He got bounced up into the undercarriage,' he said. 'The vehicle dragged him about 35 to 40 feet. Tamerlan was hung up in the rear wheels.' As Reynolds fired a shot through the windshield, Tamerlan came loose as his brother plowed into Reynolds' empty cruiser, and then fled from the mayhem, later abandoning the SUV at Spruce and Lincoln streets. Tamerlan later died.  It was only after Dzhokhar vanished across the intersection with Dexter Avenue that investigators discovered responding transit police officer Richard 'Dic' Donohue bleeding to death in a driveway on Dexter from a stray bullet to his groin. Dr. Heather Studley, who treated Donohue at South Shore Hospital's emergency room, said he lost all 10 quarts of his blood and was technically dead for 45 minutes before being miraculously revived through transfusions, CPR and medication. \",\n",

       "       \"The Celtics' reputation continued to shine last night as one of the most improbable makeovers of the NBA season keeps looking prettier. They finished the proceedings in a three-way tie with Indiana and Miami for seventh playoff seed in the Eastern Conference, though the Pacers and Heat currently have tiebreaker edges thanks to better conference records. More importantly right now, though, the Celtics actually look like they belong there. 'I think they've improved a lot defensively since the last time we played them,' Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said after the Celtics swept the season series with a 108-89 win - their fifth straight, and their longest win streak of the Brad Stevens era. They have also won seven of their last eight and eight of their last 11. 'They've always had that firepower, the ability to score, but you can see a team that's right there to slide into the playoffs. We give them credit,' said Brown. Individual reputations are thriving, too. Tyler Zeller, who has quite possibly enjoyed the best two weeks of his NBA career, was given open space all night by the Sixers' reluctant big men, and he made them pay with a career-high 26-point, 11-for-15 performance. With Jared Sullinger out for the season, the seven-footer has popped out to mid-range to hit a steady diet of jumpers. Over the last two games Zeller has shot 19-for-25 as Indiana's Roy Hibbert and Philadelphia's Nerlens Noel have opted to give him open shots. '(The coaches) yelled at me a couple of times when nobody was within 5 feet of me and I didn't shoot it,' Zeller said of his progression this season. 'But with (Rajon) Rondo, if you can take a layup I'm going to take a layup over a jump shot. He does a great job of finding it. Now they've started packing it in recently, so now I'm trying to shoot it.' Zeller's contribution was only part of the Celtics' wave last night. They opened with a 38-point first quarter and never led by fewer than 16 points the rest of the way. The Celtics finished the game shooting an even 50 percent, including 40 percent (8-for-20) from 3-point range, and placed seven players in double figures, including all five starters. Avery Bradley broke out of a short slump with 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists, and Jae Crowder and Gigi Datome scored 10 each off the bench. 'It's nice when you have a game where you're making every shot, but that's one of those nights, and one of those nights is called that for a reason,' he said recently. 'You're not going to have it very often.' The event is also rewarding when it erupts like this. 'I think it's the continuity of the guys that have been here the whole time; they've really helped and really helped the way in a lot of ways,' Stevens said of his players, like Bradley, Brandon Bass and Zeller, who have survived the hailstorm of trades that rocked his roster this season. 'And then I just think our additions have been good; good, solid team guys that will compete, that are there helping each other and supporting one another,' said the Celtics coach. Players like Bradley can now claim they even saw this recent success coming. 'I saw that we were improving every single game and I knew we would have a chance if we set our mind to it and started speaking to it, and that's what we were doing,' said Bradley. 'We never thought we didn't have a chance to make the playoffs. Now we're right there.' And here's a bonus: The rest of the league is starting to notice.\",\n",

       "       \"A Monday night game in mid-March against the 76ers is grounds for no big whoop. Except when you're the Celtics and you've been granted, through good deeds of your own and grace of the Eastern Conference, admission to the playoff race . . . and you look at your itinerary and see a flight to Oklahoma City today and one from there to San Antonio later in the week. Then a date with the Philadelphians becomes a desperate, must-have, don't-leave-home-without-it outing. Lose this one, and even if Russell Westbrook gets a head cold tomorrow and Gregg Popovich decides to rest his first seven on Friday, you're still looking at a rough week. So it was comforting for the 'we don't need no stinking lottery pick' crowd that the Celtics went ahead by 22 in the first quarter and kept pushing all the way to a 108-89 victory. Maybe it was because Philly didn't push back all that much, but the C's avoided their fate from eight nights prior when they took a 20-point lead a minute into the second quarter in Orlando - and lost. Losing on your home floor to the team with the third-worst record in the NBA would have come packaged with a side order of insult. Then again, as Evan Turner put it after 10 points and five assists against his old team, 'Every loss really sucks. 'When we gave the game away in Orlando, that really sucked. When we gave the game away versus the Golden State Warriors, that really sucked. When we gave a game away versus the Kings, that sucked. If we would have taken care of those, we probably wouldn't have to worry too much. Now we need every win we possibly can get.' This victory means the Celts are assured of being in touch with Indiana, Miami and Charlotte in what is currently a four-team musical chairs competition for the last two playoff seats in the East. 'I just think all the games are ones we really need,' Turner said. 'We're in like a four-way tie every other day, so we can't really pick and choose. We need every single game we can possibly get.' Dining on the 76ers before meeting the Thunder and Spurs was akin to what many a wise person was doing on St. Patrick's Eve. Getting a little nourishment before hitting the hard stuff. 'Yeah, for sure,' Jae Crowder said. 'We are aware that we needed this win tonight. Now we just have to see how it plays out on the road.' After last night was in the books, coach Brad Stevens turned the page quickly. 'We're going on a tough road trip,' Stevens said. 'That's really all I'm thinking about right now.' Looking at the importance of this one in the postseason-drive scheme of things, Stevens said, 'I don't know. I haven't heard them talk about it once. I'm dead serious. I mean, we've talked about it. We've seen the standings, but I don't hear it. I have not heard them say whoever Miami's playing today, or who's Charlotte playing today? They haven't talked about it around me. Maybe they are; I don't know. 'But I just want to play good basketball. I think our guys just want to play good basketball, and I think as a result you have a lot more fun when you spray the ball around the way we're spraying it around and when you're competing together and pulling for one another and five guys playing together on a string defensively. And we're still not as good as we need to be, but I think our team that's out there right now without Isaiah (Thomas) can play better. And you know, we're going to need to play better in the next two games to have a chance to win.' The now 15-52 Sixers gave the Celtics very little chance to lose. No, the visitors are not exactly the pushovers they were last season, and, yes, they have quality wins over Cleveland and Atlanta, but the former came when the Cavaliers were without LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. The Philly fate was sealed before tipoff on opening night. There is no Selection Sunday for it to sweat. The NIT is not on line 2. In the third quarter, Avery Bradley cleanly removed the ball from Luc Mbah a Moute's hands as he drove. Bradley was, however, called for a shooting foul. Under normal circumstances, Bradley and the Garden crowd would be incensed. But, ahead by 20 points, no one had the heart to complain. It would have been unsportsmanlike to whine. The Celtics went ahead and completed the four-game season sweep of the Sixers, each win by double figures for an average margin of 14.75. Now the opponents become rather more frightening. 'How scary?' Crowder said. 'No, it's exciting. It's good basketball. We're playing the top teams. It's fun.' Crowder may be whistling past the dentist's office a bit on that one, for this will be a root canal of a road trip. Good thing the Celts flossed with Philly before they left.\",\n",

I think our guys just want to play good basketball, and I think as a result you have a lot more fun when you spray the ball around the way we're spraying it around and when you're competing together and pulling for one another and five guys playing together on a string defensively. And we're still not as good as we need to be, but I think our team that's out there right now without Isaiah (Thomas) can play better. And you know, we're going to need to play better in the next two games to have a chance to win.' The now 15-52 Sixers gave the Celtics very little chance to lose. No, the visitors are not exactly the pushovers they were last season, and, yes, they have quality wins over Cleveland and Atlanta, but the former came when the Cavaliers were without LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. The Philly fate was sealed before tipoff on opening night. There is no Selection Sunday for it to sweat. The NIT is not on line 2. In the third quarter, Avery Bradley cleanly removed the ball from Luc Mbah a Moute's hands as he drove. Bradley was, however, called for a shooting foul. Under normal circumstances, Bradley and the Garden crowd would be incensed. But, ahead by 20 points, no one had the heart to complain. It would have been unsportsmanlike to whine. The Celtics went ahead and completed the four-game season sweep of the Sixers, each win by double figures for an average margin of 14.75. Now the opponents become rather more frightening. 'How scary?' Crowder said. 'No, it's exciting. It's good basketball. We're playing the top teams. It's fun.' Crowder may be whistling past the dentist's office a bit on that one, for this will be a root canal of a road trip. Good thing the Celts flossed with Philly before they left.\",\n",
       "       \"FORT MYERS - One starting pitcher down, the Red Sox could turn to a knuckleballer to round out their staff. It all depends how Joe Kelly feels in the coming weeks. Kelly couldn't put any spin on the ball yesterday, when he felt biceps tightness in his right throwing arm during warmups and tried to pitch through it during a Grapefruit League game against the New York Mets. Kelly tried throwing mostly fastballs and changeups, but even that hurt. The final pitch came in the third inning, when Kelly already had allowed three runs on seven hits and the pain became too obvious for the Red Sox to ignore. Sox manager John Farrell and the training staff ran out to look at Kelly and immediately took him out of the game. 'Yeah, they saw me kind of shaking my arm a little more than usual and asked me what's wrong,' Kelly said. 'I said, 'My biceps (are) little tight and a little achy.' It progressively got a little bit worse.' Kelly said he's dealt with a similar issue in the past and gotten over it quickly. 'Usually it gets knocked out pretty quick,' he said. 'Just a little bit of work in the training room and not really a whole lot of rest. Just kind of got to get through it yourself and eventually it goes away.' As hopeful as the Red Sox are that Kelly won't have to miss time, this spring has been anything but fluid for the 26-year-old. He was throwing fastballs in the high-80s during his first start, and when he was asked if he had reached the high-90s in his second outing, Kelly candidly answered, 'That's probably false. My arm doesn't feel that good.' The Red Sox' sixth starter, should Kelly have to miss time, would likely be 30-year-old knuckleballer Steven Wright. Behind Wright, the Sox aren't exactly flush with starting pitching depth - their next-best option could be Matt Barnes, whose only major league experience came out of the bullpen, and a few highly regarded prospects who the Red Sox prefer not to rush to the majors. Wright was impressive in posting a 2.57 ERA over 21 innings with the Red Sox last year and has developed into a two-speed knuckleball pitcher who can consistently throw them for strikes. He walked just 22 batters in 95 innings with Triple-A Pawtucket last year. 'I feel like I'm ready for whatever job they want me to do, whether it's in Boston or Pawtucket,' Wright said. 'Hopefully it's in Boston at some point, but I feel confident to where if I just keep doing what I'm doing, working with (pitching coach Juan Nieves and former knuckler Tim Wakefield), I'm ready whenever they call upon me to go out there and compete.' Rusney's return on tap Rusney Castillo should be in the Red Sox lineup tomorrow. Castillo, who has been out since March 4 with a left oblique strain, has experienced no restrictions in his recovery. 'He's passed every baseball physical test that's we've put him in front of to date,' Farrell said. Still, it'll be an uphill climb for the 27-year-old to out-duel Mookie Betts for the starting center field job. After going 2-for-3, including a double high off the left-field wall against Matt Harvey, Betts is 10-for-23 this spring. Spring in his step He's usually seen carrying equipment bags and frequently shuttles between whichever minor league team needs a catcher most, but yesterday, Matt Spring had a moment to remember.

Spring, who has spent 11 years in the minors (the last four in the Red Sox organization) has never appeared in a major league game and played in just eight spring training games.

       "       \"FORT MYERS - The past two days have not been good ones for the Five Aces. In fact, after Justin Masterson and Joe Kelly were finished the past two afternoons - which didn't take long by the way, in either case - the skeptical might suggest the Red Sox rotation looked like three aces and two jokers. Much has been made of the Sox' insistence on entering the season without a definable 'ace,' the classic alpha dog starting pitcher the rest of the staff looks up to and can rely on to slam the brakes on potential losing streaks and carry the day in the clutch. Early in spring training, manager John Farrell went so far as to postulate that he had five No. 1 starters, while pitching coach Juan Nieves argued that at any particular stretch during a long season someone can emerge for a few weeks to serve as an ace of the moment before returning to his true self. At that point, one would guess, the hope is someone else makes a short-term appearance at that position until a real ace shows up. It's a good theory, but as far as a plan, one has to wonder about it. Sounds like something Pete Carroll might conjure up with the ball on the goal line and seconds left in the Super Bowl. But I digress. To add insult to injury, literally, Masterson was lit up Sunday by the Phillies, allowing seven hits, including two homers, and six earned runs. Kelly came back yesterday and gave up the identical number of hits, including two doubles in the second inning, and three earned runs in 22/3 innings before having to leave with a trainer by his side because of a balky biceps. We all understand that baseball is a marathon not a sprint. It is a long process of preparation and performance before anything is really decided definitively, so one should never put too much stock in either a strong outing or back-to-back circumstances where two of the Five Aces come up short. Yet these last two days give one pause to wonder anew whether the Sox have Five Aces or, like the hamburger joint, five guys. Yesterday one of them, Kelly, struggled with a biceps that began to tighten like a vice, quickly preventing him from throwing anything but fastballs. That might have worked at times for Nolan Ryan or Pedro Martinez, but in general not much good happens at the major league level when all you can throw is the same pitch over and over again. 'Warming up earlier my arm had a little bit of biceps tightness,' Kelly said. 'As the game progressed, it got more than tight. Basically I could only throw my fastball. I didn't think it was a big deal but it began to affect how the ball came out of my hand. I couldn't spin the ball. I thought it would work itself out. It didn't. I was getting hit around.' Indeed he was. Meaningless as it is when one has thrown so few innings, there's no questioning the fact Kelly's ERA at the moment is 11.05 and Masterson's is a less than masterful 6.48. At this stage of the spring, those are just numbers. But if you have lingering doubts that this insistence on saying they have Five Aces when in fact they have none may come back to haunt them, the last 48 hours did nothing to ease your concerns. Farrell, of course, has no concerns, which is the beauty of the man. If he was a golf pro who just shot 81, he'd say he struck the ball well but just didn't score. That's his role and his personality. It's a gift. His cup is always half-full and trending toward overflowing. So when asked if he had any worries either about Kelly's health or the Five Aces' future after a 4-3 win over the Mets yesterday, Farrell made clear none of this has led him to take Ambien to get to sleep at night. 'There's a process to go through (to prepare starting pitchers for the season),' Farrell cautioned. 'You can't skip any steps. Getting up and down, building their pitch count. Guys aren't always going to feel 100 percent on given days. You fully expect pitchers will go through ebbs and flows of arm strength in spring training. Some of our starters are going through a dead-arm period.' Fair enough, but are the Sox dead without an ace is the larger question? Hard to know, but if you were sitting in JetBlue Park on a sunny Monday afternoon watching a real ace, the Mets' Matt Harvey, mow down the Sox' lineup, you certainly understood the difference between Five Guys and one ace. Harvey, who is coming back from Tommy John surgery, scattered three hits over four innings, striking out three and allowing no runs. He was overpowering much of the time, reminding a crowd of 10,024 mostly Sox supporters that there is something still missing here in Fort Myers this spring, and it's not snow.\",\n",

Charlie Baker is standing by his MBTA skit at South Boston's St. Patrick's Day Breakfast - and doubled down last night at another holiday dinner in Lowell, where he mocked the transit agency's dysfunctional commuter rail line. 'It was an opportunity for all of us to sort of poke fun at ourselves, and let's face it, we all know it's been a long winter. The MBTA had some issues we worked pretty hard with them to fix,' Baker told the Herald last night. 'If you can't poke fun at yourself, you're not getting it.'  Baker drew some chuckles at the St. Patrick's Day fete in Lowell, when he joked that during the height of the storms he would be told a number of commuter rail engines were ready to go the next day - only to see that number shrink the following morning.  'I was like, what are these things, teenagers? 'I got up this morning, Dad looked at me kind of funny. I was out drinking last night. I'm sorry.' ... I wish I was kidding, but the simple truth is the main reason we had so much trouble with the commuter rail is because inside those big, brawny locomotives beats the heart of a 16-year-old,' Baker said.  'We've been doing everything we can to get them to grow up fast. We're told we have 50 of them ready to go tomorrow morning,' he said. 'As long as nobody has any exams - or nobody wants to celebrate St. Patrick's Day with their friends - we should be fine in the morning.'  Baker got mixed reviews Sunday when he appeared in a video with event emcee, state Sen. Linda Dorcena Forry, waiting for a late bus to take them to the breakfast. Departing T general manager Beverly Scott then pulls up behind the wheel and hopes out loud that there's 'absolutely no reason to put you in the back of the bus,' before telling the governor to 'buckle up.'

He didn't become the greatest pitcher of his generation, to say nothing of a first-ballot Hall of Famer, by virtue of having extreme self-confidence. The blazing fastball, knees-knocking curve, bat-slowing changeup (that might only be the nastiest pitch ever thrown) and the fearlessness to brush back any hitter undoubtedly had more to do with it. And after a week-long visit to fulfill his duties as a special instructor and assistant to general manager Ben Cherington, Martinez also must know the Red Sox lack a pitcher with real No. 1-starter bona fides. Jon Lester isn't walking through the clubhouse door. Neither is Philadelphia Phillies ace Cole Hamels, for whom the Sox made a trade offer that one MLB source recently labeled as 'poor.' It's difficult to imagine they won't eventually obtain such an alpha pitcher, especially with principal owner John Henry green-lighting a record payroll that will approach $200 million for luxury tax purposes. But in the meantime, it behooves everyone in the organization to help instill enough confidence in Buchholz, Porcello and the other starters that they believe any of them are capable of taking the lead. And that's the tune Martinez is singing. 'A guy like Hamels, like Lester, top-notch starters, they're welcome in any team,' Martinez said. 'But if they're not here, I would be saying, 'Hey, I'm capable. Hamels was once what I am today, so why not me?' That would be the question I would have. I think they have to walk around with that same attitude - why not me, or why not us? Why can't we all be aces?' So, Martinez loves the customized 'He's the ACE' T-shirts that Buchholz ordered and distributed to Porcello, Justin Masterson, Joe Kelly and lefty Wade Miley to wear around the clubhouse before games. It shows 'character,' he says, and demonstrates the attitude he believes the starters need to have. Of course, proven aces don't need T-shirts. When Mets right-hander Matt Harvey scaled the mound yesterday at JetBlue Park, everyone knew they were about to see one of the majors' best. The same went for Martinez in his 201 starts for the Sox from 1998-2004. 'Any one of these guys could be the stopper,' Martinez said. 'They were just never put in this spot. And this (Red Sox) team is no joke. This team is going to put up some runs. This team is going to produce for them.' Ironically, people were saying the same thing about the Red Sox 10 years ago, after Martinez left to sign with the Mets. With Curt Schilling injured, the 2005 Sox went through most of the season with an ace-less rotation that consisted of David Wells, Matt Clement, Tim Wakefield, Bronson Arroyo and Wade Miller, only one of whom (Wakefield) posted an ERA below the league average. That team won 95 games and made the playoffs on the back of an offense that scored 910 runs but got swept out of the playoffs by the Chicago White Sox' superior starters. Still, Martinez is bullish on the potential of this year's rotation. He's impressed by Kelly's talent, and noted that Masterson was the Cleveland Indians' best pitcher for much of the 2013 season.

William 'Mo' Cowan - a onetime board member of the state convention center authority - is an equity partner in an $800 million Seaport District hotel that's being proposed as part of the agency's controversial $1 billion expansion, the Herald has learned. Cowan, who also served as former Gov. Deval Patrick's chief of staff and chief legal counsel, and another former member of the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority's board, Dean Stratouly, both have ownership stakes in the Omni Hotel & Resorts-backed 'headquarters hotel' project. It is one of six bids to build a 1,000- to 1,200-room, $800 million hotel across from the convention center. Cowan was tapped by Patrick in February 2013 to replace John F. Kerry in the U.S. Senate until Edward J. Markey won the seat in a special election five months later.  Cowan told the Herald in an email he did not see any conflict being an equity partner in the hotel after serving on the board that will decide on his bid. 'I do not discuss my personal investment decisions,' said Cowan, now a lawyer at Mintz Levin, when asked how much money he has invested for his equity stake.  Cowan, who served on the board from February 2008 to November 2010, also confirmed he is friends with Greg Shell, husband of the panel's current chairwoman, Michelle A. Shell. Stratouly - who served on the MCCA board from February 1998 to June 2010, and chaired its building committee - also downplayed perceptions that his project might be looked on more favorably due to his longtime ties with the MCCA. 'I am not quite sure how it would be a conflict of interest given the amount of time that has lapsed for either me or Mo' since serving on the board, Stratouly said. 'The fact that I have spent time working on the convention center is widely known. And this is a new board that I don't have any relationship with. That board came in as we exited ... so I think enough time has lapsed that there is no holdover knowledge.' James Rooney, the MCCA's executive director, declined an interview request yesterday. But during a break at his board's expansion committee meeting Friday he denied any favoritism would be given to his two former board members. 'There is a process. I'm sure it will be a rigorous process that is devoid of who the players are,' Rooney said. 'It's a very rational process involving capacity to build a hotel, the design, the level of participation, and that is how they will be judged. I don't see that they have an upper hand at all. They will be tested just like the rest.' Neither Cowan or Stratouly have filed any conflict of interest disclosures with the State Ethics Commission or the MCCA.  State 'revolving door' laws permanently ban state 'employees,' including those who volunteer on boards, from becoming financially involved in projects they worked on while serving the state.  If the person did not directly work on the project but it fell under their official purview, there is a one-year cooling off period. Both Cowan and Stratouly have passed that period. The headquarters hotel is a '50-50 undertaking' between the MCCA and Massport, which owns the two vacant parcels bordering Summer and D streets where the hotel will be built. The MCCA said the first official action taken on the project came on June 20, 2013 - after both Cowan and Stratouly left - when both the MCCA and Massport boards approved a letter of intent to begin developing the hotel site.\",\n",

       "       \"Gino made an appearance last night. Brad Stevens knows the cause of his cameos is a truly rare thing. 'It's nice when you have a game where you're making every shot, but that's one of those nights, and one of those nights is called that for a reason,' he said recently. 'You're not going to have it very often.' But after starting the game with a four-game winning streak comprised of grind-style basketball, the Celtics were apparently due to put Gino's disco video up on the Jumbotron. They completed a season sweep of Philadelphia, all by double digits, with the 108-89 win, and never led by fewer than 16 points after the first quarter. The win briefly moved them into a tie with Indiana and Charlotte (which played last night) for the seventh playoff seed in the Eastern Conference standings. All five starters cracked double figures, including a 20-point, 10-rebound double-double from Avery Bradley, and Gigi Datome and Jae Crowder each brought 10 points off the bench. The Celtics, after shooting as high as 70 percent in the first quarter, closed out shooting a clean 50 percent. Brandon Bass, who had lamented Saturday night at Indianapolis that he hasn't seen Gino for awhile, got his wish last night. Stepping into the old Kevin Garnett role, the Celtics forward put his arm around Gerald Wallace's shoulders and pointed up at the Jumbotron, dissecting the dance master's moves. The Celtics thus won their fifth straight game, and their seventh in the last eight. The C's started their fourth straight quarter with a burst, pushing out as far as a 25-point (95-70) lead before the Sixers resumed making shots. Though they eventually gave in to a stretch of sloppiness, the Celtics did enough to preserve the comfortable margin. Four straight points from Tyler Zeller (game-high 26 points), including a run at the rim off a high pick and roll, was good for a 103-82 Celtics lead with 2:57 left. Strong first halves have often been followed by flat third quarters this season, but not this time. The Celtics hit eight of their first 10 shots in the third, moved up by 23 points (75-52) on a Marcus Smart three-point play, and continued to simply have one of those nights. Zeller, who had a layup off a Bass feed during that stretch, popped out to the top of the circle to hit jumpers on back-to-back possessions for a 79-57 Celtics lead with 4:05 left. Bradley and Zeller each had 18 points at this point, and Smart became the fifth starter to crack double figures with a 3-pointer. Though the Sixers had finally struck a groove, too, with a 34-point third quarter, the Celtics were busy lighting up for a 32-point frame of their own. Though Philadelphia cut the Celtics' lead to 85-68 with 1:25 left, Crowder closed out the third with back-to-back hoops for an 89-68 Celtics lead. The Celtics, Saturday's high-quality win in Indianapolis tucked away, celebrated in the opening 12 minutes. They departed for the second with a whopping 38-18 lead after shooting 67 percent from the floor. Zeller and Bradley - the latter breaking out of a short slump - each had 10 points by the end of the quarter. Zeller was a perfect 4-for-4. Datome opened the second quarter with his second 3-pointer of the night, continuing to push the Celtics on to greater offensive things. By the time Bradley buried his third trey of the first half on the end of a 9-1 run, the Celtics led, 51-24. Evan Turner scored the Celtics' next six points, including a 15-foot turnaround for a 57-31 lead with 1:23 left. They led at the half, 57-34.\",\n",

      "'Few players reached or will ever reach the special level of Vince Wilfork,' Pats coach Bill Belichick said. 'He is a great champion and one of the classiest people I have ever been around, just a kind, genuine and giving person who was all about our team, football, winning and bringing joy to others. There may have never been anyone at his position with as much strength, toughness, intelligence, instinctiveness and athleticism. He is the best defensive lineman I ever coached, an all-time great Patriot whose place on our team will be missed but whose remarkable career as a Patriot will be remembered forever.' Wilfork was expected to take his time on the free agent circuit, but there was an obvious connection to Texans coach Bill O'Brien, defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel and linebackers coach Mike Vrabel, all former Patriots employees. He will now play alongside Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt and last year's No. 1 overall draft pick, Jadeveon Clowney. So, Wilfork made the quick decision after his first tour, spurning supposed interest from AFC contenders such as the Colts and Ravens. The Patriots declined Wilfork's option on March 5 for the 2015 and 2016 seasons, which saved $8 million against the cap in 2015. But because Wilfork never closed the door on a return in his initial statement and the Patriots hadn't acknowledged the transaction until last night, there was a popular belief the two sides could still indeed reunite. They mended fences after much more contentious negotiations in 2009, 2010 and 2014, and this split seemed amicable. 'I've been very blessed and privileged to play up there and learn from the best coach that has ever done it,' Wilfork said. 'Also, to play with one of the best quarterbacks that's in the game. From my teammates, there's nothing but love for them. They are brothers to me. The fans always treated me with respect. We had a lot of fun. I had a lot of fun in New England, and I'm going to cherish all of that. Because at the end of the day, I've been there for 11 years, so it's hard to close that door on my teammates, my fans, my coaches and the owner.' Wilfork is a shoo-in for the Patriots Hall of Fame, and those in and around the team fondly will remember the classy way he handled the past two weeks. Of course, Wilfork won't go wire-to-wire as a Patriot, just like Ty Law, Willie McGinest, Lawyer Milloy, Richard Seymour and Logan Mankins before him. The business side can often be football's reaper. Belichick has roamed NFL sidelines for 40 years, and he proclaimed to have never coached a defensive lineman better than Wilfork. That timeless impression will spark everlasting memories of Vince Wilfork.\n"
