0,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,No. 1 LSU sees hope for maligned defense in SEC title game,,,"Link to Image Link to Image BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - LSU safety Jacoby Stevens and his defensive teammates sound determined to disprove the notion that they represent the top-ranked Tigers' greatest liability as college football's postseason arrives. Their most recent showing in a 50-7 victory over Texas A&M last weekend provided evidence that LSU's defense could bolster, rather than undermine, the unbeaten Tigers' chances against No. 4 Georgia in Saturday's Southeastern Conference championship.","""You hear all along the offense is great but the defense is not,"" Stevens said. ""As a competitor, you take that as motivation. You want to change that narrative, and I feel like we did that."" One game is a small sample size, but that sample was a promising display of dominance against an Aggies team that entered Tiger Stadium averaging 419.6 yards and 32.1 points per game. The Tigers allowed just 169 yards in a performance highlighted by six sacks - one for a safety - and three interceptions. LSU defensive lineman Rashard Lawrence was among several Tigers who mentioned being motivated partly by the College Football Playoff committee's decision last week to drop LSU in its ranking from No. 1 to No. 2 - behind Ohio State. Committee members mentioned that they viewed the Buckeyes as a more complete team that has performed well on offense and defense. ""We had a lot to prove,"" Lawrence said. ""We weren't really competing against Texas A&M. We were competing with ourselves and just having a four-quarter, physical, tough mindset."" Even LSU quarterback Joe Burrow said he noticed the sense of purpose pervading the Tigers' defense. ""The defense wanted to send a message to the country,"" Burrow said. ""They've been criticized for the last half of the season and that is what they were talking about all week."" Georgia's offensive numbers are similar to those of A&M's: 420.6 yards and 32.9 points per game, but the Bulldogs have seen their offense sputter at times in recent weeks. Georgia quarterback Jake Fromm has gone four straight games completing less than half of his passing attempts. Top receiver Lawrence Cager is out following ankle surgery, and Georgia's top healthy receiver, George Pickens, is suspended for first half of Saturday's game because of his ejection for fighting during the Bulldogs' victory last weekend over Georgia Tech. Also unclear is Georgia running back D'Ándre Swift's form after injuring his shoulder last week. But the Tigers don't want to become preoccupied with what is ailing the Bulldogs. LSU wants to avoid the lapses that has them ranked 35th nationally in total defense, giving up 345.9 yards per game, and 31st in scoring defense, allowing 22.1 points per game. ""The defense hasn't been playing right throughout the season,"" LSU edge pass rusher K'Lavon Chaisson said. ""We're thankful the offense is helping us out a lot. We were so grateful, but we know as a defense the offense can't save us every game and we need to pick it up."" Four times this season, LSU gave up at least 450 yards and 37 points. The first three instances occurred during victories at Texas, Vanderbilt and Alabama. The fourth occurred three games ago at Mississippi, when LSU allowed 614 yards. Stevens was among the LSU defensive veterans who lambasted his own unit after the Ole Miss game. He's since backed up his pledge to improve with three sacks against Arkansas and his interception against A&M. Chaisson had a sack-and-a-half against A&M and harassed Aggies QB Kellen Mond much of the night. ""There's too many high-caliber players on this defense to be disrespected,"" Chaisson said. The secondary is led by preseason All-America safety Grant Delpit and Stevens, along with cornerbacks Kristian Fulton and Derek Stingley Jr. The linebacker corps features Patrick Queen, known for his sideline-to-sidelined range, and Jacob Phillips, a stout tackler and strong communicator who relays defensive coaches' pre-snap instructions. Georgia coach Kirby Smart cited LSU's linebackers when explaining why he thought the Tigers were improving defensively. ""They played better and better, really aggressive,"" Smart said. ""They've created pass rush with their linebackers - and they're cover guys."" Chaisson, with 10 ½ tackles for loss, has led LSU up front. Lawrence, who missed three games with injuries this season, had a sack last week and appeared to be rounding back into form. Stevens said the most encouraging aspect of LSU's performance against A&M was the Tigers' ability to create pressure up front without resorting often to exotic stunts or blitzes. ""When you can do that, that's when you hit another level defensive-wise,"" Stevens said. ___ AP Sports Writer Charles Odum in Athens, Georgia, contributed to this report. ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and            https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",['ENGLISH'],805,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-JAYHEJDX5JEIFNNKETYBIKTZII,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Business & Corporate Compliance', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000126', 'className': 'ATHLETES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000081', 'className': 'AMERICAN FOOTBALL'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001452', 'className': 'RANKINGS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX001615', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000C9YJ', 'className': 'AMERICAN FOOTBALL TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST0009SE3', 'className': 'STADIUMS & ARENAS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}], 'city': [{'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GX564', 'className': 'BATON ROUGE, LA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS134', 'className': 'LOUISIANA, USA'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'GS151', 'className': 'OHIO, USA'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'GR215', 'className': 'SOUTHEAST USA'}]}"
1,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",POLITICS,,Read the House Intelligence Committee's full impeachment report,,,"Link to Image The following is the full impeachment report that the House Intelligence Committee released on Tuesday afternoon:  The impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election. As described in this executive summary and the report that follows, President Trump's scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign. The President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. To compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditioned two official acts on the public announcement of the investigations: a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary.","FULL TEXT During a July 25, 2019, call between President Trump and President Zelensky, President Zelensky expressed gratitude for U.S. military assistance. President Trump immediately responded by asking President Zelensky to ""do us a favor though"" and openly pressed for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden and the 2016 conspiracy theory. In turn, President Zelensky assured President Trump that he would pursue the investigation and reiterated his interest in the White House meeting. Although President Trump's scheme intentionally bypassed many career personnel, it was undertaken with the knowledge and approval of senior Administration officials, including the President's Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. In fact, at a press conference weeks after public revelations about the scheme, Mr. Mulvaney publicly acknowledged that the President directly tied the hold on military aid to his desire to get Ukraine to conduct a political investigation, telling Americans to ""get over it."" President Trump and his senior officials may see nothing wrong with using the power of the Office of the President to pressure a foreign country to help the President's reelection campaign. Indeed, President Trump continues to encourage Ukraine and other foreign countries to engage in the same kind of election interference today. However, the Founding Fathers prescribed a remedy for a chief executive who places his personal interests above those of the country: impeachment. Accordingly, as part of the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in coordination with the Committees on Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs, were compelled to undertake a serious, sober, and expeditious investigation into whether the President's misconduct warrants that remedy. In response, President Trump engaged in an unprecedented campaign of obstruction of this impeachment inquiry. Nevertheless, due in large measure to patriotic and courageous public servants who provided the Committees with direct evidence of the President's actions, the Committees uncovered significant misconduct on the part of the President of the United States. As required under House Resolution 660, the Intelligence Committee, in consultation with the Committees on Oversight and Reform and Foreign Affairs, has prepared this report to detail the evidence uncovered to date, which will now be transmitted to the Judiciary Committee for its consideration. PREFACE  This report reflects the evidence gathered thus far by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in coordination with the Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, as part of the House of Representatives' impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States. The report is the culmination of an investigation that began in September 2019 and intensified over the past three months as new revelations and evidence of the President's misconduct towards Ukraine emerged. The Committees pursued the truth vigorously, but fairly, ensuring the full participation of both parties throughout the probe. Sustained by the tireless work of more than three dozen dedicated staff across the three Committees, we issued dozens of subpoenas for documents and testimony and took more than 100 hours of deposition testimony from 17 witnesses. To provide the American people the opportunity to learn and evaluate the facts themselves, the Intelligence Committee held seven public hearings with 12 witnesses-including three requested by the Republican Minority-that totaled more than 30 hours. At the outset, I want to recognize my late friend and colleague Elijah E. Cummings, whose grace and commitment to justice served as our North Star throughout this investigation. I would also like to thank my colleagues Eliot L. Engel and Carolyn B. Maloney, chairs respectively of the Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform Committees, as well as the Members of those Committees, many of whom provided invaluable contributions. Members of the Intelligence Committee, as well, worked selflessly and collaboratively throughout this investigation. Finally, I am grateful to Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the trust she placed in our Committees to conduct this work and for her wise counsel throughout. I also want to thank the dedicated professional staff of the Intelligence Committee, who worked ceaselessly and with remarkable poise and ability. My deepest gratitude goes to Daniel Goldman, Rheanne Wirkkala, Maher Bitar, Timothy Bergreen, Patrick Boland, Daniel Noble, Nicolas Mitchell, Sean Misko, Patrick Fallon, Diana Pilipenko, William Evans, Ariana Rowberry, Wells Bennett, and William Wu. Additional Intelligence Committee staff members also assured that the important oversight work of the Committee continued, even as we were required to take on the additional responsibility of conducting a key part of the House impeachment inquiry. Finally, I would like to thank the devoted and outstanding staff of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, including but not limited to Dave Rapallo, Susanne Sachsman Grooms, Peter Kenny, Krista Boyd, and Janet Kim, as well as Laura Carey from the Committee on Foreign Affairs. * * * In his farewell address, President George Washington warned of a moment when ""cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion."" The Framers of the Constitution well understood that an individual could one day occupy the Office of the President who would place his personal or political interests above those of the nation. Having just won hard-fought independence from a King with unbridled authority, they were attuned to the dangers of an executive who lacked fealty to the law and the Constitution. In response, the Framers adopted a tool used by the British Parliament for several hundred years to constrain the Crown-the power of impeachment. Unlike in Britain, where impeachment was typically reserved for inferior officers but not the King himself, impeachment in our untested democracy was specifically intended to serve as the ultimate form of accountability for a duly-elected President. Rather than a mechanism to overturn an election, impeachment was explicitly contemplated as a remedy of last resort for a president who fails to faithfully execute his oath of office ""to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" Accordingly, the Constitution confers the power to impeach the president on Congress, stating that the president shall be removed from office upon conviction for ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" While the Constitutional standard for removal from office is justly a high one, it is nonetheless an essential check and balance on the authority of the occupant of the Office of the President, particularly when that occupant represents a continuing threat to our fundamental democratic norms, values, and laws. Alexander Hamilton explained that impeachment was not designed to cover only criminal violations, but also crimes against the American people. ""The subjects of its jurisdiction,"" Hamilton wrote, ""are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself."" Similarly, future Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court James Wilson, a delegate from Pennsylvania at the Constitutional Convention, distinguished impeachable offenses from those that reside ""within the sphere of ordinary jurisprudence."" As he noted, ""impeachments are confined to political characters, to political crimes and misdemeanors, and to political punishments."" * * * As this report details, the impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection. In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump's domestic political opponent. In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine. The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security. At the center of this investigation is the memorandum prepared following President Trump's July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine's President, which the White House declassified and released under significant public pressure. The call record alone is stark evidence of misconduct; a demonstration of the President's prioritization of his personal political benefit over the national interest. In response to President Zelensky's appreciation for vital U.S. military assistance, which President Trump froze without explanation, President Trump asked for ""a favor though"": two specific investigations designed to assist his reelection efforts. Our investigation determined that this telephone call was neither the start nor the end of President Trump's efforts to bend U.S. foreign policy for his personal gain. Rather, it was a dramatic crescendo within a months-long campaign driven by President Trump in which senior U.S. officials, including the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Acting Chief of Staff, the Secretary of Energy, and others were either knowledgeable of or active participants in an effort to extract from a foreign nation the personal political benefits sought by the President. The investigation revealed the nature and extent of the President's misconduct, notwithstanding an unprecedented campaign of obstruction by the President and his Administration to prevent the Committees from obtaining documentary evidence and testimony. A dozen witnesses followed President Trump's orders, defying voluntary requests and lawful subpoenas, and refusing to testify. The White House, Department of State, Department of Defense, Office of Management and Budget, and Department of Energy refused to produce a single document in response to our subpoenas. Ultimately, this sweeping effort to stonewall the House of Representatives' ""sole Power of Impeachment"" under the Constitution failed because witnesses courageously came forward and testified in response to lawful process. The report that follows was only possible because of their sense of duty and devotion to their country and its Constitution. Nevertheless, there remain unanswered questions, and our investigation must continue, even as we transmit our report to the Judiciary Committee. Given the proximate threat of further presidential attempts to solicit foreign interference in our next election, we cannot wait to make a referral until our efforts to obtain additional testimony and documents wind their way through the courts. The evidence of the President's misconduct is overwhelming, and so too is the evidence of his obstruction of Congress. Indeed, it would be hard to imagine a stronger or more complete case of obstruction than that demonstrated by the President since the inquiry began. The damage the President has done to our relationship with a key strategic partner will be remedied over time, and Ukraine continues to enjoy strong bipartisan support in Congress. But the damage to our system of checks and balances, and to the balance of power within our three branches of government, will be long-lasting and potentially irrevocable if the President's ability to stonewall Congress goes unchecked. Any future President will feel empowered to resist an investigation into their own wrongdoing, malfeasance, or corruption, and the result will be a nation at far greater risk of all three. * * * The decision to move forward with an impeachment inquiry is not one we took lightly. Under the best of circumstances, impeachment is a wrenching process for the nation. I resisted calls to undertake an impeachment investigation for many months on that basis, notwithstanding the existence of presidential misconduct that I believed to be deeply unethical and damaging to our democracy. The alarming events and actions detailed in this report, however, left us with no choice but to proceed. In making the decision to move forward, we were struck by the fact that the President's misconduct was not an isolated occurrence, nor was it the product of a naïve president. Instead, the efforts to involve Ukraine in our 2020 presidential election were undertaken by a President who himself was elected in 2016 with the benefit of an unprecedented and sweeping campaign of election interference undertaken by Russia in his favor, and which the President welcomed and utilized. Having witnessed the degree to which interference by a foreign power in 2016 harmed our democracy, President Trump cannot credibly claim ignorance to its pernicious effects. Even more pointedly, the President's July call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, in which he solicited an investigation to damage his most feared 2020 opponent, came the day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified to Congress about Russia's efforts to damage his 2016 opponent and his urgent warning of the dangers of further foreign interference in the next election. With this backdrop, the solicitation of new foreign intervention was the act of a president unbound, not one chastened by experience. It was the act of a president who viewed himself as unaccountable and determined to use his vast official powers to secure his reelection. This repeated and pervasive threat to our democratic electoral process added urgency to our work. On October 3, 2019, even as our Committee was engaged in this inquiry, President Trump publicly declared anew that other countries should open investigations into his chief political rival, saying, ""China should start an investigation into the Bidens,"" and that ""President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens."" When a reporter asked the President what he hoped Ukraine's President would do following the July 25 call, President Trump, seeking to dispel any doubt as to his continuing intention, responded: ""Well, I would think that, if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer."" By doubling down on his misconduct and declaring that his July 25 call with President Zelensky was ""perfect,"" President Trump has shown a continued willingness to use the power of his office to seek foreign intervention in our next election. His Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, in the course of admitting that the President had linked security assistance to Ukraine to the announcement of one of his desired investigations, told the American people to ""get over it."" In these statements and actions, the President became the author of his own impeachment inquiry. The question presented by the set of facts enumerated in this report may be as simple as that posed by the President and his chief of staff's brazenness: is the remedy of impeachment warranted for a president who would use the power of his office to coerce foreign interference in a U.S. election, or is that now a mere perk of the office that Americans must simply ""get over""? * * * Those watching the impeachment hearings might have been struck by how little discrepancy there was between the witnesses called by the Majority and Minority. Indeed, most of the facts presented in the pages that follow are uncontested. The broad outlines as well as many of the details of the President's scheme have been presented by the witnesses with remarkable consistency. There will always be some variation in the testimony of multiple people witnessing the same events, but few of the differences here go to the heart of the matter. And so, it may have been all the more surprising to the public to see very disparate reactions to the testimony by the Members of Congress from each party. If there was one ill the Founding Founders feared as much as that of an unfit president, it may have been that of excessive factionalism. Although the Framers viewed parties as necessary, they also endeavored to structure the new government in such a way as to minimize the ""violence of faction."" As George Washington warned in his farewell address, ""the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it."" Today, we may be witnessing a collision between the power of a remedy meant to curb presidential misconduct and the power of faction determined to defend against the use of that remedy on a president of the same party. But perhaps even more corrosive to our democratic system of governance, the President and his allies are making a comprehensive attack on the very idea of fact and truth. How can a democracy survive without acceptance of a common set of experiences? America remains the beacon of democracy and opportunity for freedom-loving people around the world. From their homes and their jail cells, from their public squares and their refugee camps, from their waking hours until their last breath, individuals fighting human rights abuses, journalists uncovering and exposing corruption, persecuted minorities struggling to survive and preserve their faith, and countless others around the globe just hoping for a better life look to America. What we do will determine what they see, and whether America remains a nation committed to the rule of law. As Benjamin Franklin departed the Constitutional Convention, he was asked, ""what have we got? A Republic or a Monarchy?"" He responded simply: ""A Republic, if you can keep it."" Adam B. Schiff Chairman, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  I. The President's Misconduct: The President Conditioned a White House Meeting and Military Aid to Ukraine on a Public Announcement of Investigations Beneficial to his Reelection Campaign The President's Request for a Political Favor On the morning of July 25, 2019, President Donald Trump settled in to the White House Executive Residence to join a telephone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. It had been more than three months since President Zelensky, a political neophyte, had been swept into office in a landslide victory on a platform of rooting out corruption and ending the war between his country and Russia. The day of his election, April 21, President Zelensky spoke briefly with President Trump, who had called to congratulate him and invite him to a visit at the White House. As of July 25, no White House meeting had materialized. As is typical for telephone calls with other heads of state, staff members from the National Security Council (NSC) convened in the White House Situation Room to listen to the call and take notes, which would later be compiled into a memorandum that would constitute the U.S. government's official record of the call. NSC staff had prepared a standard package of talking points for the President based on official U.S. policy. The talking points included recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine, a pillar of American foreign policy in the country as far back as its independence in the 1990s when Ukraine first rid itself of Kremlin control. This call would deviate significantly from that script. Shortly before he was patched through to President Zelensky, President Trump spoke with Gordon Sondland, who had donated $1 million to President Trump's 2016 presidential inauguration and whom the President had appointed as the United States Ambassador to the European Union. Ambassador Sondland had helped lay the groundwork for a very different kind of call between the two Presidents. Ambassador Sondland had relayed a message to President Zelensky six days earlier that ""assurances to run a fully transparent investigation"" and ""turn over every stone"" were necessary in his call with President Trump. Ambassador Sondland understood these phrases to refer to two investigations politically beneficial to the President's reelection campaign: one into former Vice President Joe Biden and a Ukrainian gas company called Burisma, on which his son sat on the board, and the other into a discredited conspiracy theory alleging that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. The allegations about Vice President Biden were without evidence, and the U.S. Intelligence Community had unanimously determined that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 election to help the candidacy of Donald Trump. Despite the falsehoods, Ambassador Sondland would make it clear to Ukrainian officials that the public announcement of these investigations was a prerequisite for the coveted White House meeting with President Trump, an effort that would help the President's reelection campaign. The White House meeting was not the only official act that President Trump conditioned on the announcement of these investigations. Several weeks before his phone call with President Zelensky, President Trump ordered a hold on nearly $400 million of congressionally-appropriated security assistance to Ukraine that provided Kyiv essential support as it sought to repel Russian forces that were occupying Crimea and inflicting casualties in the eastern region of the country. The President's decision to freeze the aid, made without explanation, sent shock waves through the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of State, and the NSC, which uniformly supported providing this assistance to our strategic partner. Although the suspension of aid had not been made public by the day of the call between the two Presidents, officials at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington had already asked American officials about the status of the vital military assistance. At the outset of the conversation on July 25, President Zelensky thanked President Trump for the ""great support in the area of defense"" provided by the United States to date. He then indicated that Ukraine would soon be prepared to purchase additional Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States as part of this defense cooperation. President Trump immediately responded with his own request: ""I would like you to do us a favor though,"" which was ""to find out what happened"" with alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. President Trump then asked President Zelensky ""to look into"" former Vice President Biden's role in encouraging Ukraine to remove a prosecutor widely viewed by the United States and numerous European partners to be corrupt. In so doing, President Trump gave currency to a baseless allegation that Vice President Biden wanted to remove the corrupt prosecutor because he was investigating Burisma, a company on whose board the Vice President's son sat at the time. Over the course of the roughly thirty-minute call, President Trump repeated these false allegations and pressed the Ukrainian President to consult with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who had been publicly advocating for months for Ukraine to initiate these specific investigations. President Zelensky promised that he would ""work on the investigation of the case."" Later in the call, he thanked President Trump for his invitation to join him at the White House, following up immediately with a comment that, ""[o]n the other hand,"" he would ""ensure"" that Ukraine pursued ""the investigation"" that President Trump had requested. During the call, President Trump also disparaged Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who championed anti-corruption reforms in the country, and whom President Trump had unceremoniously removed months earlier following a smear campaign waged against her by Mr. Giuliani and others. President Trump claimed that she was ""bad news"" and was ""going to go through some things."" He praised the current prosecutor at the time, who was widely viewed as corrupt and who helped initiate the smear campaign against her, calling him ""very good"" and ""very fair."" Hearing the call as it transpired, several White House staff members became alarmed. Far from giving the ""full-throated endorsement of the Ukraine reform agenda"" that had been hoped for, the President instead demanded a political investigation into an American-the presidential candidate he evidently feared most, Joe Biden. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, an NSC staff member responsible for Ukraine policy who listened to the call, immediately reported his concerns to NSC lawyers. His supervisor, NSC Senior Director for Europe and Russia Timothy Morrison, also reported the call to the lawyers, worrying that the call would be ""damaging"" if leaked publicly. In response, the lawyers placed the memorandum summarizing the call onto a highly classified server, significantly limiting access to the materials. The call record would not remain hidden forever. On September 25, 2019, facing immense public pressure to reveal the contents of the call and following the announcement the previous day of a formal impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives into President Trump's actions toward Ukraine, the White House publicly released the memorandum of the July 25 call. The record of the call would help explain for those involved in Ukraine policy in the U.S. government, the Congress, and the public why President Trump, his personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani, his hand-picked appointees in charge of Ukraine issues, and various senior Administration officials would go to great lengths to withhold a coveted White House meeting and critical military aid from Ukraine at a time when it served as a bulwark against Russian aggression in Europe. The answer was as simple as it was inimical to our national security and election integrity: the President was withholding officials acts while soliciting something of value to his reelection campaign-an investigation into his political rival. The story of that scheme follows. The President Removed Anti-Corruption Champion Ambassador Yovanovitch On April 24, 2019, President Donald Trump abruptly called back to Washington the United States Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie ""Masha"" Yovanovitch, after a ruthless smear campaign was waged against her. She was known throughout Ukraine and among her peers for aggressively advocating for anti-corruption reforms consistent with U.S. foreign policy and only recently had been asked to extend her stay in Ukraine. Her effectiveness in anti-corruption efforts earned her enemies in Kyiv and in Washington. As Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent testified in praising Ambassador Yovanovitch: ""You can't promote principled anticorruption action without pissing off corrupt people."" Beginning on March 20, The Hill newspaper published several op-eds attacking Ambassador Yovanovitch and former Vice President Joe Biden, relying on information from a Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who was widely viewed to be corrupt. Mr. Lutsenko had served as the chief prosecutor in Ukraine under the then-incumbent president who lost to Volodymyr Zelensky in April 2019. Although he would later recant many of his allegations, Mr. Lutsenko falsely accused Ambassador Yovanovitch of speaking negatively about President Trump and giving Mr. Lutsenko a ""do-not-prosecute list."" The attacks against Ambassador Yovanovitch were amplified by prominent, close allies of President Trump, including Mr. Giuliani and his associates, Sean Hannity, and Donald Trump Jr. President Trump tweeted the smears himself just a month before he recalled the Ambassador from Ukraine. In the face of attacks driven by Mr. Lutsenko and the President's allies, Ambassador Yovanovitch and other senior State Department officials asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to issue a statement of support for her and for the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. The Secretary declined, fearing that President Trump might publicly undermine those efforts, possibly through a tweet. Following a ceremony in which she presented an award of courage to the family of a young female anti-corruption activist killed in Ukraine for her work, Ambassador Yovanovitch received an urgent call from the State Department regarding her ""security,"" and imploring her to take the first plane back to Washington. When she arrived, she was informed that she had done nothing wrong, but that the President had lost confidence in her. She was told to leave her post as soon as possible. In her place, the President would designate three new agents to spearhead Ukraine policy, political appointees far more willing to engage in an improper ""domestic political errand"" than an ambassador known for her efforts to fight corruption. The President's Hand-picked Agents Begin the Scheme Just three days before Ambassador Yovanovitch's abrupt recall to Washington, President Trump had his first telephone call with President-elect Zelensky. During that conversation, President Trump congratulated the Ukrainian leader on his victory, complimented him on his country's Miss Universe Pageant contestants, and invited him to visit the White House. A White House meeting would help demonstrate the United States' strong support for Ukraine as it fought a hot war with Russia and attempted to negotiate an end to the conflict with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as to bolster President-elect Zelensky's standing with his own people as he sought to deliver on his promised anti-corruption agenda. Although the White House's public summary of the call included some discussion of a commitment to ""root out corruption,"" President Trump did not mention corruption at all. Shortly after the conversation, President Trump asked Vice President Mike Pence to attend President Zelensky's inauguration. Vice President Pence confirmed directly to President Zelensky his intention to attend during a phone conversation on April 23, and Vice President Pence's staff and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv began preparations for the trip. At the same time, President Trump's personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani, intensified his campaign to pressure Ukraine's newly-elected President to initiate investigations into Joe Biden, who had officially entered the race for the Democratic nomination on April 25, and the baseless conspiracy theory about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. On May 9, the New York Times published an article in which Mr. Giuliani declared that he intended to travel to Ukraine on behalf of his client, President Trump, in order to meddle in an investigation. After public backlash, Mr. Giuliani canceled the trip, blaming ""some bad people"" around President Zelensky. Days later, President Trump rescinded the plans for Vice President Pence to attend President Zelensky's inauguration, which had not yet been scheduled. The staff member planning the trip was not provided an explanation for the about-face, but staff in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv were disappointed that President Zelensky would not receive a ""high level"" show of support from the United States. In Vice President Pence's stead, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry led the American delegation to the Ukrainian President's inauguration. Ambassador Sondland, Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Ambassador Kurt Volker, and Lt. Col. Vindman also attended. In comments that would foreshadow troubling events to come, Lt. Col. Vindman warned President Zelensky to stay out of U.S. domestic politics to avoid jeopardizing the bipartisan support Ukraine enjoyed in Congress. The delegation returned to the United States impressed with President Zelensky, especially his focus on anti-corruption reforms. Ambassador Sondland quickly organized a meeting with President Trump in the Oval Office on May 23, attended by most of the other members of the delegation. The three political appointees, who would describe themselves as the ""Three Amigos,"" relayed their positive impression of President Zelensky to President Trump and encouraged him to schedule the Oval Office meeting he promised in his April 21 phone call with the new leader. President Trump reacted poorly to the suggestion, claiming that Ukraine ""tried to take me down"" in 2016. In order to schedule a White House visit for President Zelensky, President Trump told the delegation that they would have to ""talk to Rudy."" Ambassador Sondland testified that he understood the President's instruction to be a directive to work with Mr. Giuliani if they hoped to advance relations with Ukraine. President Trump directed the three senior U.S. government officials to assist Mr. Giuliani's efforts, which, it would soon become clear, were exclusively for the benefit of the President's reelection campaign. As the Three Amigos were given responsibility over the U.S. government's Ukraine portfolio, Bill Taylor, a former Ambassador to Ukraine, was considering whether to come out of retirement to accept a request to succeed Ambassador Yovanovitch in Kyiv. As of May 26, Ambassador Taylor was ""still struggling with the decision,"" and, in particular, whether anyone can ""hope to succeed with the Giuliani-Biden issue swirling."" After receiving assurances from Secretary Pompeo that U.S. policy toward Ukraine would not change, Ambassador Taylor accepted the position and arrived in Kyiv on June 17. Ambassador Taylor would quickly come to observe an ""irregular channel"" led by Mr. Giuliani that, over time, began to undermine the official channel of diplomatic relations with Ukraine. Mr. Giuliani would prove to be, as the President's National Security Advisor Ambassador John Bolton would tell a colleague, a ""hand grenade that was going to blow everyone up."" President Trump Froze Vital Military Assistance For fiscal year 2019, Congress appropriated and authorized $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine: $250 million in funds administered by DOD and $141 million in funds administered by the State Department. On June 18, DOD issued a press release announcing its intention to provide $250 million in taxpayer-funded security assistance to Ukraine following the certification that all legitimate conditions on the aid, including anti-corruption reforms, had been met. Shortly after this announcement, however, both the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and DOD received inquiries from the President related to the funds. At that time, and throughout the next few months, support for Ukraine security assistance was overwhelming and unanimous among all of the relevant agencies and within Congress. By July 3, OMB blocked a Congressional notification which would have cleared the way for the release of $141 million in State Department security assistance funds. By July 12, President Trump had placed a hold on all military support funding for Ukraine. On July 18, OMB announced the hold to all of the relevant agencies and indicated that it was directed by the President. No other reason was provided. During a series of policy meetings involving increasingly senior officials, the uniform and consistent position of all policymaking agencies supported the release of funding. Ukraine experts at DOD, the State Department, and the NSC argued that it was in the national security interest of the United States to continue to support Ukraine. As Mr. Morrison testified, ""The United States aids Ukraine and her people so that they can fight Russia over there, and we don't have to fight Russia here."" Agency officials also expressed concerns about the legality of President Trump's direction to withhold assistance to Ukraine that Congress had already appropriated for this express purpose. Two OMB career officials, including one of its legal counsels, would resign, in part, over concerns regarding the hold. By July 25, the date of President Trump's call with President Zelensky, DOD was also receiving inquiries from Ukrainian officials about the status of the security assistance. Nevertheless, President Trump continued to withhold the funding to Ukraine without explanation, against the interests of U.S. national security, and over the objections of these career experts. The President Conditioned a White House Meeting on Investigations By the time Ukrainian officials were first learning about an issue with the anticipated military assistance, the President's hand-picked representatives to Ukraine had already informed their Ukrainian counterparts that President Zelensky's coveted White House meeting would only happen after Ukraine committed to pursuing the two political investigations that President Trump and Mr. Giuliani demanded. Ambassador Sondland was unequivocal in describing this conditionality, testifying, ""I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes."" Ambassadors Sondland and Volker worked to obtain the necessary assurance from President Zelensky that he would personally commit to initiate the investigations in order to secure both. On July 2, in Toronto, Canada, Ambassador Volker conveyed the message directly to President Zelensky, specifically referencing the ""Giuliani factor"" in President Zelensky's engagement with the United States. For his part, Mr. Giuliani made clear to Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, who were directly communicating with the Ukrainians, that a White House meeting would not occur until Ukraine announced its pursuit of the two political investigations. After observing Mr. Giuliani's role in the ouster of a U.S. Ambassador and learning of his influence with the President, Ukrainian officials soon understood that ""the key for many things is Rudi [sic]."" On July 10, Ambassador Bolton hosted a meeting in the White House with two senior Ukrainian officials, several American officials, including Ambassadors Sondland and Volker, Secretary Perry, Dr. Fiona Hill, Senior Director for Europe and Russia at the NSC, and Lt. Col. Vindman. As had become customary each time Ukrainian officials met with their American counterparts, the Ukrainians asked about the long-delayed White House meeting. Ambassador Bolton demurred, but Ambassador Sondland spoke up, revealing that he had worked out an arrangement with Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to schedule the White House visit after Ukraine initiated the ""investigations."" Ambassador Bolton ""stiffened"" and quickly ended the meeting. Undaunted, Ambassador Sondland ushered many of the attendees to the Ward Room downstairs to continue their discussion. In the second meeting, Ambassador Sondland explained that he had an agreement with Mr. Mulvaney that the White House visit would come only after Ukraine announced the Burisma/Biden and 2016 Ukraine election interference investigations. At this second meeting, both Lt. Col. Vindman and Dr. Hill objected to intertwining a ""domestic political errand"" with official foreign policy, and they indicated that a White House meeting would have to go through proper channels. Following these discussions, Dr. Hill reported back to Ambassador Bolton, who told her to ""go and tell [the NSC Legal Advisor] that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this."" Both Dr. Hill and Lt. Col. Vindman separately reported the incident to the NSC Legal Advisor. The President's Agents Pursued a ""Drug Deal"" Over the next two weeks, Ambassadors Sondland and Volker worked closely with Mr. Giuliani and senior Ukrainian and American officials to arrange a telephone call between President Trump and President Zelensky and to ensure that the Ukrainian President explicitly promised to undertake the political investigations required by President Trump to schedule the White House meeting. As Ambassador Sondland would later testify: ""Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States, and we knew these investigations were important to the President."" On July 19, Ambassador Volker had breakfast with Mr. Giuliani and his associate, Lev Parnas, at the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C. Mr. Parnas would subsequently be indicted for campaign finance violations as part of an investigation that remains ongoing. During the conversation, Ambassador Volker stressed his belief that the attacks being leveled publicly against Vice President Biden related to Ukraine were false and that the former Vice President was ""a person of integrity."" He counseled Mr. Giuliani that the Ukrainian prosecutor pushing the false narrative, Mr. Lutsenko, was promoting ""a self-serving narrative to preserve himself in power."" Mr. Giuliani agreed, but his promotion of Mr. Lutsenko's false accusations for the benefit of President Trump did not cease. Ambassador Volker also offered to help arrange an in-person meeting between Mr. Giuliani and Andriy Yermak, one of President Zelensky's most trusted advisors, which would later take place in Madrid, Spain in early August. After the breakfast meeting at the Trump Hotel, Ambassador Volker reported back to Ambassadors Sondland and Taylor about his conversation with Mr. Giuliani, writing in a text message that, ""Most impt [sic] is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation-and address any specific personnel issues-if there are any,"" likely referencing President Zelensky's decision to remove Mr. Lutsenko as prosecutor general, a decision with which Mr. Giuliani disagreed. The same day, Ambassador Sondland spoke with President Zelensky and recommended that the Ukrainian leader tell President Trump that he ""will leave no stone unturned"" regarding the political investigations during the upcoming presidential phone call. Ambassador Sondland emailed several top Administration officials, including Secretary of State Pompeo, Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and Secretary Perry, stating that President Zelensky confirmed that he would ""assure"" President Trump that ""he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will 'turn over every stone.'"" According to Ambassador Sondland, he was referring in the email to the Burisma/Biden and 2016 election interference investigations. Secretary Perry and Mr. Mulvaney responded affirmatively that the call would soon take place, and Ambassador Sondland testified later that ""everyone was in the loop"" on plans to condition the White House meeting on the announcement of political investigations beneficial to President Trump. The arrangement troubled the Ukrainian President, who ""did not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. reelection campaign."" The President Pressed Zelensky to Do a Political Favor On the morning of July 25, Ambassador Volker sent a text message to President Zelensky's top aide, Mr. Yermak, less than 30 minutes before the presidential call. He stated: ""Heard from White House-assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington. Good luck!"" Shortly before the call, Ambassador Sondland spoke directly with President Trump. President Zelensky followed this advice during his conversation with President Trump. President Zelensky assured that he would pursue the investigations that President Trump had discussed-into the Bidens and 2016 election interference-and, in turn, pressed for the White House meeting that remained outstanding. The following day, Ambassadors Volker, Sondland, and Taylor met with President Zelensky in Kyiv. The Ukrainian President told them that President Trump had mentioned ""sensitive issues"" three times during the previous day's phone call. Following the meeting with the Ukrainian leader, Ambassador Sondland had a private, one-on-one conversation with Mr. Yermak in which they discussed ""the issue of investigations."" He then retired to lunch at an outdoor restaurant terrace with State Department aides where he called President Trump directly from his cellphone. The White House confirmed that the conversation lasted five minutes. At the outset of the call, President Trump asked Ambassador Sondland whether President Zelensky ""was going to do the investigation"" that President Trump had raised with President Zelensky the day before. Ambassador Sondland stated that President Zelensky was ""going to do it"" and ""would do anything you ask him to."" According to David Holmes, the State Department aide sitting closest to Ambassador Sondland and who overheard the President's voice on the phone, Ambassador Sondland and President Trump spoke only about the investigation in their discussion about Ukraine. The President made no mention of other major issues of importance in Ukraine, including President Zelensky's aggressive anti-corruption reforms and the ongoing war it was fighting against Russian-led forces in eastern Ukraine. After hanging up the phone, Ambassador Sondland explained to Mr. Holmes that President Trump ""did not give a shit about Ukraine."" Rather, the President cared only about ""big stuff"" that benefitted him personally, like ""the Biden investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pitching,"" and that President Trump had pushed for in his July 25 call with the Ukrainian leader. Ambassador Sondland did not recall referencing Biden specifically, but he did not dispute Mr. Holmes' recollection of the call with the President or Ambassador Sondland's subsequent discussion with Mr. Holmes. The President's Representatives Ratcheted up Pressure on the Ukrainian President In the weeks following the July 25 call, the President's hand-picked representatives increased the President's pressure campaign on Ukrainian government officials-in person, over the phone, and by text message-to secure a public announcement of the investigations beneficial to President Trump's reelection campaign. In discussions with Ukrainian officials, Ambassador Sondland understood that President Trump did not require that Ukraine conduct investigations as a prerequisite for the White House meeting so much as publicly announce the investigations-making clear that the goal was not the investigations, but the political benefit Trump would derive from their announcement and the cloud they might put over a political opponent. On August 2, President Zelensky's advisor, Mr. Yermak, traveled to Madrid to meet Mr. Giuliani in person. There, they agreed that Ukraine would issue a public statement, and they discussed potential dates for a White House meeting. A few days later, Ambassador Volker told Mr. Giuliani that it ""would be good"" if Mr. Giuliani would report to ""the boss,"" President Trump, about ""the results"" of his Madrid discussion so that President Trump would finally agree to a White House visit by President Zelensky. On August 9, Ambassador Volker and Mr. Giuliani spoke twice by phone, and Ambassador Sondland spoke twice to the White House for a total of about 20 minutes. In a text message to Ambassador Volker later that day, Ambassador Sondland wrote, ""I think potus [sic] really wants the deliverable,"" which Ambassador Sondland acknowledged was the public statement announcing the two political investigations sought by President Trump and Mr. Giuliani. The following day, Ambassador Sondland briefed State Department Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, a top advisor to Secretary Pompeo, on these discussions about President Zelensky issuing a statement that would include an announcement of the two political investigations. Ambassador Sondland also emailed Secretary Pompeo directly, copying the State Department's executive secretary and Mr. Brechbuhl, to inform them about the agreement for President Zelensky to give the press conference. He expected to see a draft of the statement, which would be ""delivered for our review in a day or two."" Ambassador Sondland noted his hope that the draft statement would ""make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation."" On August 12, Mr. Yermak sent the proposed statement to Ambassador Volker, but it lacked specific references to the two investigations politically beneficial to President Trump's reelection campaign. The following morning, Ambassadors Sondland and Volker spoke with Mr. Giuliani, who made clear that if the statement ""doesn't say Burisma and 2016, it's not credible."" Ambassador Volker revised the statement following this direction to include those references and returned it to the Ukrainian President's aide. Mr. Yermak balked at getting drawn into U.S. politics and asked Ambassador Volker whether the United States had inquired about investigations through any appropriate Department of Justice channels. The answer was no, and several witnesses testified that a request to a foreign country to investigate a U.S. citizen ""for political reasons"" goes ""against everything"" the United States sought to promote in eastern Europe, specifically the rule of law. Ambassador Volker eventually agreed with Mr. Yermak that the announcement of the Biden/Burisma and 2016 elections investigations would ""look like it would play into our domestic politics,"" so the statement was temporarily ""shelved."" Nevertheless, Ambassador Sondland, in accordance with President Trump's wishes, continued to pursue the statement into early September 2019. Ukrainians Inquired about the President's Hold on Security Assistance Once President Trump placed security assistance on hold in July, ""it was inevitable that it was eventually going to come out."" On July 25, DOD officials learned that diplomats at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington had made multiple overtures to DOD and the State Department ""asking about security assistance."" Separately, two different contacts at the Ukrainian Embassy approached Ambassador Volker's special advisor, Catherine Croft, to ask her in confidence about the hold. Ms. Croft was surprised at the effectiveness of their ""diplomatic tradecraft,"" noting that they ""found out very early on"" that the United States was withholding critical military aid to Ukraine. By mid-August, before the freeze on aid became public, Lt. Col. Vindman had also received inquiries from an official at the Ukrainian Embassy. The hold remained in place throughout August against the unanimous judgment of American officials focused on Ukraine policy. Without an explanation for the hold, which ran contrary to the recommendation of all relevant agencies, and with President Trump already conditioning a White House visit on the announcement of the political investigations, it became increasingly apparent to multiple witnesses that the military aid was also being withheld in exchange for the announcement of those. As both Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Holmes would later testify, it became as clear as ""two plus two equals four."" On August 22, Ambassador Sondland emailed Secretary Pompeo again, recommending a plan for a potential meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky in Warsaw, Poland on September 1. Ambassador Sondland noted that President Zelensky should ""look him in the eye"" and tell President Trump that once new prosecutorial officials were in place in Ukraine, ""Zelensky should be able to move forward publicly and with confidence on those issues of importance to Potus and the U.S."" Ambassador Sondland testified that this was a reference to the political investigations that President Trump discussed on the July 25 call, that Secretary Pompeo had listened to. Ambassador Sondland hoped this would ""break the logjam""-the hold on critical security assistance to Ukraine. Secretary Pompeo replied three minutes later: ""Yes."" The President's Security Assistance Hold Became Public On August 28, Politico published a story revealing President Trump's weeks-long hold on U.S. military assistance to Ukraine. Senior Ukrainian officials expressed grave concern, deeply worried about the practical impact on their efforts to fight Russian aggression, but also about the public message it sent to the Russian government, which would almost certainly seek to exploit any real or perceived crack in U.S. resolve toward Ukraine. On August 29, at the urging of National Security Advisor Bolton, Ambassador Taylor wrote a first-person cable to Secretary Pompeo. This was the only first-person cable the Ambassador had ever sent in his decades of government service. He explained the ""folly"" of withholding security assistance to Ukraine as it fought a hot war against Russia on its borders. He wrote that he ""could not and would not defend such a policy."" Ambassador Taylor stated that Secretary Pompeo may have carried the cable with him to a meeting at the White House. The same day that Ambassador Taylor sent his cable, President Trump cancelled his planned trip to Warsaw for a World War II commemoration event, where he was scheduled to meet with President Zelensky. Vice President Pence traveled in his place. Ambassador Sondland also traveled to Warsaw and, at a pre-briefing discussion with the Vice President before he met President Zelensky, Ambassador Sondland raised the issue of the hold on security assistance. He told Vice President Pence that he was concerned that the security assistance ""had become tied to the issue of investigations"" and that ""everything is being held up until these statements get made."" Vice President Pence nodded in response, apparently expressing neither surprise nor dismay at the linkage between the two. At the meeting, President Zelensky expressed concern that even an appearance of wavering support from the United States for Ukraine could embolden Russia. Vice President Pence reiterated U.S. support for Ukraine, but could not promise that the hold would be lifted. Vice President Pence said he would relay his support for lifting the hold to President Trump so a decision could be made on security assistance as soon as possible. Vice President Pence spoke with President Trump that evening, but the hold was not lifted. Following this meeting, Ambassador Sondland pulled aside President Zelensky's advisor, Mr. Yermak, to explain that the hold on security assistance was conditioned on the public announcement of the Burisma/Biden and the 2016 election interference investigations. After learning of the conversation, Ambassador Taylor texted Ambassador Sondland: ""Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?"" The two then spoke by phone. Ambassador Sondland explained that he had previously made a ""mistake"" in telling Ukrainian officials that only the White House meeting was conditioned on a public announcement of the political investigations beneficial to President Trump. He clarified that ""everything""-the White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars of security assistance to Ukraine-was now conditioned on the announcement. President Trump wanted President Zelensky in a ""public box,"" which Ambassador Taylor understood to mean that President Trump required that President Zelensky make a public announcement about the investigations and that a private commitment would not do. On September 7, President Trump and Ambassador Sondland spoke. Ambassador Sondland stated to his colleagues that the President said, ""there was no quid pro quo,"" but that President Zelensky would be required to announce the investigations in order for the hold on security assistance to be lifted, ""and he should want to do it."" Ambassador Sondland passed on a similar message directly to President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak that, ""although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear things up in public, we would be at a stalemate,"" referring to the hold on security assistance. Arrangements were made for the Ukrainian President to make a public statement during an interview on CNN. After speaking with Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Taylor texted Ambassadors Sondland and Volker: ""As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign."" Notwithstanding his long-held understanding that the White House meeting was conditioned on the public announcement of two political investigations desired by President Trump-and not broader anti-corruption concerns-Ambassador Sondland responded hours later: Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo's of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text. If you still have concerns, I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or [Secretary Pompeo] a call to discuss with them directly. Thanks. Ambassador Sondland's subsequent testimony revealed this text to be a false exculpatory-an untruthful statement that can later be used to conceal incriminating information. In his public testimony, Ambassador Sondland testified that the President's direction to withhold a presidential telephone call and a White House meeting for President Zelensky were both quid pro quos designed to pressure Ukraine to announce the investigations. He also testified that he developed a clear understanding that the military aid was also conditioned on the investigations, that it was as simple as 2+2=4. Sondland confirmed that his clear understanding was unchanged after speaking with President Trump, which he then communicated to the Ukrainians-President Zelensky had to publicly announce the two investigations if he wanted to get the meeting or the military aid. In Ambassador Sondland's testimony, he was not clear on whether he had one conversation with the President in which the subject of a quid pro quo came up, or two, or on precisely which date the conversation took place during the period of September 6 through 9. In one version of the conversation which Ambassador Sondland suggested may have taken place on September 9, he claimed that the President answered an open question about what he wanted from Ukraine with an immediate denial-""no quid pro quo."" In another, he admitted that the President told him that President Zelensky should go to a microphone and announce the investigations, and that he should want to do so-effectively confirming a quid pro quo. Both Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morrison, relying on their contemporaneous notes, testified that the call between Ambassador Sondland and President Trump occurred on September 7, which is further confirmed by Ambassador Sondland's own text message on September 8 in which he wrote that he had ""multiple convos"" with President Zelensky and President Trump. A call on September 9, which would have occurred in the middle of the night, is at odds with the weight of the evidence and not backed up by any records the White House was willing to provide Ambassador Sondland. Regardless of the date, Ambassador Sondland did not contest telling both Mr. Morrison and Ambassador Taylor of a conversation he had with the President in which the President reaffirmed Ambassador Sondland's understanding of the quid pro quo for the military aid. As Ambassador Sondland acknowledged bluntly in his conversation with Mr. Holmes, President Trump's sole interest with respect to Ukraine was the ""big stuff"" that benefited him personally, such as the investigations into former Vice President Biden, and not President Zelensky's promises of transparency and reform. The President's Scheme Unraveled By early September, President Zelensky was ready to make a public announcement of the two investigations to secure a White House meeting and the military assistance his country desperately needed. He proceeded to book an interview on CNN during which he could make such an announcement, but other events soon intervened. On September 9, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committees on Oversight and Reform, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs announced an investigation into the scheme by President Trump and his personal attorney, Mr. Giuliani ""to improperly pressure the Ukrainian government to assist the President's bid for reelection."" The Committees sent document production and preservation requests to the White House and the State Department related to the investigation. NSC staff members believed this investigation might have had ""the effect of releasing the hold"" on Ukraine military assistance because it would have been ""potentially politically challenging"" to ""justify that hold."" Later that day, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG) sent a letter to Chairman Schiff and Ranking Member Nunes notifying the Committee that a whistleblower had filed a complaint on August 12 that the ICIG had determined to be both an ""urgent concern"" and ""credible."" Nevertheless, the Acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) took the unprecedented step of withholding the complaint from the Congressional Intelligence Committees, in coordination with the White House and the Department of Justice. The White House had been aware of the whistleblower complaint for several weeks, and press reports indicate that the President was briefed on it in late August. The ICIG's notification to Congress of the complaint's existence, and the announcement of a separate investigation into the same subject matter, telegraphed to the White House that attempts to condition the security assistance on the announcement of the political investigations beneficial to President Trump-and efforts to cover up that misconduct-would not last. On September 11, in the face of growing public and Congressional scrutiny, President Trump lifted the hold on security assistance to Ukraine. As with the implementation of the hold, no clear reason was given. By the time the President ordered the release of security assistance to Ukraine, DOD was unable to spend approximately 14 percent of the funds appropriated by Congress for Fiscal Year 2019. Congress had to pass a new law to extend the funding in order to ensure the full amount could be used by Ukraine to defend itself. Even after the hold was lifted, President Zelensky still intended to sit for an interview with CNN in order to announce the investigations-indeed, he still wanted the White House meeting. At the urging of Ambassador Taylor, President Zelensky cancelled the CNN interview on September 18 or 19. The White House meeting, however, still has not occurred. The President's Chief of Staff Confirmed Aid was Conditioned on Investigations The conditioning of military aid to Ukraine on the investigations sought by the President was as clear to Ambassador Sondland as ""two plus two equals four."" In fact, the President's own Acting Chief of Staff, someone who meets with him daily, admitted that he had discussed security assistance with the President and that his decision to withhold it was directly tied to his desire to get Ukraine to conduct a political investigation. On October 17, at a press briefing in the White House, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney confirmed that President Trump withheld the essential military aid for Ukraine as leverage to pressure Ukraine to investigate the conspiracy theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. As Dr. Hill made clear in her testimony, this false narrative has been promoted by President Putin to deflect away from Russia's systemic interference in our election and to drive a wedge between the United States and a key partner. According to Mr. Mulvaney, President Trump ""[a]bsolutely"" mentioned ""corruption related to the DNC server"" in connection with the security assistance during his July 25 call. Mr. Mulvaney also stated that the server was part of ""why we held up the money."" After a reporter attempted to clarify this explicit acknowledgement of a quid pro quo, Mr. Mulvaney replied: ""We do that all the time with foreign policy."" He added, ""I have news for everybody: get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy."" Ambassador Taylor testified that in his decades of military and diplomatic service, he had never seen another example of foreign aid conditioned on the personal or political interests of the President. Rather, ""we condition assistance on issues that will improve our foreign policy, serve our foreign policy, ensure that taxpayers' money is well-spent,"" not specific investigations designed to benefit the political interests of the President of the United States. In contrast, President Trump does not appear to believe there is any such limitation on his power to use White House meetings, military aid or other official acts to procure foreign help in his reelection. When asked by a reporter on October 3 what he had hoped President Zelensky would do following their July 25 call, President Trump responded: ""Well, I would think that, if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer."" II. The President Obstructed the Impeachment Inquiry by Instructing Witnesses and Agencies to Ignore Subpoenas for Documents and Testimony An Unprecedented Effort to Obstruct an Impeachment Inquiry Donald Trump is the first President in the history of the United States to seek to completely obstruct an impeachment inquiry undertaken by the House of Representatives under Article I of the Constitution, which vests the House with the ""sole Power of Impeachment."" He has publicly and repeatedly rejected the authority of Congress to conduct oversight of his actions and has directly challenged the authority of the House to conduct an impeachment inquiry into his actions regarding Ukraine. President Trump ordered federal agencies and officials to disregard all voluntary requests for documents and defy all duly authorized subpoenas for records. He also directed all federal officials in the Executive Branch not to testify-even when compelled. No other President has flouted the Constitution and power of Congress to conduct oversight to this extent. No President has claimed for himself the right to deny the House's authority to conduct an impeachment proceeding, control the scope of a power exclusively vested in the House, and forbid any and all cooperation from the Executive Branch. Even President Richard Nixon-who obstructed Congress by refusing to turn over key evidence-accepted the authority of Congress to conduct an impeachment inquiry and permitted his aides and advisors to produce documents and testify to Congressional committees. Despite President Trump's unprecedented and categorical commands, the House gathered overwhelming evidence of his misconduct from courageous individuals who were willing to follow the law, comply with duly authorized subpoenas, and tell the truth. In response, the President engaged in a brazen effort to publicly attack and intimidate these witnesses. If left unanswered, President Trump's ongoing effort to thwart Congress' impeachment power risks doing grave harm to the institution of Congress, the balance of power between our branches of government, and the Constitutional order that the President and every Member of Congress have sworn to protect and defend. Constitutional Authority for Congressional Oversight and Impeachment The House's Constitutional and legal authority to conduct an impeachment inquiry is clear, as is the duty of the President to cooperate with the House's exercise of this authority. Article I of the U.S. Constitution gives the House of Representatives the ""sole Power of Impeachment."" The Framers intended the impeachment power to be an essential check on a President who might engage in corruption or abuse of power. Congress is empowered to conduct oversight and investigations to carry out its authorities under Article I. Because the impeachment power is a core component of the nation's Constitutional system of checks and balances, Congress' investigative authority is at its zenith during an impeachment inquiry. The Supreme Court has made clear that Congress' authority to investigate includes the authority to compel the production of information by issuing subpoenas, a power the House has delegated to its committees pursuant to its Constitutional authority to ""determine the Rules of its Proceedings."" Congress has also enacted statutes to support its power to investigate and oversee the Executive Branch. These laws impose criminal and other penalties on those who fail to comply with inquiries from Congress or block others from doing so, and they reflect the broader Constitutional requirement to cooperate with Congressional investigations. Unlike President Trump, past Presidents who were the subject of impeachment inquiries-including Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton-recognized and, to varying degrees, complied with information requests and subpoenas. President Nixon, for example, agreed to let his staff testify voluntarily in the Senate Watergate investigation, stating: ""All members of the White House Staff will appear voluntarily when requested by the committee. They will testify under oath, and they will answer fully all proper questions."" President Nixon also produced documents in response to the House's subpoenas as part of its impeachment inquiry, including more than 30 transcripts of White House recordings and notes from meetings with the President. When President Nixon withheld tape recordings and produced heavily edited and inaccurate records, the House Judiciary Committee approved an article of impeachment for obstruction. The President's Categorical Refusal to Comply Even before the House of Representatives launched its investigation regarding Ukraine, President Trump rejected the authority of Congress to investigate his actions, proclaiming, ""We're fighting all the subpoenas,"" and ""I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president."" When the Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs Committees began reviewing the President's actions as part of the House's impeachment inquiry, the President repeatedly challenged the legitimacy of the investigation in word and deed. His rhetorical attacks appeared intended not only to dispute reports of his misconduct, but to persuade the American people that the House lacks authority to investigate the President. On September 26, President Trump argued that Congress should not be ""allowed"" to impeach him under the Constitution and that there ""should be a way of stopping it-maybe legally, through the courts."" A common theme of his defiance has been his claims that Congress is acting in an unprecedented way and using unprecedented rules. However, the House has been following the same investigative rules that Republicans championed when they were in control. On October 8, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Chairmen of the investigating Committees confirming that President Trump directed his entire Administration not to cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry. Mr. Cipollone wrote: ""President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances."" Mr. Cipollone's letter advanced remarkably politicized arguments and legal theories unsupported by the Constitution, judicial precedent, and more than 200 years of history. If allowed to stand, the President's defiance, as justified by Mr. Cipollone, would represent an existential threat to the nation's Constitutional system of checks and balances, separation of powers, and rule of law. The President's Refusal to Produce Any and All Subpoenaed Documents Following President Trump's categorical order, not a single document has been produced by the White House, the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of State, the Department of Defense, or the Department of Energy in response to 71 specific, individualized requests or demands for records in their possession, custody, or control. These subpoenas remain in full force and effect. These agencies and offices also blocked many current and former officials from producing records directly to the Committees. Certain witnesses defied the President's sweeping, categorical, and baseless order and identified the substance of key documents. For example, Ambassador Gordon Sondland attached ten exhibits to his written hearing testimony reflecting reproductions of certain communications with high-level Administration officials, including Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, former National Security Advisor John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. Other witnesses identified numerous additional documents that the President and various agencies are withholding that are directly relevant to the impeachment inquiry. Like the White House, the Department of State refused to produce a single document in response to its subpoena, even though there is no legal basis for the Department's actions. In fact, on November 22, the Department was forced to produce 99 pages of emails, letters, notes, timelines, and news articles to a non-partisan, nonprofit ethics watchdog organization pursuant to a court order in a lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Although limited in scope, this production affirms that the Department is withholding responsive documents from Congress without any valid legal basis. The President's Refusal to Allow Top Aides to Testify No other President in history has issued an order categorically directing the entire Executive Branch not to testify before Congress, including in the context of an impeachment inquiry. President Trump issued just such an order. As reflected in Mr. Cipollone's letter, President Trump directed government witnesses to violate their legal obligations and defy House subpoenas-regardless of their offices or positions. President Trump even extended his order to former officials no longer employed by the federal government. This Administration-wide effort to prevent all witnesses from providing testimony was coordinated and comprehensive. At President Trump's direction, twelve current or former Administration officials refused to testify as part of the House's impeachment inquiry, ten of whom did so in defiance of duly authorized subpoenas: - Mick Mulvaney, Acting White House Chief of Staff - Robert B. Blair, Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff - Ambassador John Bolton, Former National Security Advisor - John A. Eisenberg, Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs and Legal Advisor, National Security Council - Michael Ellis, Senior Associate Counsel to the President and Deputy Legal Advisor, National Security Council - Preston Wells Griffith, Senior Director for International Energy and Environment, National Security Council - Dr. Charles M. Kupperman, Former Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, National Security Council - Russell T. Vought, Acting Director, Office of Management and Budget - Michael Duffey, Associate Director for National Security Programs, Office of Management and Budget - Brian McCormack, Associate Director for Natural Resources, Energy, and Science, Office of Management and Budget - T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, Counselor, Department of State - Secretary Rick Perry, Department of Energy These witnesses were warned that their refusal to testify ""shall constitute evidence that may be used against you in a contempt proceeding"" and ""may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President."" The President's Unsuccessful Attempts to Block Other Key Witnesses Despite President Trump's orders that no Executive Branch employees should cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry, multiple key officials complied with duly authorized subpoenas and provided critical testimony at depositions and public hearings. These officials not only served their nation honorably, but they fulfilled their oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. In addition to the President's broad orders seeking to prohibit all Executive Branch employees from testifying, many of these witnesses were personally directed by senior political appointees not to cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry. These directives frequently cited or enclosed copies of Mr. Cipollone's October 8 letter conveying the President's order not to comply. For example, the State Department, relying on President Trump's order, attempted to block Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch from testifying, but she fulfilled her legal obligations by appearing at a deposition on October 11 and a hearing on November 15. More than a dozen current and former officials followed her courageous example by testifying at depositions and public hearings over the course of the last two months. The testimony from these witnesses produced overwhelming and clear evidence of President Trump's misconduct, which is described in detail in the first section of this report. The President's Intimidation of Witnesses President Trump publicly attacked and intimidated witnesses who came forward to comply with duly authorized subpoenas and testify about his misconduct, raising grave concerns about potential violations of criminal laws intended to protect witnesses appearing before Congressional proceedings. For example, the President attacked: Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who served the United States honorably for decades as a U.S. diplomat and anti-corruption advocate in posts around the world under six different Presidents; Ambassador Bill Taylor, who graduated at the top of his class at West Point, served as an infantry commander in Vietnam, and earned a Bronze Star and an Air Medal with a V device for valor; Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, an active-duty Army officer for more than 20 years who earned a Purple Heart for wounds he sustained in an improvised explosive device attack in Iraq, as well as the Combat Infantryman Badge; and Jennifer Williams, who is Vice President Mike Pence's top advisor on Europe and Russia and has a distinguished record of public service under the Bush, Obama, and Trump Administrations. The President engaged in this effort to intimidate these public servants to prevent them from cooperating with Congress' impeachment inquiry. He issued threats, openly discussed possible retaliation, made insinuations about their character and patriotism, and subjected them to mockery and derision-when they deserved the opposite. The President's attacks were broadcast to millions of Americans-including witnesses' families, friends, and coworkers. It is a federal crime to intimidate or seek to intimidate any witness appearing before Congress. This prohibition applies to anyone who knowingly ""uses intimidation, threatens, or corruptly persuades"" another person in order to ""influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding."" Violations of this law can carry a criminal sentence of up to 20 years in prison. In addition to his relentless attacks on witnesses who testified in connection with the House's impeachment inquiry, the President also repeatedly threatened and attacked a member of the Intelligence Community who filed an anonymous whistleblower complaint raising an ""urgent concern"" that ""appeared credible"" regarding the President's conduct. The whistleblower filed the complaint confidentially with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, as authorized by the relevant whistleblower law. Federal law prohibits the Inspector General from revealing the whistleblower's identity. Federal law also protects the whistleblower from retaliation. In more than 100 public statements about the whistleblower over a period of just two months, the President publicly questioned the whistleblower's motives, disputed the accuracy of the whistleblower's account, and encouraged others to reveal the whistleblower's identity. Most chillingly, the President issued a threat against the whistleblower and those who provided information to the whistleblower regarding the President's misconduct, suggesting that they could face the death penalty for treason. The President's campaign of intimidation risks discouraging witnesses from coming forward voluntarily, complying with mandatory subpoenas for documents and testimony, and disclosing potentially incriminating evidence in this inquiry and future Congressional investigations.",['ENGLISH'],13766,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-CUVXAGAV7YI6VORYC3TJX5JMGA,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Constitutional Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Evidence', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUVGQkU0QjJFMTIzNDNBM0FCNTVEQjAxQTM3RDcwOTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Military & Veterans Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM1OUEyRDNERTdENEU2MTk3RTlCNEJCRUY0NjRGRjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N928000CC', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009TA3', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001371', 'className': 'HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST00097CZ', 'className': 'ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DLNH', 'className': 'FOREIGN AID'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ', 'className': 'The Presidency'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'N928120KM', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjU1Q0FGMTcyM0M5NDQzMkIxQ0Y0NUFFQ0VGRjQ0MjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDEwQTI5QTZCNDQ4NEM2MUI3NTM4MUYzMDgyRDQwQzE', 'className': 'Contracts Clause'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001960', 'className': 'PUBLIC POLICY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DLOJ', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0009TRZ', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST00098A0', 'className': 'FOREIGN RELATIONS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000752', 'className': 'FOREIGN POLICY'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000938', 'className': 'INTELLIGENCE SERVICES'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001996', 'className': 'NATIONAL SECURITY'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'ST00096SZ', 'className': 'PRESS CONFERENCES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX000108', 'className': 'APPROVALS'}, {'score': '53', 'classCode': 'STX000950', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'ST000D17D', 'className': 'NEWS BRIEFS'}], 'person': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'PE000DO7M', 'className': 'VOLODYMR ZELENSKY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000CTJ0', 'className': 'MIKE POMPEO'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'PE0009UP3', 'className': 'RICK PERRY'}, {'score': '54', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJK', 'className': 'JOE BIDEN'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC581', 'className': 'UKRAINE'}, {'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
2,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",POLITICS,,The five most incisive excerpts from the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment report,,,Link to Image Democrats on the House Intelligence Committeereleased their report detailing President Trump's dealings with Ukraine on Tuesday as the impeachment inquiry moves to the House Judiciary Committee.,"FULL TEXT The 300-page report outlines the evidence the committee has collected against Trump in his call with Ukraine, as well as efforts by the administration to prevent key witnesses from testifying and to withhold documents demanded by impeachment investigators. The findings could be the basis for the Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against the president. Judiciary Committee hearings begin Wednesday, and the panel could vote on articles of impeachment this month. Here are the most incisive excerpts from the report. The report accuses Trump of using his official power for personal benefit ""The President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the US presidential election process, and endangered US national security."" It pounces on Mulvaney's 'get over it' quote ""The question presented by the set of facts enumerated in this report may be as simple as that posed by the President and his chief of staff's brazenness:  is the remedy of impeachment warranted for a president who would use the power of his office to coerce foreign interference in a US election, or is that now a mere perk of the office that Americans must simply 'get over'?"" The report argues Trump's misconduct goes beyond the July 25 phone call ""In the weeks following the July 25 call, the President's hand-picked representatives increased the President's pressure campaign on Ukrainian government officials-in person, over the phone, and by text message-to secure a public announcement of the investigations beneficial to President Trump's reelection campaign."" In refusing to turn over evidence, the report says Trump 'flouted' the Constitution ""No other President has flouted the Constitution and power of Congress to conduct oversight to this extent.  No President has claimed for himself the right to deny the House's authority to conduct an impeachment proceeding, control the scope of a power exclusively vested in the House, and forbid any and all cooperation from the Executive Branch.  Even President Richard Nixon-who obstructed Congress by refusing to turn over key evidence-accepted the authority of Congress to conduct an impeachment inquiry and permitted his aides and advisors to produce documents and testify to Congressional committees."" The report suggests Trump may have intimidated witnesses in his public attacks on officials who testified ""The President engaged in this effort to intimidate these public servants to prevent them from cooperating with Congress' impeachment inquiry. He issued threats, openly discussed possible retaliation, made insinuations about their character and patriotism, and subjected them to mockery and derision-when they deserved the opposite. The President's attacks were broadcast to millions of Americans-including witnesses' families, friends, and coworkers.

3,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",METRO,,Alleged drug trafficker mentioned in connection with David Ortiz shooting case is arrested in Colombia,,,"An alleged drug trafficker whose name surfaced over the summer in connection with the shooting of Red Sox legend David Ortiz was arrested Monday in Colombia on a US warrant charging him with cocaine and heroin distribution, authorities said. The attorney general's office in Colombia announced the arrest of César Emilio Peralta, 44, also known as ""El Abusador,"" or ""The Abuser,"" in a statement Monday. Peralta was the subject of an extradition request by federal prosecutors in South Florida and Puerto Rico. He was arrested Monday morning in the Boca Grande section of Colombia, the statement.","FULL TEXT While the Florida indictment alleges Peralta and several other suspects conspired to distribute cocaine, knowing it would be imported into the US, Peralta's name was mentioned in August in connection with the Globe's reporting on the shooting of Ortiz.  The retired slugger was shot in the back at close range in June as he sat with friends in a patio  area of a popular night spot in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Ortiz survived, but details of the attack that stunned the sports world have remained shrouded in mystery. Initially, Dominican authorities said Ortiz had been targeted in a botched hit job. But investigators later changed their story, telling reporters the Dominican-born ballplayer, revered as a hero in his native country, was mistakenly shot by assailants targeting another man,  Sixto David Fernández, at the behest of Victor Hugo Gomez Vasquez. Vasquez, authorities said, had allegedly sought to kill Fernández for informing on him roughly a decade ago. The claim prompted widespread skepticism. Ortiz is 6-foot-4 and weighed about 245 pounds at the time of the June shooting. He has a dark complexion, while the light-skinned Fernández is thin and about 5-foot-6. Here's where Peralta figures into the story: Vasquez, before his June 28 arrest in connection with Ortiz's shooting, released a video denying any involvement in the attack and claiming that Fernández was closely tied to Peralta. Vasquez didn't lay blame on anyone for the shooting. Ortiz once owned an apartment in the same luxury tower in Santo Domingo as Peralta. Joe Baerlein, a spokesman for Ortiz, has said Ortiz bought his unit before the tower was built and chose to sell it about five years ago because Peralta bought the penthouse. When they crossed paths, Ortiz and Peralta acknowledged each other, Baerlein said, but Ortiz kept his distance, recognizing the danger of getting too close. ""No one in the Dominican Republic ever wanted to be an enemy of Peralta because everybody knew he was part of this [alleged] drug cartel,'' Baerlein said over the summer on behalf of his client. Baerlein declined to comment on Peralta's arrest Tuesday since he was still gathering information about it. Peralta hasn't been charged in connection with the Ortiz case, and Dominican authorities have presented no evidence linking Peralta to the shooting. Dominican National Police Colonel Frank Felix Duran Mejia told the Globe in August that investigators in the Ortiz shooting case looked into many angles, including possible links to Peralta, but found them meritless. ""Evidently, David was in, how do you Americans say, 'wrong place, wrong time,' and confused for someone else,"" Duran said in an interview at national police headquarters. ""There is no doubt. . . . But, lamentably, people want to hear something else."" A previously released FBI wanted poster said the bureau was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading directly to the arrest and conviction of Peralta. The FBI identified him by an alternative name, Cesar Emilio Peralta-Adamez. ""Cesar Emilio Peralta-Adamez is wanted for his alleged involvement in drug trafficking between 2007 and 2017 in the countries of Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Columbia, and the Continental United States, and Puerto Rico,"" the FBI said in the earlier advisory. In November 2018, the advisory said, ""a federal indictment was issued for Peralta-Adamez in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico after he was charged with Conspiracy to Import a Controlled Substance (Heroin), Conspiracy to Import a Controlled Substance (Cocaine), and Distribution for Purpose of Unlawful Importation (Cocaine)."" Peralta was at the center of an August raid by US and Dominican law enforcement on an alleged drug trafficking and money laundering ring, according to the US Treasury Department. Some 18 suspects, including former major league players Octavio Dotel and Luis Castillo, were arrested or cited in the sweep. But Peralta wasn't captured at the time.

4,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",WORLD,,Finland's prime minister resigns over postal service dispute,,,"Link to Image HELSINKI - Finland's prime minister resigned Tuesday after a key coalition partner withdrew its support from his five-party government following a strike at the country's postal service that spread to the national flag carrier Finnair. Antti Rinne, who only took office in June, has faced heavy criticism in recent days over how he and a fellow Social Democratic minister dealt with a two-week strike of the country's state-owned postal service Posti in November.","FULL TEXT Rinne, who used to be a trade union leader, and Sirpa Paatero were accused of giving inaccurate and contradictory information in the run-up to the strike, specifically over the transfer of work contracts for 700 Posti package handlers, which effectively would have led to lower pay. Paatero, a minister who was in charge of state-owned companies, resigned on Friday. Rinne had been under pressure for days over the Posti case and his role in the strike that ended on Nov. 27 after a compromise deal was reached that allowed package handlers to remain under current work contracts for now. He said it became ""obvious"" after Paatero's resignation that the Posti affair, which he described as ""a messy case with plenty issues to be cleared"" wouldn't be settled with the minister's departure. ""My biggest mistake has been that I've trusted only in the information I've been presented with,"" Rinne said, without elaborating. Rinne had accused Posti's senior management for misleading him over potential pay cuts. The strike led to a one-day sympathy strike by the Nordic country's transport sector, including Finnair, which had to cancel almost 300 flights. Rinne, who will remain in post until a successor is decided upon next week, has denied any wrongdoing. His government holds a comfortable majority of 117 seats in the 200-seat Eduskunta, Finland's parliament. His resignation prompted the formal resignation of the Cabinet that is made up of Rinne's Social Democratic Party, the Center Party, the Greens, the Left Alliance, and the Swedish People's Party of Finland. Lawmakers will decide on a new prime minister next week. Until then, the current Cabinet will continue as a caretaker government until a new one takes over as planned on Dec. 13, according to Finnish media. It's unclear whether Rinne will represent Finland at next week's European Union leaders' summit in Brussels. Finland currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU. The Social Democrats retain the power to appoint one of their own to the post of prime minister and are set to decide in the coming days on Rinne's successor. Transport minister Sanna Marin or Antti Lindtman, who leads the Social Democrats' parliamentary grouping, are widely considered to be the most likely successor to Rinne. The Center Party pulled its support from Rinne's government on Monday and urged him either to resign or to face a no-confidence vote. ""There has been lack of trust shown by the Center Party and in discussions today they detailed reasons for that,"" Rinne said in his resignation statement. ""After receiving that reply, I naturally reflected on what that meant for the government and I drew my own conclusions."" Rinne said he would continue as the chairman of the Social Democratic Party at least until next summer's party congress. ""Thanks for the short, but many moments of good cooperation,"" Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said on accepting Rinne's resignation.",['ENGLISH'],606,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-RFB3HBQWBMI6VKSIQ5Y27TNQEU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N921110CC', 'className': 'HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009EOQ', 'className': 'PRIME MINISTERS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001480', 'className': 'RESIGNATIONS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDEwNDAwQjJCNjY4NENFNzkyRjhFNzZCQ0JDNTE3MzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxRDVDOEI0NjU5NDk2QUI4QjYxMDNFREUzODcxMzk', 'className': 'Strikes & Work Stoppages'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DL5Q', 'className': 'TYPES OF GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N813930MM', 'className': 'LABOR UNIONS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001928', 'className': 'COMPANY ACTIVITIES & MANAGEMENT'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST0008X0B', 'className': 'STATE OWNED BUSINESSES'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'STX001813', 'className': 'WAGES & SALARIES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N480000CC', 'className': 'TRANSPORTATION & WAREHOUSING'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'N491000CC', 'className': 'POSTAL SERVICE'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX114', 'className': 'HELSINKI, FINLAND'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC316', 'className': 'FINLAND'}]}"
5,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,Court seems ready to curb claims over Montana Superfund site,,,Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court seemed inclined Tuesday to rule that Montana homeowners who are seeking additional cleanup of arsenic left over from years of copper smelting need the permission of the Environmental Protection Agency.,"That outcome would be a loss for the homeowners and a win for Atlantic Richfield Co. The BP-owned company is the owner of the shuttered Anaconda smelter that is at the center of a 300-square-mile Superfund site. The company says it has spent $470 million to clean the site. The justices heard arguments over the company's effort to shut down claims in state court that it should have to pay more. Homeowners who are dissatisfied with the EPA-ordered cleanup want Atlantic Richfield to pay for the removal of more arsenic-tainted soil from their properties. A high court ruling for Atlantic Richfield would not end the claims, but it would be significantly harder for the homeowners to pursue their lawsuit in Montana courts. Several justices seemed troubled by the idea that property owners whose land has been contaminated could undertake cleanup without EPA approval. Digging up a yard to put in a sand box for children could ""stir up infected dirt that could harm your neighbors many miles away,"" Chief Justice John Roberts said. Joseph Palmore, the lawyer representing homeowners in Opportunity, Montana, said the EPA has conceded it has ample authority to stop people who take measures that are inconsistent with the cleanup of a Superfund site. But Justice Elena Kagan remarked that it might be hard for the EPA to ""go around and try to figure out who's creating  sand boxes "" on Superfund sites. The EPA is supporting the company at the Supreme Court. The Montana Supreme Court ruled in 2017 that the homeowners could pursue their claims against Atlantic Richfield in state court.",['ENGLISH'],305,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-4EFPQYJM35C7RNJYD53WCNW5C4,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Environmental Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00097CH', 'className': 'ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009ZVD', 'className': 'SUPREME COURTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000830', 'className': 'HAZARDOUS WASTE'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTQ2QTA0MkM1NTUxNDNBQ0I0RjQ1NzQ1NTBGODdFRjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ', 'className': 'CERCLA & Superfund'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001598', 'className': 'SOIL CONTAMINATION'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001780', 'className': 'US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Environmental & Natural Resources'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'N922110CC', 'className': 'LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001883', 'className': 'DECISIONS & RULINGS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001928', 'className': 'COMPANY ACTIVITIES & MANAGEMENT'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DMT1', 'className': 'PATENT COURTS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001929', 'className': 'COMPANY STRUCTURES & OWNERSHIP'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDE5RjBBMzRDQjE1NDk3QjkwNDAxOTAzQ0FENUNCNTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ', 'className': 'Cleanup'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N924120CC', 'className': 'CONSERVATION'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001648', 'className': 'SUITS & CLAIMS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001940', 'className': 'ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000830', 'className': 'HAZARDOUS WASTE'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTQ2QTA0MkM1NTUxNDNBQ0I0RjQ1NzQ1NTBGODdFRjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ', 'className': 'CERCLA & Superfund'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001598', 'className': 'SOIL CONTAMINATION'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX001240', 'className': 'OIL & GAS INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'N324110CC', 'className': 'PETROLEUM REFINERIES'}, {'score': '85', 'classCode': 'ST0009FBJ', 'className': 'PETROLEUM PRODUCTS'}, {'score': '82', 'classCode': 'N447000CC', 'className': 'GAS STATIONS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001455', 'className': 'REAL ESTATE'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDE5RjBBMzRDQjE1NDk3QjkwNDAxOTAzQ0FENUNCNTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ', 'className': 'Cleanup'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N331411MM', 'className': 'COPPER SMELTING & REFINING'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N445120MM', 'className': 'CONVENIENCE STORES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000A2W7'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'ST0009T2I', 'className': 'OIL EXTRACTION'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'ST000DL4P', 'className': 'OIL & GAS FACILITIES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST0008XSL', 'className': 'RETAILERS'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000A4KL', 'className': 'ELENA KAGAN'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009UK1', 'className': 'JOHN ROBERTS'}], 'state': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GS142', 'className': 'MONTANA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
6,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,Gun background checks are on pace to break record in 2019,,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Background checks on gun purchases in the U.S. are climbing toward a record high this year, reflecting what the industry says is a rush by people to buy weapons in reaction to the Democratic presidential candidates' calls for tighter restrictions. By the end of November, more than 25.4 million background checks - generally seen as a strong indicator of gun sales - had been conducted by the FBI, putting 2019 on pace to break the record of 27.5 million set in 2016, the last full year President Barack Obama was in the White House.","On Black Friday alone, the FBI ran 202,465 checks. Some analysts question how accurately the background check figures translate into gun sales, since some states run checks on applications for concealed-carry permits, too, and some purchases involve multiple firearms. But the numbers remain the most reliable method of tracking the industry. In the years since President Donald Trump took office, the industry has struggled through what has been referred to as the Trump Slump, a falloff in sales that reflected little worry among gun owners about gun control efforts. But with the 2020 presidential election less than a year out and virtually every Democratic candidate offering proposals to restrict access to firearms, fears appear to be driving up sales again. ""The Trump Slump is real, but the politics of guns has changed a little bit over the last year,"" said Adam Winkler, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law and an expert on gun rights and politics. ""As we're coming up upon another presidential election, Donald Trump is vulnerable, and the Democratic presidential contenders are falling all over themselves to propose more aggressive gun reforms than their opponents."" Trump has been viewed as one of the most gun-friendly presidents in modern history and has boasted of strong support from the National Rifle Association. He has addressed every one of its annual conventions since the 2016 campaign, and the powerful gun lobby pumped about $30 million into efforts to elect him. Still, hopes of expanded gun rights under Trump's watch haven't materialized. Legislation that would make it easier to buy silencers stalled in Congress. In addition, Trump pushed through a ban on bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic rifles to mimic machine-gun fire. The gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas in 2017 in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history used such a device. The industry has been going through one of its toughest periods, with some gunmakers, such as Remington Arms, filing for bankruptcy. More recently, Smith & Wesson's parent company, American Outdoor Brands, announced plans to spin off its firearms unit, and Colt said it would suspend production of AR-15 rifles. Amid some high-profile mass shootings in recent years, especially the Parkland school attack in Florida that left 17 people dead, gun control advocates have gained some momentum. The crowded field of Democrats running for the White House has offered a variety of proposals to curtail gun rights. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, whose state has seen repeated mass shootings this past year, went so far as to push for a mandatory buyback program for AR- and AK-style rifles before dropping out of the race, stoking gun owners' fears when he declared during a debate, ""Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47."" The gun industry says the figures from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System reflect the Second Amendment politics of the White House race. ""Americans are choosing to invest their hard-earned dollars in their ability to exercise their rights and buy the firearms they want before gun control politicians attempt to regulate away that ability,"" said Mark Oliva, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents the gun industry. Still, some experts took issue with the figures and said it is premature to declare the Trump Slump is over. ""These numbers cannot be taken be taken at face value,"" said Jurgen Brauer, a retired business professor and now chief economist at Small Arms Analytics, which consults on the firearms industry. Brauer said the numbers are increasingly skewed by states such as Kentucky that also run background checks when they issue or renew a permit to carry a concealed firearm. In October, for example, the state ran more than 280,000 checks through the NICS system for permits. ""That number has been rising over time as increasingly states check with some frequency on their existing permits,"" Brauer said. The NICS system was created after passage of the Brady Bill, which mandated background checks to buy a firearm. Convicted felons, domestic abusers and people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution are among those who cannot legally purchase a weapon. In 1999, the first full year the system was used, just over 9 million background checks were conducted. It was near the end of Democrat Bill Clinton's second term and in the midst of a 10-year ban on assault rifles that expired in 2004. Background checks declined under President George W. Bush but picked up again in 2006 and have mostly risen since then, except for 2014 and 2017. In 2018, there were 26.18 million background checks. ""Gunmakers are promoting the idea that you should buy these guns now because they may be banned in the future,"" Winkler said. ___ This story has been corrected to delete the number of seconds per background check on Black Friday.",['ENGLISH'],920,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-OR2YMF2MHBDDDFU5AXH7C44AJM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Business & Corporate Compliance', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Public Health & Welfare Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwRTY1MDg3MTk5NDUyNkFFRDI1RjJBRERGQ0UxNzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009TA3', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DA9G', 'className': 'BACKGROUND CHECKS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000724', 'className': 'FIREARMS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001371', 'className': 'HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000820', 'className': 'GUN CONTROL'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCX', 'className': 'US DEMOCRATIC PARTY'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX000363', 'className': 'CONCEALED WEAPONS'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'ST00097CZ', 'className': 'ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX001342', 'className': 'POLITICAL CANDIDATES'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'ST0009TRZ', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ', 'className': 'The Presidency'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU2RjgyMTk2MkZDNDgwNEI0QUQzQjI3QTA0N0NFNjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEJBMUU3RjlGRDM0NDFCNUI2MzNEQjQ5OERGMjE3RDU', 'className': 'Right to Bear Arms'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'N611310QM', 'className': 'LAW SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'STX001030', 'className': 'LICENSES & PERMITS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST0009U58', 'className': 'HISTORY'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST0009JY5', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '63', 'classCode': 'N611310QM', 'className': 'LAW SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST0009JY5', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS'}], 'person': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJP', 'className': 'BARACK OBAMA'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX543', 'className': 'LOS ANGELES, CA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

But a recent decision by the United States to postpone a joint air drill with South Korea clearly hasn't satisfied Pyongyang. Ri Thae Song, vice foreign minister in charge of US affairs, accused Washington of trying to buy time by calling for a ''sustained and substantial dialogue,'' but he rejected this approach. ''The dialogue touted by the US is, in essence, nothing but a foolish trick hatched to keep the DPRK bound to dialogue and use it in favor of the political situation and election in the US,'' he said, referring to his country by its official name the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ''The DPRK has heard more than enough dialogue rhetoric raised by the US whenever it is driven into a tight corner. So, no one will lend an ear to the US any longer.'' Ri then again reminded the United States of the fast-approaching deadline, effectively repeating a veiled threat to resume long-range missile tests. ''The DPRK has done its utmost with maximum perseverance not to backtrack from the important steps it has taken on its own initiative,'' he said in a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency. ''What is left to be done now is the US option and it is entirely up to the US what Christmas gift it will select to get.'' North Korea has a history of timing launches with an eye on international developments and even US holidays. Last week, North Korea chose Thanksgiving Day to launch two projectiles from what it called a ''super large multiple-rocket launcher,'' marking the 14th test of short-range rockets or missiles it has undertaken this year. On July 4, 2017, North Korea conducted its first ICBM test, the Hwasong-14, with leader Kim Jong Un describing it as a ''gift package'' for the Americans on their Independence Day. North Korea has also dialed up the military threats in recent months, suggesting it may soon launch a ballistic missile in the direction of Japan. When Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described last week's launch as a threat to the region and the world, but described the projectiles as ballistic missiles, North Korea responded by calling him the worst idiot in the world and the most stupid man in history. ''Abe may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future and under his nose,'' KCNA said Saturday. ''Abe is none other than a perfect imbecile and a political dwarf.''",['ENGLISH'],490,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-5LZOJPQV24I6VKSIQ5Y27TNQEU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001150', 'className': 'MISSILE SYSTEMS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0009Y72', 'className': 'CHRISTMAS'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'ST0009S5Z', 'className': 'MISSILE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N928000CC', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N928120MM', 'className': 'STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST0009XS5', 'className': 'THANKSGIVING'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX000950', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'ST000DLOJ', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001150', 'className': 'MISSILE SYSTEMS'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'ST0009S5Z', 'className': 'MISSILE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX242', 'className': ""PYONGYANG, KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF""}], 'country': [{'score': '99', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC371', 'className': ""KOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF""}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC307', 'className': 'KOREA, REPUBLIC OF'}]}"

Caplan, a resident of tony Greenwich, Conn. whom The American Lawyer magazine named ""Dealmaker of the Year"" in 2018, was sentenced in federal court in Boston to serve a month in prison for paying a $75,000 bribe to pad his daughter's ACT score. He was also ordered to pay a $50,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service. On Tuesday, Judge Indira Talwani approved Caplan's motion for the return of his passport, which he surrendered in March following his arrest. ""Since my arrest, I've been consumed with why I engaged in this type of conduct,"" Caplan said in court during his sentencing hearing. ""I come to the painful realization that this whole episode was, at least in large part, my own ambition for my daughter going to college."" Caplan's one of dozens of defendants jammed up in the breathtaking scheme, in which wealthy parents cut large checks to admitted ringleader William ""Rick"" Singer to have their children falsely designated as athletic recruits at fancy schools, or to boost their kids' SAT and ACT scores. Singer's admitted to his starring role in the ruse and awaits sentencing. During Caplan's sentencing, his lawyer noted that he had refused Singer's offer to use the so-called ""side door,"" another name for the fake recruit portion of the scheme. The sprawling probe has ensnared a number of business leaders and Hollywood celebrities, including screen legends Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin. Huffman, who starred in the hit TV series ""Desperate Housewives"" and floored critics with her gutsy performance in the film ""Transamerica,"" served less than two weeks behind bars for paying a $15,000 bribe to pad her daughter's SAT score. Huffman also had to cough up a $30,000 fine, and she was ordered to perform 250 hours of community service. Loughlin and her husband, the fashion mogul Mossimo Giannulli, are facing charges for allegedly paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to get their daughters into USC as bogus crew recruits. The couple has pleaded not guilty.

9,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,Rutgers OKs deal to bring back Schiano as football coach,,,"Link to Image NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - After an on-again, off-again courtship, Greg Schiano is back as Rutgers football coach. Of course, it didn't go off without a Rutgers-like hitch. There was a glitch with microphones at a public hearing before the deal became official. The university's Board of Governors on Tuesday approved an eight-year, $32 million contract to bring back the former Scarlet Knights coach to lead the downtrodden program that has lost 21 straight Big Ten Conference games and won seven others over the last three seasons.","The 53-year-old Schiano will be introduced at a news conference on Wednesday. The agreement, which was signed by Schiano and athletic director Pat Hobbs on Saturday and announced on Sunday, will give the coach a $4 million annual salary and $7.7 million annually to hire a staff, with the amount increasing 3% annually. The incentive-laden contract runs through February 2028. The board's vote on telephone conference call took less than 15 seconds. The 20 minutes before the vote were mostly procedure measures and a chance for some to vent about problems at the university not related to football. Five people addressed the board on issues ranging from a new contract for more than 1,100 physicians associated with the university, spending money on an athletic department that annually loses money and a failure of the board to release terms of Schiano's deal before approving it. Michael Crockford, a 1998 Rutgers graduate, was the first to speak. He was cut off several times by feedback from the microphone. He objected to spending $50 million on football when it might be better spent on academics. The mic problem forced the board secretary to move the final four speakers away from the podium in the middle of the room to the board table for their two minutes of time to comment on the contract. The actual approval vote couldn't be heard because the final speaker refused to stop speaking after his limit had expired. A board member eventually asked for the memorandum to be voted on and it passed without the audience hearing the vote. The meeting was then adjourned. Schiano also would receive a $100,000 bonus if the Scarlet Knights made the conference title game and $200,000 if they won the title. Getting to a postseason bowl with a .500 record or better would yield a $75,000 bonus for a Group A bowl, $100,000 for a Group B bowl or $150,000 for a New Year's Six bowl appearance. The incentives jump to $200,000 for making the college football playoff, $250,000 for appearing in the title game and $350,000 for winning the national title. There are also incentives for winning conference coach of the year, ticket sales and academic achievement of the football team. Schiano will get a $15,000 stipend for an automobile, a country club membership and use of a private box for games. Schiano's family is authorized to fly on the team charter for games. He will be allowed to use private air transportation for recruiting if it is available. If not, he is authorized to fly first class. The deal was reached a week after talks to bring back Schiano fell apart when the two sides couldn't agree on financial commitments by the school toward improved facilities and infrastructure. An outpouring of frustration by fans and boosters and some call for Hobbs to be fired appeared to spur the resumption of talks. Schiano, a New Jersey native, went 68-67 at Rutgers from 2001-11 and turned the Scarlet Knights into consistent winners after years of being one of the worst major college football programs in the country. Success under Schiano helped Rutgers land an invitation to the Big Ten, and it joined the lucrative Power Five conference in 2014. His success came in the Big East Conference and it will be interesting to see if he can do the same thing in the Big Ten, a 14-team conference led by Ohio State, Penn State, Michigan and Wisconsin. Schiano left Rutgers in 2012 to become head coach of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but his tenure lasted only two years. He has worked at Ohio State as a coordinator in recent years, but he was never a head coach after leaving the Bucs. Schiano seemed to be in line to get the top job at Tennessee in late 2017. The deal fell apart after widespread backlash that included a protest on campus and complaints on social media from fans, state lawmakers and gubernatorial candidates over whether Schiano might have been aware of Jerry Sandusky's sexual abuse of children at Penn State when he was an assistant coach. Schiano said he had no knowledge of what was happening at the time. ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/APTop25CollegeFootballPoll and            https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and            https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",['ENGLISH'],789,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-SLXBG3XIKFFSHKNUHBL4Q6XUBA,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000365', 'className': 'CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000644', 'className': 'COACHES & TRAINERS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000CA1R', 'className': 'SCHOOL ATHLETIC STAFF'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DH0Q', 'className': 'AGREEMENTS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009ERP', 'className': 'UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX000194', 'className': 'BOARDS OF DIRECTORS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX000388', 'className': 'CONTRACTS & BIDS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001066', 'className': 'MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001429', 'className': 'PUBLIC HEARINGS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'N611310SS', 'className': 'COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'ST00096SZ', 'className': 'PRESS CONFERENCES'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'STX001813', 'className': 'WAGES & SALARIES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000CP14', 'className': 'CONFERENCE CALLS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'N611310SS', 'className': 'COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES'}], 'state': [{'score': '71', 'classCode': 'GS146', 'className': 'NEW JERSEY, USA'}]}"

11,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,DeVos calls for making financial aid unit a separate agency,,,"Link to Image Education Secretary Betsy DeVos says Congress should consider splitting her department's financial aid operation into a separate federal agency with the flexibility to operate like a private bank. DeVos made the comments Tuesday in Reno, Nevada, at an annual conference hosted by the Education Department's Federal Student Aid division, which oversees and manages nearly $1.6 trillion in federal student loans. Speaking to financial aid professionals, DeVos said the student lending division has become an ""untamed beast"" after years of tinkering by Congress, and that it needs to become a ""world-class financial firm.""","""One has to wonder: Why isn't FSA a standalone government corporation, run by a professional, expert, and apolitical board of governors?"" DeVos said during her remarks. She went on to describe an agency that would report to Congress while remaining ""truly independent from interference, political or otherwise."" She said it would ""partner"" with schools to provide student grants and loans. Any proposal to spin off lending operations would require approval from Congress. Her plan did not come with any legislation, but instead she called on members of Congress to discuss her proposal. The proposal was met with skepticism by some in Congress, including Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor. ""The Federal Student Aid office should already be putting students at the center of its work and should already be free from political whims,"" Scott said. ""The department should focus its time and resources on implementing the existing student loan programs in good faith. There's nothing that could be done with a new agency that can't be done today."" In her remarks, DeVos said a separate FSA ""would do all the things it's been charged to do - only far better."" She has long argued that the government plays an outsized role in student lending, often describing it as a ""government monopoly"" that has become costly to taxpayers and students alike. She has criticized the Obama administration for taking over federal loans that were previously provided by private banks, saying it fueled higher levels of borrowing and gave schools incentive to raise tuition rates. At the same time, DeVos says Congress has created a confusing web of programs that students struggle to navigate as they borrow loans, pay them back or pursue programs that provide debt forgiveness. ""Just look at today's parade of repayment options, forgiveness plans, unlimited lending, and complex rules,"" she said Tuesday. ""Is it any wonder students are having bad experiences?"" DeVos is proposing a radical shift in strategy at the same time that Democrats in Congress are ramping up scrutiny of her handling of multiple federal loan programs. The House's education committee has threatened to subpoena DeVos to determine why her agency has stopped processing loan forgiveness claims from students who say they were defrauded by their schools. She faces similar scrutiny amid findings that the Education Department has rejected the vast majority of applications for the federal government's Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. DeVos denies wrongdoing and blames Congress for creating programs with overly complex rules. She revived that criticism Tuesday before calling on Congress to cooperate with her proposal. ""President Trump and this administration are committed to transforming Federal Student Aid for students,"" DeVos said. ""Congress needs to come alongside us to make this happen.""",['ENGLISH'],586,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-DCPDHKZ7CJF2BHR54FWHF55YHE,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Education Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00097CG', 'className': 'EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njk4RUMyMDg4ODMwNDIwNUI1NEQwMDE0OUU3REYyOTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODhDOTBDNkNGQUQwNDUxRTk0M0ZDQ0RBRUNFNjM3ODg', 'className': 'Student Financial Aid'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009P26', 'className': 'STUDENT LOANS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009P2L', 'className': 'TUITION FEES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000365', 'className': 'CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000468', 'className': 'DEMERGERS & SPINOFFS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001938', 'className': 'EDUCATION & TRAINING'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Federal Government'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCX', 'className': 'US DEMOCRATIC PARTY'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX000194', 'className': 'BOARDS OF DIRECTORS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000DLOJ', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST0009STW', 'className': 'LEGAL MONOPOLIZATION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'N520000CC', 'className': 'BANKING & FINANCE'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009RX6'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DLCX', 'className': 'BETSY DEVOS'}, {'score': '54', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJP', 'className': 'BARACK OBAMA'}, {'score': '54', 'classCode': 'PE000A26O', 'className': 'ROBERT C SCOTT'}], 'city': [{'score': '56', 'classCode': 'ST000D1N5', 'className': 'RENO, NV, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS144', 'className': 'NEVADA, USA'}]}"
12,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,"Top Georgetown players Akinjo, LeBlanc off basketball team",,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - Two of Georgetown's top players - James Akinjo and Josh LeBlanc - will not play for the basketball team for the rest of the season. Coach Patrick Ewing announced Monday the sophomores are off the roster ""effective immediately."" The written statement did not say why they are gone from the Hoyas, who are off to a 4-3 start.","Without offering specifics on what led to either player's departure, a university spokesperson issued another statement hours later, saying: ""Georgetown takes student conduct issues very seriously and ensures that they are investigated thoroughly. While we are not able to comment on specific cases, we have processes for investigating and adjudicating alleged violations of our student code that are fair to both parties."" The nature of Akinjo's situation is still unclear, but court records reveal a restraining order was issued in November against LeBlanc and players Myron Gardner and Galen Alexander. The documents show a female Georgetown student has accused LeBlanc of ""threats against my personal safety."" Two police incident reports referenced don't mention LeBlanc or the other players by name but detail two September incidents centering on the same property in northwest Washington. In one, the plaintiff charges one of the suspects with ""showing her his erect clothed penis."" A week later on Sept 16, three male suspects entered the property and took several items, including a camera and camera lens and two PlayStation controllers, according to one report. When subsequently contacted by video call, the suspect allegedly said to the victim, ""If you tell anyone, we'll send people after you."" A third university statement Tuesday specifically notes that Akinjo's is a separate case and the ongoing legal investigation does not involve him. Akinjo, the starting point guard, and LeBlanc, a front-court reserve, are among the top five scorers this season. They were a key part of a group the third-year coach hoped would help lead the school back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since the 2014-15 season under John Thompson III. Akinjo was the 2018-19 freshman of the year in the Big East Conference, averaging 13.4 points and 5.2 assists, while making 39.1% of his 3-point attempts. He started 32 of 33 games and appeared in all of them. Ewing said before this season he considered Akinjo and another sophomore, Mac McClung, one of the best backcourts in the country. Akinjo was averaging 13.4 points and 4.4 assists this season for Georgetown, which has lost two straight games heading into a road trip - Oklahoma State on Wednesday and SMU on Saturday. LeBlanc was averaging 7.2 points and 2.7 rebounds this season. He appeared in only six games because he was suspended for the team's opener. As a freshman, LeBlanc started the last 22 games and averaged 9.1 points and 7.3 rebounds, earning a spot on the Big East all-freshman team.

13,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",ARTS,,Townshend regrets not staying to mourn after Who stampede,,,"Link to Image Link to Image NEW YORK (AP) - Forty years after a stampede left 11 people dead and 23 injured at a Who concert in Cincinnati, Pete Townshend says he's always regretted not sticking around to deal with the aftermath. Instead, the band left the Riverfront Coliseum on December 3, 1979, and moved on to Buffalo, New York, the next stop on their tour.","""I'm not forgiving us. We should have stayed,"" Townshend told The Associated Press during a recent interview where he was promoting his debut novel, ""The Age of Anxiety."" The tragedy occurred as fans surrounded the arena hoping to claim a seat near the stage. Thousands had waited hours to get inside, ready to charge in for first-come seating. The band didn't find out about the calamity until the end of the show. Townshend recalls the band's manager, Bill Curbishley, telling him: ""I've got something terrible to tell you."" Townshend then described the shock of seeing bodies sprawled on the ground as they left the stadium - ""many of whom weren't dead, by the way,"" he said. ""They didn't know who was dead and who was just badly hurt, maybe 40 bodies under blankets."" Townshend remembered the rage he felt toward Curbishley for not telling the band about the tragedy before the show, admitting that he ""wanted to kill him."" ""You could at least give (us) a choice as to whether or not to go on,"" Townshend said. ""But the choice none of us made, which was equally dim, was that we left the building. You know, we should have stayed."" Curbishley declined comment when contacted by The Associated Press. However, in an interview with WCPO of Cincinnati, he said he fought with emergency officials and insisted the concert go on so there wouldn't be more disruption, and believes it likely saved lives. ""I said, 'If you stop them, you're going to have more problems on the arena floor. You could have more people hurt for sure, and if they came back through this area, the medical teams are never going to be able to cope with what they're doing,'"" he told WCPO. ""And if keeping my band on stage saves even one life, to me, that's what it's about.'"" Lead singer Roger Daltrey visited a memorial site at a high school near Cincinnati in 2018, but the entire band has not been back. That will change: Townshend said they plan return to the for the first time: An announcement is planned for later Tuesday. Townshend says he can't help thinking about those parents who lost their children, ""It isn't all about rock 'n' roll. This is about kids from Cincinnati who died - kids from Cincinnati whose parents went through trauma; kids from Cincinnati who were disabled or hurt or damaged by what happened there,"" Townshend said. A similar tragedy occurred in 2000 at the Roskilde Music Festival in Denmark. After Pearl Jam took the stage, there was a stampede that killed nine people and injured 28. Townshend says he called the band's frontman Eddie Vedder and told him to stay there. ""Don't leave. I don't care whether you've got another festival tomorrow for a million euros. Stay there.' And they stayed there for three days. And I think it really helped,"" Townshend said. Townshend feels that enough time has passed for meaningful discussion about the Cincinnati tragedy. ""How are we responsible? ... Now, we can have a conversation about it when we go back. That conversation will pick up. We will meet people and we'll be there. We'll be there. That's what's important. I'm so glad that we've got this opportunity to go back,"" he said. ""But I do think one of the things that happened at the time was that we ran away.""",['ENGLISH'],593,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-DA4SH73TMZAZNA6NOXDQWDHQ2M,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009SE3', 'className': 'STADIUMS & ARENAS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'N711130MM', 'className': 'MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JW', 'className': 'SINGERS & MUSICIANS'}, {'score': '53', 'classCode': 'ST0009UAK', 'className': 'NOVELS & SHORT STORIES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '76', 'classCode': 'N711130MM', 'className': 'MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JW', 'className': 'SINGERS & MUSICIANS'}], 'city': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'GX619', 'className': 'BUFFALO, NY, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'GS148', 'className': 'NEW YORK, USA'}]}"

(AP) - Boeing has delayed its first test flight of its Starliner crew capsule to the International Space Station.","The launch is now targeted for Dec. 19. NASA said Tuesday that the two-day postponement was caused by problems with ground equipment at the Cape Canaveral pad. Both the Starliner and United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket are healthy, officials said. It will be the first trip to space by a Starliner. No astronauts will be aboard. Instead, a mannequin loaded with sensors and named Rosie - after World War II's Rosie the Riveter - will occupy the commander's seat. SpaceX conducted a similar test flight of its Dragon crew capsule in March. The two companies expect to start launching astronauts to the space station for NASA next year. It will be the first time since the end of NASA's space shuttle program in 2011 that U.S. astronauts rocket into orbit from home soil. NASA astronauts have been riding Russian rockets to the space station, for tens of millions of dollars per seat, while awaiting the repeatedly delayed commercial crew vehicles.

15,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,William Barr is said to doubt report backing FBI in 2016 Russia inquiry,,,"Link to Image WASHINGTON - Attorney General William Barr has told Justice Department officials that he is skeptical of a conclusion by the department's inspector general that the FBI had sufficient information to open the investigation into whether any Trump associates conspired with Russia during the 2016 presidential race, according to two people familiar with the conversations. Should Barr rebut the inspector general's assessment, due out next week in a highly anticipated report, President Trump's allies will most likely use that pushback to dismiss the work itself. The review is expected to contradict some of the unfounded theories about the 2016 election that the president and his allies have promoted.","FULL TEXT Barr's doubts are significant because they could be perceived as the nation's top law enforcement officer siding with Trump, who has long cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Russia investigation, over law enforcement officials. His views are sure to inflame critics of Barr, who have accused him of siding with the president over the rule of law in his handling of the special counsel's findings and in a recent speech in which he defended Trump's use of executive authority. While it is a part of the executive branch, the Justice Department has typically sought to maintain some independence from the White House to guarantee that justice is applied fairly and not wielded as a political cudgel. Barr's skepticism could place more pressure on John H. Durham - the federal prosecutor who is conducting a separate criminal inquiry into the roots of the Russia investigation - to find evidence backing Barr's position. Durham has already unearthed some evidence that supports Barr's uncertainty of the inspector general's findings, according to a lawyer involved in the Durham inquiry. The attorney general has also expressed skepticism at the FBI's decision to investigate Trump's own ties to Russia and whether he obstructed justice. It is unclear whether the report by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, will address that. Barr has privately praised Horowitz for his work and has not made it clear whether he will publicly disagree with the report. It is standard practice for the Justice Department to submit to the inspector general a written response to his findings, which is then included in the final assessment. Barr could use that opportunity to issue a formal rebuttal, or he could make a public statement of some other kind. ""The inspector general's investigation is a credit to the Department of Justice,"" the department's spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said in a statement Monday night. ""Rather than speculating, people should read the report for themselves next week, watch the inspector general's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and draw their own conclusions about these important matters."" A spokeswoman for Horowitz declined to comment. The Washington Post first reported the dispute. It was not clear what Barr based his uncertainty on. The threshold to open the Russia investigation was not particularly high. The FBI can open a preliminary inquiry based on ""information or an allegation"" that a crime or threat to national security may have occurred or will occur, according to bureau policy. Typically, agents open counterintelligence investigations with a small amount of evidence, Lisa Page, a former FBI lawyer who has also been a target of Trump's ire, testified privately to congressional investigators last year. The conclusion that the FBI had enough evidence when it opened the Russia investigation will be part of the long-anticipated report that wraps up Horowitz's nearly two-year inquiry into aspects of the case, including its origins and whether the FBI abused its surveillance powers when it sought a wiretap of a former Trump campaign adviser. While Horowitz is expected to sharply criticize the FBI's top leaders, he is not expected to find that any of the bureau's officials acted out of political bias against Trump when they decided to investigate links between his associates and Russia. Ultimately, Horowitz concluded that the FBI violated no rules when it began its delicate inquiry, work that not only thrust the bureau into a politically treacherous position but has also overshadowed much of Trump's presidency. Horowitz's ""excellent work has uncovered significant information that the American people will soon be able to read for themselves,"" Kupec said in her statement. As Horowitz worked on his review, senior Justice Department officials have also discussed putting in place procedures and guidelines that would force the bureau to get Justice Department approval before opening an investigation on someone like the president, one person who has been briefed on those conversations said. Horowitz also found that a low-level lawyer at the FBI, Kevin Clinesmith, altered a document to include false information, and then included it in a packet of information that the FBI used to renew a warrant to secretly wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser. That information could have been part of the reason Durham began his work as a departmental review and shifted it in recent months to a full criminal investigation. He is not expected to complete his work anytime soon. His criminal investigation spans not only the FBI, the subject of Horowitz's report, but also the CIA. Horowitz will release the more than 400-page report on Dec. 9, and he will testify before Congress about his findings on Dec. 11.",['ENGLISH'],950,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-TC2ISBAV7MI6VKSIQ5Y27TNQEU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Securities Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N922120CC', 'className': 'LAW ENFORCEMENT'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0008X5W', 'className': 'SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001932', 'className': 'CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000D4JV', 'className': 'CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX000128', 'className': 'ATTORNEYS GENERAL'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST00097CJ', 'className': 'JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N922130TM', 'className': 'PUBLIC PROSECUTORS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DJX1', 'className': 'FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DFNA', 'className': 'RULE OF LAW'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUZCQjlBMDNEMTM0NEUwM0IzREQwNkJDNEQ5OUNGMEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTBDRTRDODBEMDhCNDQyRDlGQTAzNUFFRjVEMTAwNTI', 'className': 'General Overview'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009TA3', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001371', 'className': 'HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0FGMDkyQTE0NTI1NEUyNkE0NjUxM0E2OTBDQjQ0NUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzZBMzM3QjFDOTcxNENCNzhBNTE0MzVGMzBBMzdERUY', 'className': 'Conspiracy'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}], 'industry': [{'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DNE3', 'className': 'WILLIAM BARR'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
16,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,Iconic Southern rock recording studio is revived in Georgia,,,"Link to Image Link to Image ATLANTA (AP) - The Georgia music studio that fused blues, country and other sounds into Southern rock is being reborn. Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon helped propel the Allman Brothers Band and other groups to stardom in the 1970s. Capricorn's historic Studio A is reopening this week, after years of work by Mercer University and other supporters to restore and equip it with state-of-the-art technology.","""It's a place that spawned a decade of remarkable creative activity,"" Mercer President William Underwood said in an interview. It also helped make Macon one of the nation's music capitals. Underwood hopes the renovated studio will help preserve Macon's place among cities that forged the music history of the United States - places like Nashville and Memphis in Tennessee, Muscle Shoals in Alabama and Detroit, Chicago and New Orleans. Macon's civic leaders view Southern rock through a far different lens these days than in the 1970s. Southern rockers and Southern Baptists traveled in different orbits back then. The Capricorn music scene - part of the drug-infused counterculture movement of the time - was not always welcome in conservative Middle Georgia. Now, Capricorn and Southern rock are officially sanctioned by today's leaders, many of whom were fans in their younger days. Underwood, for instance, grew up listening to Southern rock and considers The Allman Brothers Band ""the greatest jam band ever."" In planning the new music complex, Underwood and others visited music hubs including Nashville, where Elvis Presley and others recorded their hits in RCA's Studio B. ""There are people all over the world who travel to see these restored studios,"" said Larry Brumley, a senior vice president at Mercer. Macon-area officials hope the restoration - funded with help from two charitable foundations and other private donors - will help spur downtown redevelopment. The restored Macon studio is part of Mercer Music at Capricorn, a 20,000-square-foot (1,860-square-meter) complex that will include a museum. Among its goals: To train and inspire new musicians. To that end, the Capricorn Music Incubator will provide 12 rehearsal rooms for musicians to hone their craft. The idea is ""to be a place to bring talented, creative people together and have them interact and engage with one another,"" Underwood said. ""One day hopefully the next Otis Redding will come out of that incubator,"" he said. Redding's voice became emblematic of Macon music six decades ago, after Mercer University student Phil Walden discovered his vocal talents while booking local bands for fraternity parties. In 1969, Capricorn Records was formed by Walden and others, including Frank Fenton and producer Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records. ""My father loved the South, he loved Georgia and he especially loved Macon,"" Phil Walden's daughter, Amantha, said at Tuesday's dedication ceremony. ""He loved Southern music deep inside his soul."" ""My father's life mission was to show the world what the South was capable of, and today we are here to celebrate a chapter of that mission,"" she added. Walden, his brother Alan Walden and their business partners discovered new artists who went on to create what became Southern rock. The Charlie Daniels Band, the Marshall Tucker Band, Elvin Bishop, Wet Willie and others recorded songs inside the studio that was built for the Capricorn record label. The Allman Brothers Band became so popular that they helped a former Georgia governor named Jimmy Carter win the 1976 presidential election by performing at campaign events, Carter has said. Carter told Mercer graduates at their 2016 commencement that he might not have been elected if the band hadn't ""adopted"" him. ""Gregg Allman was better known than I was at that time,"" Carter said in 2017. ""The band got the campaign political attention and raised much needed funds."" When Underwood became Mercer's president, the vacant offices that once housed Capricorn were a shambles, with one exception. ""The studio itself - that magical place where this great music was made - was still intact,"" Underwood recalled. ""It was kind of a miracle."" A second venue, Studio B, will be used for larger-scale recordings and to host concerts and other special events. Film scores could be recorded there, tying into Georgia's booming movie industry, Underwood said. The studio will also feature a custom-built, 40-channel analog sound board that was created by the Maryland-based company API, he said. Wes Griffith, who now manages the newly restored studio, recalls the first time he stepped inside. ""I was in awe, standing there where all these great things happened, all this great music was made,"" Griffith said. ""It's just a dream come true for me to be the steward of that place and share that history and start a new beginning.""",['ENGLISH'],799,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-UAGWTS6SOJA4BLMBU7QOW57MVI,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009U6N', 'className': 'POP & ROCK'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009UHV', 'className': 'MUSIC'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JW', 'className': 'SINGERS & MUSICIANS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'N711130MM', 'className': 'MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000268', 'className': 'CELEBRITIES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009UGE', 'className': 'JAZZ & BLUES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DM4R', 'className': 'MUSIC HISTORY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009U58', 'className': 'HISTORY'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000300', 'className': 'CITY LIFE'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX001778', 'className': 'URBAN DEVELOPMENT'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST00099LP', 'className': 'CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX000278', 'className': 'CHARITIES'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX000297', 'className': 'CITIES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'N813211MM', 'className': 'FOUNDATIONS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009VC0', 'className': 'ARTISTS & PERFORMERS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JW', 'className': 'SINGERS & MUSICIANS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX001184', 'className': 'MUSIC INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000268', 'className': 'CELEBRITIES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'N711130MM', 'className': 'MUSIC GROUPS & ARTISTS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA2Q0M0NzJERDUwNDE0OEE2QjYzQTc0NUFFRDJFMjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Museums'}], 'city': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GX589', 'className': 'NASHVILLE, TN, USA'}, {'score': '92', 'classCode': 'ST000D21I', 'className': 'MACON, GA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX606', 'className': 'MEMPHIS, TN, USA'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GX555', 'className': 'ATLANTA, GA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'GS126', 'className': 'GEORGIA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS158', 'className': 'TENNESSEE, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS116', 'className': 'ALABAMA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
17,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,Carolina Panthers fire head coach Ron Rivera,,,"Link to Image CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - The Ron Rivera era has come to an abrupt end in Carolina. The Panthers fired their all-time winningest head coach with the team on a four-game losing streak and headed to its third non-playoff season in four years. ""I believe this is the best decision for the long-term success of our team,"" Panthers owner David Tepper said in a statement Tuesday. ""I have a great deal of respect for Ron and the contributions he has made to this franchise and to this community.""","Secondary coach Perry Fewell was been named interim head coach. Offensive coordinator Norv Turner will transition to special assistant to the head coach, and quarterbacks coach Scott Turner will serve as offensive coordinator. Tepper said he will begin a search for a new coach immediately. Rivera was hired in 2011 and was 76-63-1 in the regular season and a 3-4 postseason mark. In nine seasons Rivera guided the team to a Super Bowl appearance, an NFC championship and three NFC South titles. But the Panthers have fallen on hard times lately following injuries to quarterback Cam Newton the past two seasons. The Panthers are 5-7 this season and are all but eliminated from playoff contention after a 29-21 loss to the Washington Redskins on Sunday at home. When asked if he was worried about his future with the team on Sunday after his team surrendered a 14-0 lead to the Redskins, Rivera replied, ""I'm not worried about my future. I'm worried about this football team. We have a game coming up on Sunday"" at Atlanta. They started this season 5-3. Last year the team was 6-2 but lost seven straight games and finished 7-9. Since losing to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50 four seasons ago, the Panthers are 29-31 and have not won a playoff game. Rivera, 57, did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment from The Associated Press. Rivera's firing might not be the only change coming. Tepper, who bought the team in 2018, said long-term mediocrity is not an option for the Panthers. ""We are going to take a comprehensive and thorough review of our football operation to make sure we are structured for long-term sustained success,"" Tepper said. ""Our vision is to find the right mix of old-school discipline and toughness with modern and innovative processes. We will consider a wide range of football executives to complement our current football staff."" Tepper said the team will hire an assistant general manager and vice president of football operations. ""We all must recognize that this is the first step in a process, but we are committed to building and maintaining a championship culture for our team and our fans,"" Tepper said. Rivera was extremely well liked in the Panthers locker room, and he easily related to players having played nine seasons in the NFL for the Chicago Bears, winning a Super Bowl with Jim McMahon, Walter Payton and others in 1985. Rivera is a two-time NFL Coach of the Year and likely won't have a problem landing a job next season. As for what the move means for Newton remains to be seen given that Tepper has shown he's not afraid to make big changes. The legacies of Rivera and Newton have always been intertwined as both came to the Panthers in 2011. Newton is coming off shoulder and foot injuries and the team could save $19 million under the salary cap if they release or trade him after the season. Kyle Allen has filled in for Newton this season at quarterback and is 5-5 as a starter. ___ More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and            https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",['ENGLISH'],584,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-6P25SELKQFFHLCRBR6S4TIAKQM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000644', 'className': 'COACHES & TRAINERS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000081', 'className': 'AMERICAN FOOTBALL'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001615', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000C9YJ', 'className': 'AMERICAN FOOTBALL TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000106', 'className': 'APPOINTMENTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000126', 'className': 'ATHLETES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001618', 'className': 'SPORTS TEAM OWNERSHIP'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000A3NR', 'className': 'SOCCER TOURNAMENTS'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DH7K', 'className': 'DAVID TEPPER'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'PE000DLP9', 'className': 'CAM NEWTON'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX611', 'className': 'CHARLOTTE, NC, USA'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'GX545', 'className': 'DENVER, CO, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '72', 'classCode': 'GS149', 'className': 'NORTH CAROLINA, USA'}]}"

21,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",POLITICS,,House report to outline evidence for impeachment of President Trump,,,"Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - The House is poised to release a landmark impeachment report outlining evidence of what it calls Donald Trump's wrongdoing toward Ukraine, findings that will push Congress toward a debate over whether the 45th president should be removed from office. Democrats on the Intelligence Committee are making the case that Trump engaged in behavior violating his oath of office and, in the course of their investigation, obstructed Congress by stonewalling the proceedings. Republicans are defending the president in a rebuttal claiming Trump never intended to pressure Ukraine when he asked for a ""favor"" - investigations of Democrats and Joe Biden. They say the military aid the White House was withholding was not being used as leverage, as Democrats claim, and besides the $400 million was ultimately released, although only after a congressional outcry.","FULL TEXT Trump at the opening of a NATO leaders' meeting in London on Tuesday criticized the impeachment push as ""unpatriotic'' and ""a bad thing for our country.'' The findings being released Tuesday will lay the foundation for the House Judiciary Committee to assess potential articles of impeachment starting Wednesday, presenting a history-making test of political judgment with a case that is dividing Congress and the country. Trump said he will not watch the judiciary panel's hearing, saying it's ""all nonsense, they're just wasting their time."" Democrats once hoped to sway Republicans to consider Trump's removal, but they are now facing the prospect of an ever-hardening partisan split over the swift-moving proceedings on impeaching the president. The Intelligence Committee's is expected to vote on the report later Tuesday in a closed-door session. The findings are expected to forcefully make the Democrats' case that Trump engaged in what Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., calls impeachable ""wrongdoing and misconduct"" in pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden and Democrats while withholding military aid to the ally. For Republicans offering an early rebuttal ahead of the report's public release, the proceedings are simply a ""hoax,"" with Trump insisting he did nothing wrong and his GOP allies in line behind him. Trump tweeted his daily complaints about it all and then added a suggestive, if impractical, question: ""Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?"" Trump criticized the House for pushing forward with the proceedings while he was overseas, a breach of political decorum that traditionally leaves partisan differences at the water's edge. He predicted Republicans would actually benefit from the impeachment effort against him. For the Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi faces a critical moment of her leadership as she steers the process ahead after resisting the impeachment inquiry through the summer, warning at the time that it was too divisive for the country and required bipartisan support. Speaking to reporters at an international climate conference in Madrid, Pelosi declined to engage with impeachment questions. ""When we travel abroad, we don't talk about the president in a negative way,"" she said. ""We save that for home."" Possible grounds for impeachment are focused on whether Trump abused his office as he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to open investigations into Trump's political rivals. At the time, Trump was withholding $400 million in military aid, jeopardizing key support as Ukraine faces an aggressive Russia at its border. The report also is expected to include evidence the Democrats say suggests obstruction of Congress, based on Trump's instructions for his administration to defy subpoenas for documents and testimony. The next step comes when the Judiciary Committee gavels open its own hearing with legal experts to assess the findings and consider potential articles of impeachment ahead of a possible vote by the full House by Christmas. That would presumably send it to the Senate for a trial in January. The Democratic majority on the Intelligence Committee says its report, compiled after weeks of testimony from current and former diplomats and administration officials, will speak for itself in laying out the president's actions toward Ukraine. Republicans preempted the report's public release with their own 123-page rebuttal. In it, they claim there's no evidence Trump pressured Zelenskiy. Instead, they say Democrats just want to undo the 2016 election. Republicans dismiss witness testimony of a shadow diplomacy being run by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and they rely on the president's insistence that he was merely concerned about ""corruption"" in Ukraine - though the White House transcript of Trump's phone call with Zelenskiy never mentions the word. ""They are trying to impeach President Trump because some unelected bureaucrats chafed at an elected President's 'outside the beltway' approach to diplomacy,"" according to the report from Republican Reps. Devin Nunes of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Michael McCaul of Texas. Schiff said the GOP response was intended for an audience of one, Trump, whose actions are ""outside the law and Constitution."" Democrats could begin drafting articles of impeachment against the president in a matter of days, with voting in the Judiciary Committee next week. Republicans on the committee, led by Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, plan to use procedural moves to stall the process and portray the inquiry as unfair to the president. The White House declined an invitation to participate, with counsel Pat Cipollone denouncing the proceedings as a ""baseless and highly partisan inquiry"" in a letter to Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. Trump had previously suggested that he might be willing to offer written testimony under certain conditions, though aides suggested they did not anticipate Democrats would ever agree to them. Cipollone's letter of nonparticipation applied only to the Wednesday hearing, and he demanded more information from Democrats on how they intended to conduct further hearings before Trump would decide whether to participate. Nadler said Monday if the president really thought his call with Ukraine was ""perfect,"" as he repeatedly says, he would ""provide exculpatory information that refutes the overwhelming evidence of his abuse of power.'' House rules provide the president and his attorneys the right to cross-examine witnesses and review evidence before the committee, but little ability to bring forward witnesses of their own. ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.",['ENGLISH'],1119,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-T6Z3NOQV6MI6VORYC3TJX5JMGA,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCX', 'className': 'US DEMOCRATIC PARTY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjU1Q0FGMTcyM0M5NDQzMkIxQ0Y0NUFFQ0VGRjQ0MjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDEwQTI5QTZCNDQ4NEM2MUI3NTM4MUYzMDgyRDQwQzE', 'className': 'Contracts Clause'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009TD5', 'className': 'US REPUBLICAN PARTY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX001149', 'className': 'MISCONDUCT'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N922110CC', 'className': 'LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000DLNH', 'className': 'FOREIGN AID'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000512', 'className': 'DISMISSALS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST0009ZVD', 'className': 'SUPREME COURTS'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'PE000A0TQ', 'className': 'ADAM B SCHIFF'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJK', 'className': 'JOE BIDEN'}], 'city': [{'score': '54', 'classCode': 'GX106', 'className': 'LONDON, ENGLAND'}], 'country': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GC581', 'className': 'UKRAINE'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control officials, who regulate the state's budding cannabis industry, said they could begin taking action against inoperable dispensaries at the end of January, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. But a necessary rule is still being drafted and won't be ready by then.","FULL TEXT Officials have said licenses may not be reissued when they are up for renewal in June. Scott Hardin, an ABC spokesman, said in an e-mail last week that the amendment legalizing medical marijuana did not include an operation date for dispensaries. ""Due to this, the pace at which these dispensaries are developed and open for business is totally at the discretion of owners,"" Hardin said. ""ABC Enforcement agents continually check in with owners, requesting status updates while offering support and a reminder that the company was licensed to serve patients. ABC will send a letter to each dispensary in early January explaining the process of renewing the license while also requesting an updated time frame for opening."" Marijuana commissioners have expressed frustration at how long it is taking the 32 dispensaries in the state to open since being licensed this year. Only 11 are operating. Voters approved an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution in 2016 to legalize medical marijuana. David Couch, the attorney who drafted and sponsored the amendment, said more dispensaries should be open by now. ""It's totally unreasonable,"" Couch added. ""I think a lot of these unopened facilities are managed by out-of-state entities who believe that it's not economically in their best interest to open a facility now, so they're just going to wait. I think that's wrong."" Attorney Alex Gray, who represents several dispensaries, said cannabis companies have been weighing patient count, product supply and locations of other dispensaries. ""From the outside looking in, people don't understand a lot of the facts that go into a business,"" Gray said. ""There may be frustration that not enough dispensaries are open. Given just the timeline and what's required to be invested and the numerous business decisions that have to be made to start a multimillion-dollar industry, these are decisions that have to be made thoughtfully and deliberately.""",['ENGLISH'],419,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-7X4BY5AV7YI6VERHWNDIQQX5AM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'ST000DHHS', 'className': 'MARIJUANA'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000251', 'className': 'CANNABIS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DHI9', 'className': 'MARIJUANA REGULATION & POLICY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001102', 'className': 'MEDICAL MARIJUANA'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DHLD', 'className': 'MARIJUANA INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'ST000D8G7', 'className': 'DRUG LIBERALIZATION'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001020', 'className': 'LEGISLATION'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000108', 'className': 'APPROVALS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'Constitutional Law'}], 'industry': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'ST000DHHS', 'className': 'MARIJUANA'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DHI9', 'className': 'MARIJUANA REGULATION & POLICY'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000251', 'className': 'CANNABIS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001102', 'className': 'MEDICAL MARIJUANA'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DHLD', 'className': 'MARIJUANA INDUSTRY'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001912', 'className': 'RETAIL & WHOLESALE TRADE'}], 'city': [{'score': '58', 'classCode': 'GX541', 'className': 'LITTLE ROCK, AR, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GS119', 'className': 'ARKANSAS, USA'}]}"

She's been fired,,,"It was a few days before Thanksgiving, and the fifth-grade students were sharing what they were thankful for this year. When one of the students replied that he was grateful he was finally being adopted by his two dads, the substitute teacher interjected.","FULL TEXT ''Why on earth would you be happy about that?'' she asked, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Then, as the Utah elementary school class looked on, she launched into a 10-minute lecture about the sins of homosexuality. She refused to stop until three girls summoned the principal. The unidentified teacher has now been fired over her words, which were detailed in a video shared on social media by one of the boy's fathers, ''Dancing With the Stars'' alumnus Louis van Amstel. The staffing company that employed her said in an emailed statement that it had ''made the decision to end the employee's relationship with Kelly Services'' after conducting an investigation. The story received widespread attention. In a video uploaded to Instagram on Monday, van Amstel said he had been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support, adding, ''Josh and I and our son, we did not expect how many reactions we would get.'' An Amsterdam-born former dance coach on ''Dancing With the Stars'' who now serves as a judge in a Netherlands version of the show, van Amstel and his husband have lived in Utah for about three years, running a fitness program in Salt Lake City. They started the adoption process about a year ago, met their son, age 11, earlier this year, and expect it to be finalized later this month. Van Amstel told The Washington Post that his family had felt welcome in their community. ''Not once have I been treated like how this woman treated us,'' he said. The incident happened Nov. 21 at the public school in Cedar Hills, part of the Alpine School District. Students, responding to a question from the substitute teacher, said they were thankful for turkey, their pets, and not having to go to school during the holidays, the Tribune reported. But when the boy gave thanks for his adoptive fathers, the teacher told him it was ''nothing to be grateful for'' and lectured the class about how ''homosexuality is wrong.'' The three girls went to the principal's office after trying - unsuccessfully - to get the teacher to stop. The school acted quickly, van Amstel said. The teacher was escorted out of the school, defending her comments and blaming the boy along the way. An Alpine School District spokesman told the Tribune that the district has a strict nondiscrimination policy and that ''appropriate action'' had been taken. Van Amstel said his son initially didn't want to tell his parents what happened, fearing it might jeopardize his adoption. He had come close to being adopted previously, only for it to fall through. Instead, van Amstel said, he cried when he heard the boy's response to the teacher's question. ''We knew the moment we met him that this is our son,'' he said.",['ENGLISH'],522,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-WBYFH6AV7II6VKSIQ5Y27TNQEU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Education Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '87', 'classCode': 'ST000DFHJ', 'className': 'PHOTO & VIDEO SHARING'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001691', 'className': 'TEACHING & TEACHERS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009P2C', 'className': 'SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N611110QM', 'className': 'PRIMARY SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX000644', 'className': 'COACHES & TRAINERS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST0009RD1', 'className': 'INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000DH9S', 'className': 'EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'ST0009P2F', 'className': 'TEACHER LAYOFFS & DISMISSALS'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'STX000777', 'className': 'GAYS & LESBIANS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST000D0VJ', 'className': 'SOCIAL MEDIA'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST000DE1R', 'className': 'PHYSICAL FITNESS'}, {'score': '61', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST000CNT2', 'className': 'RUNNING'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX000671', 'className': 'EXERCISE & FITNESS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX000023', 'className': 'ADOPTION'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'ST0009XS5', 'className': 'THANKSGIVING'}], 'industry': [{'score': '87', 'classCode': 'ST000DFHJ', 'className': 'PHOTO & VIDEO SHARING'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N611110QM', 'className': 'PRIMARY SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST0009RD1', 'className': 'INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000DH9S', 'className': 'EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST000D0VJ', 'className': 'SOCIAL MEDIA'}], 'city': [{'score': '74', 'classCode': 'GX593', 'className': 'SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA'}, {'score': '53', 'classCode': 'GX230', 'className': 'AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS'}], 'state': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GS160', 'className': 'UTAH, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GC322', 'className': 'NETHERLANDS'}]}"
26,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,Domingo's accusers slam claims he never acted badly to women,,,Link to Image Link to Image SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Two opera singers who accused Placido Domingo of sexual misconduct said Tuesday that it was disappointing and disturbing that the opera legend recently claimed he has always behaved like a gentleman and never acted improperly toward women. Angela Turner Wilson and Patricia Wulf were among more than 20 women who accused Domingo of sexual harassment or inappropriate sexually charged behavior in two Associated Press reports this summer.,"Their new statement came in response to comments Domingo made in two recent interviews with European publications, in which he disputed the allegations against him and said he never abused his power. He said he always behaved like a gentleman but that ""gallant gestures are viewed differently nowadays."" ""There is nothing 'chivalrous' or 'gallant' about groping a woman in the workplace, in any country or era,"" Wilson and Wulf said in the statement issued through their attorney, Debra Katz. The Grammy Award-winning singer is one of the most celebrated and powerful men in the opera world and regarded as one of the greatest opera singers of all time. The long-married, Spanish-born star also is a prolific conductor and longtime administrator, having served as the general director of both the Los Angeles Opera and Washington Opera. Until recently, the 78-year-old had not spoken publicly about the allegations and had limited his reaction to statements from his lawyer and publicist. He had called the accusations ""in many ways, simply incorrect."" Last week, Domingo gave an interview to Spanish online newspaper El Confidencial in which he again stopped short of flatly denying the women's allegations but insisted he had never behaved improperly. He added that Spaniards are by nature ""warm, affectionate and loving. ""I have been gallant but always within the limits of gentlemanliness, respect and sensitivity,"" he said. Domingo also spoke to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, denying he abused his power and saying casting decisions were not made by him but by ""a team of four or five people."" He said that ""very offensive things were said about me as a human being."" Domingo's statements and ""continued failure to take responsibility for wrongdoing or to express any remorse is extremely disappointing and deeply disturbing,"" Turner and Wulf's statement said. ""He did not behave like a gentleman when he repeatedly propositioned women for sex in the workplace ... and when he groped them and kissed them over their objections,"" the statement said. ""He did not behave respectfully when he offered to assist with the careers of aspiring female opera singers if they came to his apartment and had sex with him."" The most serious allegation lodged against Domingo came from Turner, a soprano, who told the AP that he forcefully grabbed her breast in a makeup room at the Washington Opera in 1999 after she rejected his advances for weeks. Wulf, a mezzo soprano, said Domingo persistently propositioned and harassed her during performances at the Washington Opera in 1998, when he was general director. Another singer said when she worked with Domingo at the Los Angeles Opera in the mid-2000s, he stuck his hand down her skirt after asking her to sing for him at his apartment. Others said he forced wet kisses on their lips. U.S. opera houses canceled Domingo's upcoming performances following the accusations, and he resigned from the LA Opera, where he had been general director since 2003. It's investigating the allegations. European theaters have supported Domingo and maintained his appearances. ""It is deeply upsetting and unfair that Mr. Domingo can retreat to another world without having to come to terms with what he has done to many, many women here,"" Wulf said. The women's statement said Domingo's comments show an attempt to absolve his misconduct by blaming cultural differences and changing rules and standards.",['ENGLISH'],651,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-ORIZVJHVJZDY7ABHUTGO2EXSSY,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JW', 'className': 'SINGERS & MUSICIANS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001254', 'className': 'OPERA'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZF6', 'className': 'INTERVIEWS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX001149', 'className': 'MISCONDUCT'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000268', 'className': 'CELEBRITIES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DI17', 'className': 'GRAMMY AWARDS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001556', 'className': 'SEXUAL HARASSMENT'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001851', 'className': 'WOMEN'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009IR9', 'className': 'ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS AWARDS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFENzYyRUI3RjFENEUwOEIyN0U0NEZBQjE5RjExMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc', 'className': 'Sexual Assault'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST0009UHV', 'className': 'MUSIC'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JW', 'className': 'SINGERS & MUSICIANS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000268', 'className': 'CELEBRITIES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009IR9', 'className': 'ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS AWARDS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DI17', 'className': 'GRAMMY AWARDS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}], 'city': [{'score': '78', 'classCode': 'GX543', 'className': 'LOS ANGELES, CA, USA'}]}"
27,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,Trump against the world: A snapshot of his trade disputes,,,"Link to Image Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - There are lots of ways, it seems, to land on one of President Donald Trump's tariff hit lists. Countries can allegedly steal U.S. trade secrets. Or they can introduce a tax that the Trump administration doesn't like. Or they can be unlucky enough to find themselves in such dire economic straits that their currencies go into a freefall. Making good on his campaign pledge to upend decades of U.S. policy in favor of a pugnacious America-first approach, Trump has launched a series of protectionist broadsides against America's trading partners. He's also strived to replace a 25-year-old North American trade agreement with an updated version more to his liking. So far, though, he's been stymied by the U.S. Congress. Here's a look at some of the major items on Trump's trade agenda:","___ A TRADE WAR WITH CHINA For the past 17 months, the world's top two economies have been locked in the biggest global trade war since the 1930s. The Trump administration accuses Beijing of cheating in its quest to become the world's supreme leader in such cutting-edge industries as robotics and driverless cars. The administration, backed by many U.S. business groups, alleges that China steals technology, forces U.S. companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to its vast market and unfairly subsidizes China's tech companies while hogtying their foreign competitors in red tape. Trump has also railed against America's gaping trade deficit with China: $380 billion last year. The president has imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports and plans to tax an additional $160 billion in goods on Dec. 15 - a move that would extend his import taxes to just about everything China ships to the United States. Beijing has hit $120 billion in U.S. products with retaliatory tariffs. Thirteen rounds of negotiations have failed to achieve even a preliminary breakthrough. Beijing is reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that might satisfy the administration. In October, the two sides agreed to a modest deal that left the thorniest issues unresolved: Trump agreed not to proceed with plans to raise tariffs on some Chinese goods. Beijing agreed to buy large quantities of U.S. farm exports. But they have failed to finalize that so-called Phase 1 agreement. And on Tuesday, Trump warned that an agreement might not be reached until after the 2020 presidential election. ___ METALS MAYHEM Last year, Trump unsheathed a little-used weapon in U.S. trade policy - Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 - to declare foreign steel and aluminum a threat to America's national security. Using that justification, he imposed tariffs of 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% on aluminum. But he exempted several countries. Argentina and Brazil, for instance, avoided the tariffs by agreeing instead to accept quotas on their metal exports to the U.S. With one early-morning tweet Monday, Trump demolished that arrangement. He accused Argentina and Brazil of manipulating their currencies lower in order to give their exporters an unfair price advantage in foreign markets. It's true that Brazil's real and the Argentina's peso have plummeted against the U.S. dollar. But it's not because their governments have engaged in currency manipulation. Rather, it's because their economies are in crisis: Brazil is contending with double-digit unemployment and economic stagnation after two years of deep recession. Argentina is suffering from an economic crisis marked by runaway inflation, huge debts and widespread poverty. ___ NAFTA 2.0 Trump last year browbeat Mexico and Canada into agreeing to a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But his version - the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA - still awaits approval from the U.S. Congress. Having taken effect in 1994, the original NAFTA erased most trade barriers between the three economies and created a powerful regional trade bloc. Many U.S. manufacturers moved factories south of the border to capitalize on low-wage Mexican labor and ship products back to the United States, duty-free. Trump and other critics accused NAFTA of wiping out American manufacturing jobs. Trump warned that if he couldn't negotiate a better deal, he'd kill NAFTA altogether. USMCA emerged after more than a year of contentious negotiations. The revamped deal is meant to return some factories and factory jobs to the United States. Among other things, it requires that 40% to 45% of autos must be built where auto workers earn at least $16 an hour in order to qualify for the trade deal's duty-free status. But House Democrats, who must approve USMCA, insist that Trump's version needs to be tweaked to ensure that it can be enforced. They've been negotiating changes with Trump's top trade official, Robert Lighthizer, but have yet to resolve their differences. ___ FRANCE'S TECH TAX The administration on Monday announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 100% on cheese, wine, lipstick and other French imports, collectively worth $2.4 billion. The reason: France last summer passed a digital services tax that targets American tech giants such as Amazon and Google. The French tax is designed to prevent tech companies from dodging taxes by establishing their headquarters in low-tax European Union countries. It imposes a 3% annual levy on French revenue of digital companies with yearly global sales worth more than 750 million euros ($830 million) and French revenue exceeding 25 million euros. The Trump administration has also criticized the French tax for targeting companies' revenue, not their profits, and for being retroactive. French President Emmanuel Macron has threatened a robust ""response'' from Europe if the U.S. proceeds with the tariffs. ___ TAXING FOREIGN CARS At Trump's request, the Commerce Department launched an investigation into auto imports - and then dutifully declared that they, too, posed a threat to America's national security. That could clear the way for Trump to impose tariffs on foreign vehicles and auto parts. Auto tariffs would mark a major escalation in Trump's protectionist policies. The United States last year imported $192 billion worth of passenger vehicles and $159 billion in auto parts. Virtually no one outside the White House supports the tariffs. Imposing them would widen a rift with Europe and risk a backlash in Congress, where lawmakers are already considering scaling back the president's power to impose tariffs on national security grounds. Trump has sought to use the tariff threat to wring trade concessions out of Japan and the European Union. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said that Trump vowed to forgo tariffs on Japan's cars as part of a mini-trade deal the two countries reached earlier this year. In May, Trump delayed the tariffs for six months while continuing negotiations with Japan and the EU. As mid-November approached, Trump said he'd decide on the tariffs ""very soon.'' But the deadline came and went with no comment from the administration. ___ Follow Paul Wiseman on Twitter at @PaulWisemanAP",['ENGLISH'],1179,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-J7YJAR6YNJA6ZGF46PDGSCKFUQ,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'International Trade Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Trade Secrets Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkE5RkIzRDg2MDIzNDY1Mjg0OURCRDlFNTQ3NkE0NDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Transportation Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001688', 'className': 'TAXES & TAXATION'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001673', 'className': 'TARIFFS & DUTIES'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX000895', 'className': 'IMPORT TRADE'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'International Trade Law'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000DH0Q', 'className': 'AGREEMENTS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST00629441', 'className': 'INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CRIME'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX000951', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL TRADE'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009890', 'className': 'PROTECTIONISM'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001960', 'className': 'PUBLIC POLICY'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001742', 'className': 'TRADE DISPUTES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Federal Government'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001937', 'className': 'ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk', 'className': 'Trade Agreements'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkE5RkIzRDg2MDIzNDY1Mjg0OURCRDlFNTQ3NkE0NDA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI', 'className': 'Trade Secrets'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000DA1D', 'className': 'US CONGRESS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX001740', 'className': 'GOODS & SERVICES TRADE BALANCE'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX000797', 'className': 'GLOBALIZATION'}, {'score': '64', 'classCode': 'STX001758', 'className': 'TREATIES & AGREEMENTS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST000DI5Y', 'className': 'AUTONOMOUS MOTOR VEHICLES'}], 'person': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}], 'city': [{'score': '86', 'classCode': 'GX071', 'className': 'BEIJING, CHINA'}], 'state': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GR203', 'className': 'NORTH CENTRAL CHINA'}], 'country': [{'score': '96', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '95', 'classCode': 'GC302', 'className': 'CHINA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GR120', 'className': 'NORTH AMERICA'}]}"
28,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,School reforms fail to lift US on global test,,,"The performance of American teenagers in reading and math has been stagnant since 2000, according to the latest results of a rigorous international exam, despite a decadeslong effort to raise standards and help students compete with peers across the globe. And the achievement gap in reading between high and low performers is widening. Although the top quarter of American students have improved their performance on the exam since 2012, the bottom 10th percentile lost ground, according to an analysis by the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal agency.","FULL TEXT The disappointing results from the exam, the Program for International Student Assessment, were announced Tuesday and follow those from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, an American test that recently showed that two-thirds of children were not proficient readers. Overall, American 15-year-olds who took the PISA test scored slightly above students from peer nations in reading but below the middle of the pack in math. The top performers in reading were four provinces of China - Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Also outperforming the United States were Singapore, Macao, Hong Kong, Estonia, Canada, Finland, and Ireland. The United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia performed similarly to the United States. Among the countries that demonstrated improvement on the test were Portugal, Peru, and Colombia. There were some bright spots for the United States: Achievement gaps between native-born and immigrant students were smaller than such gaps in peer nations. Low-performing students have been the focus of decades of bipartisan education overhaul efforts, costing many billions of dollars, that have resulted in a string of national programs - No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, the Common Core State Standards, the Every Student Succeeds Act - but uneven results. There is no consensus on why the performance of struggling students is declining. Education experts argue vociferously about a range of potential causes, including school segregation, limited school choice, funding inequities, family poverty, too much focus on test prep, and a dearth of instruction in basic skills like phonics. About a fifth of American 15-year-olds scored so low on the PISA test that it appeared they had not mastered reading skills expected of a 10-year-old, according to Andreas Schleicher, director of education and skills at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which administers the exam. Those students, he said, face ""pretty grim prospects"" on the job market. Daniel Koretz, an expert on testing and a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said recent test results showed that ""it's really time to rethink the entire drift of policy reform because it just isn't working."" Because the United States lacks a centralized system for teacher training or distributing quality instructional materials to schools, Koretz said, states and districts did not always effectively carry out the Common Core or other initiatives. The Common Core, which began almost a decade ago, has been a national effort by governors, state education chiefs, philanthropists, and school reformers to enrich the American curriculum and help students compete with children around the world. Its priorities include increasing the amount of nonfiction reading, writing persuasive essays using evidence drawn from texts, and adding conceptual depth in math. The effort became a political lightning rod, with the left opposing a new generation of standardized tests tied to the Core, and the right seeing the effort as an unwelcome intrusion into local control of schools. Some states that initially signed on to the Core later rejected it. Even in those places that stuck with the effort, the curricular changes that flowed from the Common Core could be made without necessarily improving the quality of teaching, Koretz said. He suggested a renewed focus on classroom instruction, and on providing students and families who are poor, or are recent immigrants, with support like social workers and translators. The most recent PISA test was given in 2018 to 600,000 15-year-olds in 79 education systems around the world, and included both public and private school students. In the United States, a demographically representative sample of 4,800 students from 215 schools took the test, which is given every three years. Although math and science were also tested, about half of the questions were devoted to reading, the focus of the 2018 exam. Students were asked to determine when written evidence supported a particular claim and to distinguish between fact and opinion, among other tasks.",['ENGLISH'],815,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-FFNPDGAV7II6VKSIQ5Y27TNQEU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Education Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkExMjY0RTgyMzAxNDZFNkE3MERFRTBGRUFDNDFFNkU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRGMkI4ODIzRjgxNEE2RkE2OEE5MTU0MDdFM0Y5RjI', 'className': 'Standard Achievement Tests'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009ER8', 'className': 'ACADEMIC STANDARDS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST00097CG', 'className': 'EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0009ERK', 'className': 'SCHOOL PERFORMANCE'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000006', 'className': 'ACADEMIC TESTING'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001434', 'className': 'PUBLIC SCHOOLS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEM2MTQ4MDU4RjZCNDM1QzhGNkQxOUM1RUU5NTUyN0E7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjM5NEJCMDNFQkQ0NEM4NkEwOTQwOTkyRDRCRjZDNzA', 'className': 'Desegregation'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009P2P', 'className': 'US NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX000290', 'className': 'CHILDREN'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Federal Government'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000022', 'className': 'ADOLESCENTS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001477', 'className': 'RESEARCH REPORTS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX000887', 'className': 'IMMIGRATION'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST00096UX', 'className': 'POOR POPULATION'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX001627', 'className': 'STATISTICS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST0009P04', 'className': 'SCHOOL CHOICE'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000CA2H', 'className': 'POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001434', 'className': 'PUBLIC SCHOOLS'}], 'city': [{'score': '68', 'classCode': 'GX071', 'className': 'BEIJING, CHINA'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'GX072', 'className': 'SHANGHAI, CHINA'}], 'state': [{'score': '86', 'classCode': 'GR202', 'className': 'EAST CHINA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS036', 'className': 'JIANGSU, CHINA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS049', 'className': 'ZHEJIANG, CHINA'}, {'score': '53', 'classCode': 'GR203', 'className': 'NORTH CENTRAL CHINA'}], 'country': [{'score': '97', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC339', 'className': 'CANADA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC303', 'className': 'HONG KONG'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC591', 'className': 'MACAO'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GC329', 'className': 'UNITED KINGDOM'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'GC306', 'className': 'JAPAN'}, {'score': '53', 'classCode': 'GC302', 'className': 'CHINA'}, {'score': '53', 'classCode': 'GC571', 'className': 'ESTONIA'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'GC353', 'className': 'PERU'}]}"
29,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",CELTICS,,Gordon Hayward making progress but can't project a return date,,,"Forward Gordon Hayward completed some contact drills against Celtics coaches Tuesday as he continues to move closer to his return after suffering a broken left hand last month. ""It's definitely sore, and I think that's something I've got to work through,"" Hayward said. ""I've got to work through that to make my hand stronger, and hopefully over the next couple of days I can do that and get it kind of more the same strength of my right hand. ""I think it's going to be a little while, and plus I was right-hand-dominant anyway. So it's definitely going to probably not be the exact same, but get it more strengthened so the percentage is closer to my right.""","FULL TEXT Hayward suffered the injury when he collided with Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge in the Celtics' Nov. 9 win over San Antonio. He underwent surgery two days later and was initially ruled out for six weeks. Hayward said last weekend that he believed he was progressing ahead of schedule, but on Tuesday he acknowledged that he was uncertain about when he might return. He is eager to test the hand in less-scripted practice situations and anticipates dealing with some pain for most of this year. ""It's definitely something where, hopefully not the rest of the season, but certainly a lengthy part of the season, I'm going to have to continue to get treatment, continue to ice it and kind of manage some of the symptoms,"" Hayward said. ""I don't want it to get hit again, but I'm sure it will get hit again, and when that happens, it'll be sore. So I'll manage that."" Hayward said he will look into wearing some kind of pad or wrap on the hand when he comes back, but he generally prefers not to because it can affect his play. He is grateful that he has been able to maintain his conditioning, however. ""It's been great,"" he said. ""This injury is nothing compared to the last one. Any time you just injure something in your upper body, at least you can be doing legs and moving around. Jumping, that's huge, in my opinion."" Garnett on Irving Former Celtics star Kevin Garnett said Tuesday that he is not surprised that Kyrie Irving left Boston to sign with the Nets, because he doesn't have the mental makeup needed to thrive in the city. ""Boston's a tough town, dog,"" Garnett told reporters in New York while promoting ""Uncut Gems,"" his new film starring Adam Sandler. ""You got to want that. The people want it for you. That's why Paul [Pierce] is perfect for it. Paul wants the shot every time. Like, 'You're 0 for 14.' And he's like, 'I know, but they want it.' "" In October 2018, Irving told a large group of Celtics season ticket-holders that he intended to re-sign with Boston at season's end. But then the season went sour, and just over one month after the Celtics were defeated by the Bucks in five games in the conference semifinals, Irving agreed to a four-year deal with the Nets. He missed Brooklyn's two games against the Celtics last week because he is sidelined with a shoulder injury, but when the Nets came to Boston last Wednesday, the night was filled with anti-Irving chants anyway. Smart is hurting Guard Marcus Smart missed Tuesday's practice because of an illness and a sore oblique, and  coach Brad Stevens said he will be listed as doubtful for Wednesday's game against the Heat. Smart injured his oblique when he tried to take a charge on Knicks forward Kevin Knox during the win over New York Sunday. He was helped off the court and did not return. A left oblique injury forced Smart to miss the first round of last year's playoffs, too. He has been dealing with plenty of bumps and bruises this year. Stevens was asked whether the team might consider sitting him out for a stretch to regroup. ""We're open to that with any of the guys,"" Stevens said. ""We've talked to them about it. And if our training staff thinks there's something that is really nagging a guy, then they will certainly suggest it. ""This is a decision that will be based on if he can get over being sick, which he was pretty under the weather today. And then the oblique, which is obviously, with his past, we're just alert to. ""Sounds like it's just like a contusion, so that's good, but that doesn't mean it's not super sore. And if it's super sore, he's not going to play."" Langford update Stevens said that rookie Romeo Langford's most recent ankle injury, suffered in the Maine Red Claws' win Sunday, does not appear to be as serious as initially feared. Langford has remained in Maine and will continue to practice there instead of returning to Boston to begin another round of rehabilitation.

30,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,"Chicago police blame Facebook for illegal gun, drug sales",,,"Link to Image CHICAGO (AP) - Private Facebook groups have ""emboldened"" sellers of illegal drugs and guns to connect with potential buyers over the social media site, Chicago police said Tuesday, as leaders announced that a two-year undercover investigation led to more than 50 arrests. Police leaders, including Chicago's new interim superintendent, also accused Facebook of failing to help prevent illegal sales of guns. The social media company banned private sales, trades and exchanges of firearms in 2016, but investigators said they found dealers using private groups and messages to quickly sell firearms and drugs at prices higher than street values.","First Deputy Superintendent Anthony Riccio said Facebook agreed to shut down groups identified during the Chicago investigation but that it also should kick members of those groups off the site. ""Facebook often cites privacy concerns when they are confronted with the facts of our investigation,"" Riccio said. ""The truth is, Facebook is harboring criminals. These criminals know how to use the privacy Facebook affords them and they profit from the sales of illegal drugs and dangerous guns."" Riccio also said police have been frustrated by Facebook's removal of fake profiles that investigators use to pose as potential buyers. Facebook spokeswoman Sarah Pollack said the company quickly responds to ""valid legal"" requests from police. ""Illicit drug and firearms sales have no place on our platform,"" Pollack said. ""We remove content and accounts that violate our policy and catch over 97% of drug sale content and over 93% of the firearms sales content we remove before it is reported to us."" The company's instructions for law enforcement say a subpoena is required to share a subscriber's records including name, email addresses and location information on recent log-ins; disclosing contents of an account requires a federal or state search warrant. The site also says all Facebook users must use ""the name they go by in everyday life,"" and fake accounts will be penalized. Facebook says it uses detection technology to find content that violates its policies banning the sale of drugs or firearms, including posts in private groups. Chicago police leaders have blasted Facebook after previous investigations of illegal guns and drug sales on the site. In 2017, then-Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the company was failing to cooperate with police cracking down on the activity. Tension over law enforcement's use of social media networks exists in other areas too; for example, police in Memphis were sued by the state's branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in 2018 for using an undercover Facebook account to monitor protest groups' activities. Personal privacy advocates say Facebook could do more to protect users from that type of police activity and keep meeting its baseline responsibility to hold law enforcement to the same rules as everyone else on the platform. ""Police shouldn't get to follow different rules than members of the public,"" said Dave Maass, a researcher for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""They may say 'Oh, this is to cut down on gun sales.' The next thing you know, you're searching social media for information on First Amendment activities or whether they've been driving while texting."" Charlie Beck, Chicago's interim police superintendent and the former head of the Los Angeles Police Department, said Tuesday that Facebook users' privacy rights don't ""trump the rights of the general public."" ""Another person's rights have to stop where the safety of another individual becomes in jeopardy,"" Beck said. ""That's what laws are all about.""",['ENGLISH'],605,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-UC7OD2U3OBATNLMQ4VXJZTENYM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Computer & Internet Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009RD1', 'className': 'INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000885', 'className': 'ILLEGAL WEAPONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001932', 'className': 'CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000C4EM', 'className': 'DRUG PRICES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000724', 'className': 'FIREARMS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001640', 'className': 'SUBPOENAS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX000535', 'className': 'CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX000820', 'className': 'GUN CONTROL'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DAPW', 'className': 'ILLEGAL DRUGS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001970', 'className': 'TRENDS & EVENTS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N922120CC', 'className': 'LAW ENFORCEMENT'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODVCRjhDNURBRDYzNDAzNjlFMDA3ODgyMUQ0ODhDRjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzkzMEJFRkNCRUQwNEIyOEE3QTBDOEFFM0ZDRDg0NzU', 'className': 'Arrests'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000D0VJ', 'className': 'SOCIAL MEDIA'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTYxNERFOEFFQUJFNEJENzk2RUVGOUQ0NkY3MTczNEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjREMTg2REVCODAxNERBRTkwNzJFQzNCM0ZENTUyMDc', 'className': 'Search Warrants'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DIJW', 'className': 'PRICES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000DM8S', 'className': 'FALSE IDENTITY'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE', 'className': 'Privacy Rights'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DL3J', 'className': 'INTERIM MANAGEMENT'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009RD1', 'className': 'INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000C4EM', 'className': 'DRUG PRICES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'N510000CC', 'className': 'MEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000D7DY', 'className': 'INFORMATION SECURITY & PRIVACY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000D0VJ', 'className': 'SOCIAL MEDIA'}]}"

(AP) - A dog who was dubbed the unicorn puppy because of a tail-like growth between his eyes will remain with the founder of a Missouri rescue group, despite more than 300 offers to adopt him.","FULL TEXT The beagle-mix puppy, named Narwhal the Little Magical Furry Unicorn, was rescued in November by Mac's Mission in southeast Missouri. He drew international attention when his picture hit social media, prompting all the adoption offers but also some negative attention, including death threats, said Rochelle Steffen, founder of the Mac's Mission in Jackson. Those two factors - plus the dog's winning personality - convinced Steffen to reverse an earlier decision to find a new home for Narwhal, she told The Southeast Missourian. She said her tiny rescue could not properly vet the 300 adoption applicants and she was concerned by ""stupid, ugly comments (online) about this sweet little puppy."" People have shown up at the rescue in Jackson because of the dog, prompting security measures and meetings ""by appointment only,"" Steffen said. Narwhal is watched at all times by Steffen and trusted volunteers. Steffen said she wanted to keep the dog safe and was concerned he could be exploited by someone without his best interests at heart. ""If somebody is going to make money off of him, I would love to see it go toward the rescue, and save thousands more dogs,"" Steffen said. People have made ""giant"" offers to buy him, Steffen said. ""But he's not for sale."" And the dog's cute personality made it difficult to consider giving him to someone else, she said. ""It's not just a decision from me,"" she said. ""The whole rescue cannot fathom him leaving. We all fell in love with him."" Mac's Mission is currently involved in a court case involving the sale of a previously adopted dog, which taught Steffen that the organization loses control over an animal's fate once it is adopted. And the mission's former treasurer, Elizabeth Hann, is awaiting trial on charges that she stole $120,000 from the organization, which specializes in caring for animals with special needs. ""We have had a rough couple of years here,"" Steffen said of Mac's Mission. ""Lots of loss, lots of hurt."" And Mac, the mission's current ""spokesdog"", turns 9 in January.

32,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",WORLD,,Trump resists wading into British politics - except to say Boris Johnson 'will do a good job' if elected,,,"Link to Image LONDON - President Trump, viewed by many here as an American bull in the proverbial china shop, was especially diplomatic on Tuesday, as he promised to ''stay out'' of British politics, just 10 days before a general election. But he couldn't quite help himself.","FULL TEXT Trump declared that his ally Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ''very capable and I think he'll do a good job'' if elected on Dec. 12. As for Johnson's opponent, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, the president on Tuesday said, ''I can work with anybody.'' A month ago, in a call-in to Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage's radio show, Trump warned Britain that Corbyn would be ''so bad for your country, so bad.'' Trump claimed, ''He'd take you in such a bad way.'' Sitting next to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders Tuesday morning, Trump turned a photo-op into a 50-minute impromptu news conference. Mostly, Trump spoke about NATO and his feelings about French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump slammed as ''very, very nasty'' and ''very disrespectful'' recent comments by his French counterpart about the diminished state of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance. In his side remarks Tuesday, Trump was asked if he thought that Britain's government-run National Health Service should be on the table in future US-UK trade deals. ''No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly,'' Trump said. ''I don't even know where that rumor started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn't want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.'' The rumor may have started with Trump and his ambassador to Britain, Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets. The ambassador told the BBC on June 2 that all areas of the British economy, including the NHS and food, would be ''on the table'' in any future trade talks. Trump echoed the point two days later. During a news conference in London on June 4, when asked whether the NHS would be involved in a possible trade deal with the United States, Trump said, ''When you're dealing on trade, everything is on the table - so NHS or anything else, and a lot more than that. Everything will be on the table, absolutely.'' Trump has since backtracked, possibly aware of what a hot-button issue this is in Britain. In his phone-in with Farage a month ago, Trump said, ''It's not for us to have anything to do with your health-care system.'' The British prime minister, in the closing days of an election he is forecast to win, has sought to keep Trump at arm's length. On Friday, Johnson tried to dissuade the American president from offering his opinions on domestic affairs. ''What we don't do traditionally as loving allies and friends, what we don't do traditionally, is get involved in each other's election campaigns,'' Johnson told LBC radio. Johnson on Tuesday stated that he could ''categorically rule out'' that ''any part of the NHS will be on the table in any trade negotiations,'' including Amercian pharmacueticals. The prime minister also called Corbyn's warning that Johnson and Trump had formed an alliance to sell out the NHS, as ''pure Loch Ness Monster, Bermuda Triangle stuff.'' Asked if Trump's support was a possible embarrassment, Johnson said, ''On the contrary, and I have good relations with Washington, the president, with President Macron, Chancellor Merkel, and that's vital for the UK. And we'll be having a series of meetings - bilateral, trilateral of all kinds - in the course of the next couple of days.'' Trump said he would be meeting with Johnson at 10 Downing Street later in the trip.",['ENGLISH'],634,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-KTLWASQWBEI6VKSIQ5Y27TNQEU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST00097CZ', 'className': 'ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DHON', 'className': 'FRENCH PRESIDENTS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N921110CC', 'className': 'HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DLQX', 'className': 'UK LABOUR PARTY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009EOQ', 'className': 'PRIME MINISTERS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000DLPE', 'className': 'UK POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000DKY8', 'className': 'BREXIT'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001194', 'className': 'NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE'}], 'industry': [{'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001194', 'className': 'NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000A0IC', 'className': 'BORIS JOHNSON'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DGXS', 'className': 'EMMANUEL MACRON'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DKC9', 'className': 'JEREMY CORBYN'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DH1G', 'className': 'NIGEL FARAGE'}], 'city': [{'score': '71', 'classCode': 'GX106', 'className': 'LONDON, ENGLAND'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS148', 'className': 'NEW YORK, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GC329', 'className': 'UNITED KINGDOM'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'GC317', 'className': 'FRANCE'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

Nixon, famously a strong political opponent of Kennedy (having lost a close presidential election to his brother in 1960), broke with his usual stance to give the Massachusetts senator a ""pep talk"" following Chappaquiddick, according to Safire's account.

34,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",WORLD,,Measles outbreak leads to shutdown of public services in Samoa,,,The government of Samoa is shutting down all public services for two days to fight a measles outbreak that has killed more than 55 people and infected thousands of others in the South Pacific island nation over the past two months.,"FULL TEXT Nearly 3,900 cases of measles have been reported in the country, whose population is just 200,000. Schools have been shuttered since the government declared the outbreak a national emergency last month. The shutdown, which will take place Thursday and Friday, comes amid a resurgence of measles in dozens of countries in recent years. Worldwide, more than 140,000 people died from measles last year, according to estimates released Tuesday by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention. In Samoa, where vaccination rates are low, more than 150 new cases of infection were disclosed Monday alone. Most of the victims in the country, which is part of the same island chain as American Samoa, have been babies and children under 4. The Samoan government said this week that half of the 29,000 most vulnerable children - those age 6 months to 4 years - had yet to be vaccinated. As in numerous other countries, officials have struggled to stanch mistrust about vaccinations. In Samoa's case, health authorities said many people became wary when two babies died last year after being given vaccines that had been erroneously mixed with an expired muscle relaxant instead of water. Although the measles vaccination rate among infants in the country was as high as 90 percent in 2013, according to the World Health Organization, by last year it had plummeted to 31 percent. Vaccinations were made mandatory for everyone in Samoa last month. ""Our children and people will never become immune to any future epidemic unless we have almost 100 percent vaccination coverage,"" Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said during a visit to hospitals Monday. ""It's the only antidote."" Mobile clinics have reached remote villages and rural areas in recent weeks, and over 110,000 people in Samoa have been vaccinated since early October, according to government figures.

The statement gave no further details. President Barham Salih met with Iraq's main political blocs as a 15-day constitutional deadline to name the next prime minister nears, two Iraqi officials said. Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Madi announced his resignation on Friday. The Sairoon bloc, led by influential Shi'ite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, addressed Salih in a letter and said they gave protesters the right to support a premier of their choice. Tens of protesters gathered around the Hakim shrine in the southern holy city of Najaf, a police official said. The demonstrators demanded that Sadr help them enter and symbolically take control of the shrine. Sadr commands Saraya Salam, a powerful militia group. The protesters believe the shrine is a center for Iranian intelligence operations, the police official said. After hours of tense standoff, a few protesters and some elderly tribal sheikhs were permitted to enter the shrine and inspect it. Officials all requested anonymity in line with regulations. Najaf has been one of the flashpoints in the protest movement, after demonstrators torched the Iranian Consulate there last week. The Hakim shrine has been the focus of recent violence. Three protesters were killed and 24 wounded on Saturday as security forces used live rounds to disperse them from the site. The southern city is the seat of the country's Shi'ite religious authority. At least 400 people have died since the leaderless uprising shook Iraq on Oct. 1, with thousands of Iraqis taking to the streets in Baghdad and the predominantly Shi'ite southern Iraq decrying corruption, poor services, lack of jobs and calling for an end to the political system that was imposed after the 2003 US invasion. Security forces dispersed crowds with live fire, tear gas, and sound bombs last week in Nasiriyah and Najaf, leading to heavy casualties and drawing condemnation from Washington and the United Nations. In an address to the UN Security Council on Tuesday, top United Nations envoy to Iraq Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert deplored the continued use of live ammunition and ""nonlethal devices"" like tear gas that have caused ""horrific injuries or death."" She condemned what she said were ""unlawful arrests and detentions"" targeting anti-government demonstrators. The UN envoy also questioned the status of the government's earlier investigations into the use of live fire and other violence, noting that though arrest warrants had been issued, perpetrators had not been brought to account. Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs David Schenker called the killing of protesters in Nasiriyah ""shocking and abhorrent,"" in remarks to reporters late Monday. ""The Iraqi people are calling for genuine reform implemented by trustworthy leaders who will put Iraq's national interests first.

The Boston Landmarks Commission recently received an application from owner Mark Little to demolish the residence at 799 East Third St. in South Boston ""to make way for a new 4-unit townhouse style development with 8 garaged parking spots.""","FULL TEXT Located in City Point, one of Boston's hottest neighborhoods, the cozy-looking home has been advertised as a developer's dream in a prime location, complete with architectural plans and renderings to build anew. But what the real estate listings haven't said is that it once served as a secret burial ground for Whitey Bulger's gang. The previous asking price of of $3.5 million was lowered to $3,395,000, and the property is currently under agreement, according to            Redfin.com, To newcomers, it's just another piece of pricey real estate. But longtime Southie residents may be aware of the history of this address, and how it became part of Bulger's grisly lore. Back in the early 1980s, the cozy-looking two-story Cape belonged to the brother of Bulger associate Pat Nee, and it had an unfinished dirt-floor basement where three of Bulger's victims were buried. In his testimony during Bulger's racketeering trial, Kevin J. Weeks recounted that he saw Bulger kill Arthur ""Bucky"" Barrett, John McIntyre, and Deborah Hussey in the house. Their bodies remained buried in the basement until 1985, when the house was about to be sold. At that point, Weeks said, the bodies were exhumed and buried across the street from Florian Hall in Dorchester. Bulger was later sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for participating in those murders and eight others while operating his criminal enterprise. The 89-year-old died in prison last October after he was beaten to death. In 1983, Barrett, a bar owner and safecracker who was suspected of a Medford bank burglary, was lured to the South Boston home, chained to a chair, and interrogated for hours by Bulger. Bulger shot Barrett in the head and then took a nap while his associates buried him in the basement, according to testimony. McIntyre was killed after telling law enforcement about a IRA gun-running trip organized by Bulger's gang. Hussey, the 26-year-old daughter of Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi's girlfriend, was strangled by Bulger in early 1985. According to the most recent real estate listing for ""The Haunty,"" the property consists of two attached houses with parking for six cars and a large backyard. It's been marketed as a development opportunity. ""Architectural plans have been approved for 9,766 sq ft sellable building area in PRIME SOUTHIE location between O & P Streets,"" the listing states. ""Full set of ZBA approved 4-unit architectural plans, land survey and renderings are included in sale."" Boston Landmarks Commission staff have ten calendar days to review applications to demolish properties in Boston for historic significance.

But LePage says that won't stop the Christmas spirit from living on. He's passing the reins to six actors from The Sudbury Savoyards, a local theatre company, who will continue LePage's tradition of performing the holiday classic at Longfellow's Wayside Inn in Sudbury and Omni Parker House in Boston. The Savoyards will perform at the Wayside Inn on Friday, Dec. 6, at 7 p.m. and Saturday, Dec. 7, at 2 p.m., with a final show at the Parker House on Sunday, Dec. 15, at 2 p.m.","FULL TEXT LePage, director of the National Coast Trail Association, pursued his passion for history and the environment as a Living History Reenactor volunteer with the National Park Service in Oregon and Washington. He got his feet wet and had a debut performance of ""A Christmas Carol"" at a historic mansion in Astoria, Ore., in 2006. Over the years, he continued to perform. ""I eventually decided to do it in Massachusetts, the place I grew up,"" said LePage, who was raised in Framingham. Flying between Oregon and Massachusetts, LePage continued to perform the story for more than 10 years at the Wayside Inn and eventually the historic Parker House. All proceeds from ticket sales went to the Historic Site Preservation Fund of the Wayside Inn as well as local food pantries, he said. LePage says the story's message especially resonates because ""it is about generosity and personal transformation."" LePage emphasized how his performances were more than just acting - they held historical and personal significance too. His final performance last December commemorated the 175th anniversary of when Dickens wrote and published the Christmas classic in 1843. During his last performance he also made sure to bring his father's sweater with him on stage, leaving it on the chair beside him as he performed. ""My father was the only guy that upstaged me. During my performances, he would stand up and say, 'that's my son up there,'"" LePage recalled with a laugh. ""The audience absolutely loved it, they could tell I was blushing."" His father passed away five years ago, but LePage still keeps his memory close. ""I referenced the sweater and said, 'this is in remembrance of my father, so that he can be here with me for the performance too,'"" he recalled. Unable to maintain the costs of flying to and from Massachusetts, LePage, 65, decided to retire from performing in order to direct his efforts back to what he's always had a passion for - the world's climate. This came with a challenge. ""I wanted the story of generosity to continue. I thought, how am I going to do this?"" He passed his legacy to the Sudbury Savoyards, which runs entirely on volunteers. This will be the group's first time performing the show. ""I think it's a wonderful opportunity for us as a Sudbury-based organization to do another noteworthy activity within Sudbury and build a relationship with the inn,"" said Brendon Chetwynd, current chairman of Sudbury Savoyards.

Dennis Hopkins spoke after judges at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans heard arguments in a case brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP on behalf of six felons including Hopkins. In Mississippi, people convicted of 22 felonies permanently lose the right to vote. They can have their rights restored only by getting a bill passed just for them with two-thirds approval by the Legislature or getting a pardon from the governor. Lawyers for the plaintiffs say Mississippi is one of only three states that permanently bars felons from voting. __ Midnight A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments on whether Mississippi laws that restrict the voting rights of certain felons are unconstitutional. Former convicted felons affected by the state's laws are pushing to have their voting rights restored. The Mississippi Constitution strips people convicted of 10 felonies of the right to vote. Those crimes include murder, forgery and bigamy, and the list was later expanded to 22, including crimes such as timber larceny and carjacking. Those people can get their voting rights restored but only by going through a process of getting individual bills passed just for them with two-thirds approval by the Legislature or getting a pardon from the governor. The plaintiffs argue the laws were enacted in 1890 as a way to disenfranchise black voters.",['ENGLISH'],281,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-A4UULP3RIJELDB5SO3T4SJYGFU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Civil Rights Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDQ0MjEwODdBQzFDNDlEREI1NTFEMjMwQzZDMEVGMEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkM0OEVFRDFGOUFCNEUzMkFDQjk5OTE5QUE2MzJBRjg', 'className': 'Felonies'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'Civil Rights Law'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DO25', 'className': 'VOTER DISQUALIFICATION'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001932', 'className': 'CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009PZT', 'className': 'MAJOR US LAW FIRMS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDRDMjRGNDlCRkYxNDkzNEIwMzIzNTk0NEExQ0YzMTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE', 'className': 'Voting Rights'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JU', 'className': 'CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REE3RUI5RUNDMTgyNDU3Rjk2QUMwOTVBOUI1NDNFOTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk', 'className': 'Criminal Offenses'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0008XMR', 'className': 'LAW & LEGAL SYSTEM'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DMT1', 'className': 'PATENT COURTS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX000302', 'className': 'CIVIL RIGHTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N922110CC', 'className': 'LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000104', 'className': 'APPEALS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N922110GJ', 'className': 'APPEALS COURTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTg1QUIzNkIwNzk5NDQ4NzhGMDdDQjVGNEYyRjY5OTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURENzJGNTEyQzM0NEREQUI2RkVCRTM4RTc1RTZBREU', 'className': 'Judges'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001020', 'className': 'LEGISLATION'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001812', 'className': 'VOTERS & VOTING'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzhDNTg3RDgwRkVENDdEMDg5QjcyRTdBQzI1NEFFMDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTFGRjg4NjA3RTg1NDA2RkIzMDk4QzdGREIyQzVGMDk', 'className': 'Clemency'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000CA2H', 'className': 'POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N541100CC', 'className': 'LEGAL SERVICES'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000108', 'className': 'APPROVALS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001648', 'className': 'SUITS & CLAIMS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NENCREQ3Mjk1QUQ2NEM1OUE2QUE0NjkzNTczM0U2MUQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTdGN0NBMjhBN0VBNDYzOEFCRkQyNDc2RDJDMzc3Mjg', 'className': 'Counterfeiting'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'ST000A2VX', 'className': 'POLYGAMY'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEJEMzA1MDRFQTEzNEM4QTk0RUE0NUJDMjQ4RUE3RTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Carjacking'}], 'industry': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009PZT', 'className': 'MAJOR US LAW FIRMS'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'N540000CC', 'className': 'PROFESSIONAL SERVICES'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N541100CC', 'className': 'LEGAL SERVICES'}], 'city': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GX608', 'className': 'NEW ORLEANS, LA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '95', 'classCode': 'GS140', 'className': 'MISSISSIPPI, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS134', 'className': 'LOUISIANA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

""The process continues,"" he said. ""We have so far not received an entirely satisfactory reply from them, but the exchanges continue."" The U.S. and Israel had been pressing the IAEA for some time to look into the Turquzabad facility, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described to the U.N. in 2018 as a ""secret atomic warehouse."" In November, the agency confirmed that its inspectors had found uranium of man-made origin ""at a location in Iran not declared to the agency."" Israel has alleged that material at the site came from an Iranian military program involving work on nuclear weapons and was subsequently cleared out. Iran denies pursuing nuclear weapons and says its program is peaceful. Responding to criticism that the IAEA dragged its feet in the investigation, Grossi acknowledged that the matter is urgent because samples can degrade. ""The timely response to our questions is very important,"" he added. Grossi, a 58-year-old Argentine diplomat, succeeded Yukiya Amano, who died in July. He takes over for a four-year term at a time when the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers is unraveling. The landmark 2015 deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action promised Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. The IAEA's role has been to inspect and verify Iran's compliance with the deal. With the unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the agreement last year and the imposition of new American sanctions, Iran's economy has struggled. So far, the other nations involved - France, Germany, Britain, China and Russia - have been unable to offset the effects, and Iran has slowly been violating the terms of the JCPOA. Amid the economic discontent, many Iranians have taken to the streets recently to protest rising gasoline prices, and the Iranian government has cracked down violently, killing more than 200 people. Despite the unrest, Grossi said his agency's inspectors have still been able to carry out their work, and Iran has been providing access to nuclear facilities.

Neff, 67, started the job in November 2018 after spending most of his 23-year Fidelity career on the technology side of the company. Neff will be succeeded by Bart Grenier, who is currently head of global asset management at Fidelity International, the company's independently run affiliate in London. Grenier, 60, has worked extensively in Boston, both at Fidelity and The Boston Co., a division of Bank of New York Mellon, where he was CEO from 2011 to 2017. Grenier left BNY Mellon to return to the Fidelity fold, first as an executive vice president in Boston and then as the asset management chief at Fidelity International. He will start his new duties in February, with Neff helping with the transition. Fidelity chairman and CEO Abigail Johnson called Grenier the ""ideal candidate"" to run the asset management business, which has more than 500 funds with nearly $3 trillion in assets.

45,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",WORLD,,Rio Treaty nations move to further isolate Venezuela,,,"Link to Image BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) - Representatives from over a dozen nations that are signatories to a Cold War-era defense treaty for the Americas moved Tuesday to further isolate close allies of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro with economic sanctions.","The 1947 Rio Treaty signatories concluded a meeting in Bogota by vowing to cooperate in pursuing sanctions and travel restrictions for Maduro government associates accused of corruption, drug trafficking, money laundering or human rights violations. ""The political, economic and social crisis in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela represents a threat for the peace and security of the continent,"" Colombian Foreign Minister Claudia Blum said in the meeting's final remarks. While the United States and the European Union have targeted Maduro associates with economic sanctions, Latin American nations who are supporting opposition leader Juan Guaidó have largely resorted to diplomatic pressure - and it will be up to each individual nation to decide how to move forward. The promise of enhanced economic pressure against Maduro comes at a time when Venezuela's opposition is faltering. Guaidó has struggled to mobilize supporters onto the streets and dipped in popularity. Meanwhile, fissures within the opposition are coming to light amidst recent controversies involving alleged abuses of power. David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the Rio Treaty's resolution Tuesday marks a ""small victory"" for the opposition but ""not enough to really put them in a different place."" ""Their strategy of maximum pressure seems to be stalling,"" he said. The 19 Rio Treaty member nations have been treading cautiously in pursuing economic restrictions against Venezuela while vowing not to invoke a provision in the accord that authorizes them to pursue a military intervention. The accord instructs signatories to consider a threat against any one of them a danger to all. Colombian President Iván Duque contends that Maduro is offering a safe haven to rebel factions of the National Liberation Army and dissidents with the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, an assertion the Venezuelan leader denies. Duque urged that nations embark on tougher sanctions going forward. ""Here there's no invitation for use of force,"" he said. Despite repeated remarks from Rio Treaty members indicating they will not pursue a military response, Venezuelan leaders contend the signatories are plotting to overthrow Maduro and warning citizens that an intervention could be imminent. ""The people should be prepared and alert on the streets,"" Diosdado Cabello, head of Venezuela's all-powerful National Constitutional Assembly, said Tuesday.",['ENGLISH'],452,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-KSF72IAKEVHPZNZQBWU54XVUHM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Military & Veterans Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM1OUEyRDNERTdENEU2MTk3RTlCNEJCRUY0NjRGRjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000587', 'className': 'EMBARGOES & SANCTIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000950', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001758', 'className': 'TREATIES & AGREEMENTS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001456', 'className': 'REBELLIONS & INSURGENCIES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000CUW1', 'className': 'NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N928000CC', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000CUUC', 'className': 'REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000A4QF', 'className': 'COLD WAR'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST00098A0', 'className': 'FOREIGN RELATIONS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N928120MM', 'className': 'STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000D5SG', 'className': 'CORRUPTION'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000DNVT', 'className': 'ABUSE & NEGLECT'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000656', 'className': 'EURO'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000CUSS', 'className': 'NARCOTERRORISM'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000A7Q7', 'className': 'SOCIETAL ISSUES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000D73F', 'className': 'EUROPEAN UNION'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DLOJ', 'className': 'GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000A51F', 'className': 'ECONOMIC CRISIS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST0008ZBZ', 'className': 'HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX001136', 'className': 'MILITARY OPERATIONS'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX000535', 'className': 'CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzBDQzA4NEVCN0Q0NEZCRkEwNjY3Qzk3MDA3NzlCMjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkUzNTQ1QUZBM0Y5NDcyQjk4N0I5Mjg0QzU3NDk0MDI', 'className': 'Money Laundering'}, {'score': '62', 'classCode': 'ST0009FAF', 'className': 'TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'ST000CY59', 'className': 'DRUG TRAFFICKING'}], 'industry': [{'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX000656', 'className': 'EURO'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX001136', 'className': 'MILITARY OPERATIONS'}], 'city': [{'score': '71', 'classCode': 'GX083', 'className': 'BOGOTA, COLOMBIA'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC341', 'className': 'COLOMBIA'}, {'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC344', 'className': 'VENEZUELA, BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF'}, {'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST00099QF', 'className': 'EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'GR118', 'className': 'LATIN AMERICA'}]}"
46,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",METRO,,Harvard graduate students walk off the job after negotiations stall,,,"Hundreds of Harvard graduate students walked out of class and off the job on Tuesday kicking off their first strike after contract negotiations with the university stalled. Students marched for hours trudging down snow-covered sidewalks around Harvard Yard carrying signs, banging on empty plastic cans, and chanting ""What do we want? Contract! What do we do if we don't get it? Shut it down!""","FULL TEXT ""The things we're asking for....it would be really easy for Harvard to provide,"" said Sophie Wilkowske, 24, a graduate student in history. ""We're going to stay out here until they do."" The graduate students were joined on the picket line by some professors and undergraduate students. David Carey, a sophomore, walked out with his Spanish class to support his teaching assistants. Much of classroom learning, as well as the help they receive on papers and tests happens in small groups led by graduate students, Carey said. ""They have certain rights that they need to have protected,"" Carey said. The strike comes after more than a year of negotiations between the newly formed graduate student workers union and Harvard officials. The graduate students, who teach classes, grade papers and work in research labs, said they want to send Harvard administrators a message that their labor is valuable and that they should be compensated fairly and offered more protections against sexual harassment and discrimination. Harvard officials have said that a strike is ""unwarranted."" The two sides have made tentative progress toward an agreement over training, travel and support for international graduate students, but remain divided on several key issues, including pay packages and grievance procedures for sexual harassment complaints. The union is seeking better pay, expanded health care and child care benefits, and an outside arbitrator to handle complaints of sexual harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. Graduate student workers have argued that Harvard has historically been slow to address allegations of sexual harassment against longtime professors and that graduate students need the protection of an independent third party. But Harvard officials said the Title IX sexual harassment complaint process has improved significantly in recent years. While other unions on campus have the option to enter arbitration over sexual harassment complaints, none have used that process, instead choosing to go through the university's Title IX office, Harvard officials said. Stipends for Harvard doctoral students vary by school and range from $35,500 to $43,000 annually. Harvard has proposed an 8 percent pay increase over three years for a majority of the graduate students in the union. But union members said that would end up being less than the 3 percent annual raise many of them have received in recent years. The union has countered with a proposal for a 5 percent raise in the first year of the contract and a 3.5 percent increase in subsequent years, according to union representatives. Nationally, graduate student strikes remain rare, but they are becoming more common. Teaching assistants at the University of Illinois Chicago went on a three-week strike earlier this year, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of classes. Last year, graduate student workers at Columbia University in New York picketed for a week to protest administrators' refusal to negotiate. Columbia eventually agreed to bargain. Most strikes on campus last less 10 days or less. Harvard's graduate students workers have authorized an indefinite strike. Deirdre Fernandes can be reached at deirdre.fernandes@globe.com.

Within minutes, firefighters were on their way. Little did they know, when they responded to this call, their lives would be changed forever. The Worcester Fire Department, and the city as a whole, would never be same again. The fire that started inside Worcester Cold Storage and Warehouse Co. turned into a deadly blaze that claimed the lives of six firefighters: Timothy P. Jackson, 51; Joseph T. McGuirk, 38; James F. 'Jay"" Lyons III, 34; Thomas E. Spencer, 42; Paul A. Brotherton, 41; and Jeremiah M. Lucey, 38.","FULL TEXT Today, several of their children - Spencer's son Danny, Lucey's son Jeremiah, and five of Brotherton's sons - serve on the Worcester Fire Department. In the two decades since the tragic warehouse fire, the city has continued to grieve for their fathers and the rest of the ""Worcester Six,"" and on Tuesday evening city officials will honor them with a memorial service on the 20th anniversary of the fire. At 5:30 p.m. past and present members of the Worcester Fire Department, accompanied by color guard and band, will line up at Union Station and then march down Grafton Street to the Franklin Street fire station, where a memorial ceremony will be held at 6 p.m. featuring remarks by Worcester Mayor Joseph M. Petty, Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito, Worcester Fire Chief Michael Lavoie, City Manager Edward M. Augustus Jr. and comedian and actor Denis Leary. The fire impacted Leary profoundly, as he had personal ties to two of the victims (Lucey was his cousin and Lieutenant Spencer was a childhood friend and high school classmate). On Tuesday Leary tweeted a photograph of Lucey on the job, wearing his firefighter helmet and gear. ""My cousin Jerry Lucey in action for @WorcesterFD,"" Leary wrote. ""Back in the day #NeverForget #Worcester6 20 years ago today."" Leary, who established The Leary Firefighters Foundation in 2000, also announced the release of a new mini-documentary series called ""The Worcester 6: Heroes Remembered."" The first episode of the five-part series (below) premiered on the The Leary Firefighters Foundation's website and social media channels Tuesday. In advance of Tuesday's memorial ceremony, the Worcester Fire Department posted an online tribute to Brotherton, Jackson, Lucey, Lyons, McGuirk, and Spencer on Twitter. ""Today, on the 20th anniversary of December 3rd, we remember and honor FF Brotherton, FF Jackson, FF Lucey, FF Lyons, FF McGuirk, LT Spencer. Our Heroes Fallen but not forgotten,"" the tweet said. ""Time may pass, but the impact of their sacrifice lives on within our department and the community we serve."" Some roads will be closed for the memorial event. City officials said there will be temporary road closures in the vicinity of the Franklin Street fire station beginning at 5 p.m., and firefighters from other departments are expected to line the marching route. Travelers should also note that the main entrance to Union Station will be closed from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., but the ADA platform will remain accessible from the station entrance at 45 Shrewsbury St., according to a tweet from MBTA commuter rail officials. A temporary ""pop-up"" exhibit about the ""Worcester Six"" is also currently on display at Union Station. It will be open to the public, free of charge, Tuesday from 12 to 5 p.m. and 7 to 9 p.m., and Wednesday from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., according to the Worcester Fire Museum and Educational Center's Facebook page.

50,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",POLITICS,,Fears deepen for families of people held in Iran amid unrest,,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - Families of several U.S. and British people held in Iran expressed fear for their loved ones Tuesday amid the deadliest unrest in decades in the Islamic Republic. The relatives spoke at a news conference in Washington to demand the release of spouses and parents held in Iran - in at least one case for more than a decade. Among those who spoke was a daughter of Robert Levinson, the former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007.","The protests now roiling Iran, reflecting widespread economic discontent and outrage over spiking gasoline prices, have been an added challenge to families who have gone years without seeing their loved ones. Iranian state television acknowledged Tuesday that security forces shot and killed protesters in multiple cities. ""Of course any kind of protest that goes on in Iran, and any kind of situation, that overlaps potentially with the fact that our families and loved ones are being held there as well,"" said Babak Namazi, whose brother and father are held captive in Iran. ""We've been talking about the brutality of what our family members have been facing. But I guess this is just a reminder of what the abilities and capabilities are."" Prisons are more overcrowded now because of the demonstrations, the internet has been down, and communication has been even more complicated than it already is, Namazi said. Sarah Moriarty, one of Levinson's seven children, said she was heartened by Iran's acknowledgment last month that it had an open case before its Revolutionary Court after years of denying any involvement in his disappearance. Moriarty said she interpreted the development as Iran's first acknowledgment that it had indeed taken Levinson into custody, though Iran has also said it regards Levinson's case as a ""missing person"" file. She said she believes it's clear that Iran knows where her father is and is in a position to send him home immediately. ""This is incredibly significant because it means that they have a case against my father, and it means that they have him,"" Moriarty said. ""And we want to see him, and we want him to be released immediately."" Nearly two dozen of Levinson's relatives are expected in a Washington court this week to testify in a wrongful death lawsuit against Iran that seeks damages against the government. ""We want Iran to know that this is not acceptable, and a big portion of our lawsuit is punitive damages because we want them to discourage them from doing this practice to anyone else,"" Moriarty said. Levinson disappeared from Iran's Kish Island on March 9, 2007. For years, U.S. officials would only say that Levinson, a meticulous FBI investigator credited with busting Russian and Italian mobsters, was working for a private firm on his trip. In December 2013, The Associated Press revealed Levinson in fact had been on a mission for CIA analysts who had no authority to run spy operations. Also present for the news conference was Richard Ratcliffe, whose wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, is a British-Iranian charity worker held in Iran for more than three years. He said that though different Western nations have their own approaches to hostage negotiations, ""none of them have worked."" He said sanctions should be considered as one option of punishment for hostage taking. ""There should be a real clear cost to hostage taking,"" he said. ""It should be an anathema in the modern world.""",['ENGLISH'],575,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-5FGX753A6VELVAGEKGSBQTFMLY,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Torts', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': ""Workers' Compensation & SSDI"", 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTNGOEUzQTYwRUQ1NEFCN0FGMjg0Rjc5MjI3NjBDMEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000691', 'className': 'FAMILY'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001151', 'className': 'MISSING PERSONS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000CVKR', 'className': 'MIDDLE EAST PROTESTS & UPRISINGS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000290', 'className': 'CHILDREN'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODAyQkUzMEMyRkIxNDFENDk1MzM5NkU5ODQzOEREQ0E7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDAwOEM2NTEzQkVDNEI4NzlGMEZERUEyRjQwODM4Njg', 'className': 'Wrongful Death & Survival Actions'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST00099LR', 'className': 'MUSLIMS & ISLAM'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST0008X5W', 'className': 'SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX001648', 'className': 'SUITS & CLAIMS'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX001566', 'className': 'SHOOTINGS'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzQyQ0JFRkFDNDIzNDU3RjhFMkE1N0JEOTFGNzIwQzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEY5RDZFNTJBQzJGNERFQjg0MEIyMEVBRUU4NjI0RjU', 'className': 'Damages'}, {'score': '54', 'classCode': 'STX001464', 'className': 'RELIGION'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'STX001242', 'className': 'OIL & GAS PRICES'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'ST0009GJU', 'className': 'GASOLINE PRICES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '52', 'classCode': 'STX001242', 'className': 'OIL & GAS PRICES'}, {'score': '52', 'classCode': 'ST0009GJU', 'className': 'GASOLINE PRICES'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC368', 'className': 'IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF'}, {'score': '93', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GC329', 'className': 'UNITED KINGDOM'}]}"

Usman Khan stabbed two people to death and injured three others Friday before being shot and killed by police on the bridge.

But Lukasz said the person shown in some video of the day was not him. ""I and several others tried to stop a man from attacking people inside the building,"" he said. ""I did this using a pole I found. Someone else was holding a narwhal tusk."" Khan was attending an event at the hall and had returned for the afternoon session when he started stabbing people. Police believe he acted alone. He was pursued onto London Bridge and restrained by staff from the venue and others from the conference, including former inmates. Police shot him after he flashed what looked like a suicide vest. It turned out to be fake. ""The man attacked me, after which he left the building,"" he said. ""A number of us followed him out but I stopped at the bollards of the bridge. I had been stabbed and was later taken to hospital to be treated.

52,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,AP FACT CHECK: Trump's misstatements at NATO summit,,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday wholly misrepresented the U.S. record on international trade disputes and dismissed as a mysterious ""rumor"" his own statement from months ago about Britain's health system. Here's a look at some of his statements from London, where's he is attending a NATO meeting: TRUMP: ""We won, in the World Trade Organization, we won seven and a half billion dollars. We never used to win before me, because, before me, the United States was a sucker for all of these different organizations."" - remarks with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. THE FACTS: He is wildly wrong to state that the U.S. never won victories in disputes taken to the trade organization before him.","The U.S. has always had a high success rate when it pursues cases against other countries at the WTO. In 2017, trade analyst Daniel Ikenson of the libertarian Cato Institute found that the U.S. had won 91% of times it brought a complaint that ended up being adjudicated by the Geneva-based trade monitor. As Ikenson noted, countries bringing complaints to the organization tend to win because they don't bother going to the WTO in the first place if they don't have a strong case. As for his claim that the U.S. ""won"" $7.5 billion from the WTO, that's not quite right. Trump was referring to a WTO decision in October  siding with the U.S. on imposing tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European imports annually. The value of the tariffs on those imports is much less than $7.5 billion. The WTO announcement culminated a 15-year fight over EU subsidies for Airbus - a fight that began long before Trump was in office. ___ TRUMP: ""We have a tremendous amount of captured fighters, ISIS fighters over in Syria. And, they're all under lock and key, but many are from France, many are from Germany. Many are from U.K. They are mostly from Europe."" - remarks with French President Emmanuel Macron. MACRON: There are ""very large number of fighters ... ISIS fighters coming from Syria, from Iraq and the region."" Those from Europe are ""a tiny minority of the overall problem."" THE FACTS: Trump is incorrect to say the Islamic State fighters who were captured and held by the Kurds in Syria are mostly from Europe. Of the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. Most of the captured fighters - about 10,000 - are natives of Syria or Iraq. European nations have indeed been reluctant to take detainees who came from Europe, frustrating Trump. But such detainees are far fewer than the majority he frequently claims. ___ TRUMP, speaking about claims that Britain's state-funded health care system would be part of future U.K.-U.S. trade talks: ""I don't even know where that rumor started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn't want to. If you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it."" - remarks with Jens Stoltenberg. THE FACTS: He's referring to his own past statements as a ""rumor."" Asked about the National Health Service during a visit to Britain in June, he said ""when you're dealing in trade, everything's on the table. So, NHS or anything else."" The service, which provides free health care to all Britons, could in fact be a bargaining chip in U.S.-U.K. trade talks. U.S. health-services firms can already bid for contracts if they have European subsidiaries. A future government could increase the amount of private-sector involvement or let U.S. companies bid directly. As well, the U.S. could demand during trade talks that Britain pay American pharma firms more for drugs. Medicines became a big issue in negotiations on a revamped North American free trade deal, as the U.S. pushed successfully for tighter restrictions on the development in Canada and Mexico of generic versions of U.S.-patented drugs. Leaked documents from preliminary talks between U.S. and U.K. negotiators over two years from July 2017 - released by the Labour Party last week - said ""patent issues"" around ""NHS access to generic drugs will be a key consideration"" in talks. It's an overstatement to say the national health service as a whole would be up for sale, as Labour has alleged will happen if Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives win the Dec. 12 election and try to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the U.S. Britain would not be ""selling off"" the health service, as Labour asserts, because taxpayers would still be footing the bill. But it's also improbable to think U.S. negotiators would ""want nothing to do"" with Britain's health care market, despite Trump's words. ___ TRUMP, on protecting oilfields in Syria: ""We have the oil, and we can do with the oil what we want."" - remarks with Stoltenberg. THE FACTS: That's not true. The oil in Syria belongs to Syria and the U.S. can't do anything it wants with it. As secretary of state, Rex Tillerson reviewed whether the U.S. could make money off the oil-rich areas and concluded there was no practical way to do so, said Brett McGurk, Trump's former special envoy to the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State. ""Maybe there are new lawyers now, but it was just illegal for an American company to go and seize and exploit these assets,"" McGurk told a panel on Syria held in October by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Stephen Vladeck, a national security law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said there is no solid legal argument the Trump administration could make if it sought to claim Syria's oil. While Trump has said he will withdraw the bulk of roughly 1,000 American troops from Syria, he's made clear he will leave some military forces in the country to help secure the oil from any Islamic State resurgence. The Pentagon has said it is committed to sending additional military forces to eastern Syria to ""reinforce"" control of the oil fields and prevent them from ""falling back to into the hands of ISIS or other destabilizing actors."" ___ EDITOR'S NOTE - A look at the veracity of claims by political figures. ___ Lawless reported from London.

Ambassador Danny Danon told the U.N. General Assembly that he plans to propose a resolution about what he called ""the 'forgotten' Jewish refugees"" to counter what Israel sees as a one-sided focus on Palestinian refugees.","""We don't hear the international community speak of them when they discuss the refugees of the conflict, perhaps because it doesn't serve the Palestinian narrative,"" Danon said. He didn't detail his planned resolution, except to say that it would ""acknowledge the wrong done"" to the Jews in question and ""make right the injustice that they suffered."" There was no immediate response from the Palestinian mission to his remarks. Earlier Tuesday, Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour reiterated appeals for humanitarian aid for Palestinian refugees. Danon's remarks came as the assembly weighed a draft resolution reiterating a roster of longstanding positions on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. The proposed measure includes calls for continued humanitarian and economic aid to the Palestinians and a stop to Israeli settlement of areas Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war - a stance given new resonance by the recent U.S. announcement that it no longer believes the settlements violate international law. Danon said an estimated 850,000 Jews were forced out of Iraq, Egypt, Morocco, Iran, and many other countries during the 20th century after enduring violence and persecution. Many fled to the new state of Israel after the war surrounding its creation in 1948. The uprooted Jews were absorbed in Israel, where their descendants now make up about half the country's Jewish population. Refugee recognition may be largely symbolic at this juncture, but it reflects Israel's determination to highlight what it considers to be years of pro-Palestinian bias at the U.N., including on the issue of refugees. An estimated 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes during the war. A U.N. agency still exists to assist them and their descendants - all told, about 5.5 million people - in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The Palestinians and the U.N. see its Relief and Works Agency as a lifeline for impoverished people with no state of their own. International support for it is ""an indispensable source of hope and stability until a just solution for the Palestine refugees is realized,"" Mansour told the General Assembly on Tuesday. Israel and the United States, however, have lambasted UNRWA as anti-Israel and badly run. The U.S. cut its funding for the agency from $360 million in 2017 to $60 million in 2018 and nothing this year, calling the agency ""irredeemably flawed."" On the settlements issue, the draft resolution stresses a call for ""an immediate halt to all settlement activities."" Hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, areas that Palestinians claim for their future state. The U.N. and the Palestinians say the settlements are illegal and undermine hopes for the long-discussed two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 2016, a U.N. Security Council resolution called the settlements ""a flagrant violation under international law."" The U.S. announcement last month upended a four-decade-old State Department legal opinion and subsequent years of carefully calibrated U.S. opposition to settlement construction. Israeli leaders welcomed the U.S. decision. Palestinians bitterly protested it. ___ Associated Press writer Aron Heller in Jerusalem contributed to this report.",['ENGLISH'],617,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-AKGKGZHPDFC2LPGD77ZQYCY2ZY,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Immigration Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUM5ODIzNEVDM0VCNDU1OTkyMDZCRUU1Q0ZCMzM4NDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0VDRDc0NDNBMjkwNDJBMEFCOUNGMTU1QzFBRTIyMTk', 'className': 'Refugee Status'}, {'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST000DKU4', 'className': 'UNITED NATIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000950', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00099LS', 'className': 'JEWS & JUDAISM'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00097CV', 'className': 'UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'International Law'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'N928120KM', 'className': 'INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DKU8', 'className': 'MIGRATION ISSUES'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST00099LR', 'className': 'MUSLIMS & ISLAM'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST00096UX', 'className': 'POOR POPULATION'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000CA2H', 'className': 'POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS'}], 'country': [{'score': '97', 'classCode': 'GC701', 'className': 'STATE OF PALESTINE'}, {'score': '97', 'classCode': 'GC333', 'className': 'ISRAEL'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC332', 'className': 'EGYPT'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC368', 'className': 'IRAN, ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC358', 'className': 'IRAQ'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC370', 'className': 'JORDAN'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC373', 'className': 'LEBANON'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GR132', 'className': 'MIDDLE EAST'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC360', 'className': 'MOROCCO'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC363', 'className': 'SYRIA'}]}"
54,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",METRO,,These local mothers made an interactive map of some of the best sledding spots in the region,,,"Link to Image If you're a parent of one of the many children who didn't have to trudge off to school Tuesday because of the major            snowstorm, and you've already exhausted all of your options to            avoid going stir crazy indoors, it may be time to grab a sled and step outside. Luckily, a group of local mothers can tell you exactly where to go.","FULL TEXT Community Kangaroo, a collaborative website that tracks and logs family-friendly activities around the state, has been building a map of some of the best sledding spots in the Boston suburbs for the past few years. To date, the team of 18 mothers who contribute to the website has amassed dozens of locations where little ones - or not so little ones - can shred some powder. The suggestions are based on input from residents in the communities where each hill can be found, and covers a wide swath of places from Boston to Worcester. ""It can be hard to know where an open hill is to sled,"" said Sharon Aigler, a Millis resident and mother of three who founded Community Kangaroo in 2015. ""Also for people who have a favorite hill, a lot of times they want to try something else. Maybe they have outgrown their favorite hill or want some variety."" The interactive Sledding Map sorts each sledding location into three color-coded categories, so parents can figure out which area works best for their kids. There are ""Small Hills,"" which are marked in purple and described as ""perfect for pre-K"" and those just getting their boots wet; ""Large Hills,"" which are marked in green and aimed at sledders of varying experience and age; and ""Intense Thrill"" hills. The latter are marked in red and are mostly former ski slopes - hills that are ""not for the faint of heart,"" the website warns. When a user clicks on one of the color-coded icons, which are scattered around the state, it pulls up the site's address as well as additional information about its particular features. For example, a purple spot in Stoughton is listed as a ""Great little toddler/learning hill."" And in Marlborough, sledders can find an ""Extreme hill."" Be warned: the map also comes with a disclaimer. Because it was built based on information  gathered from online groups and through word-of-mouth, Community Kangaroo reminds parents bringing their children to any of the locations pinpointed on the map to be cautious when exploring each spot. ""We can't ensure accuracy or safety, and have not independently verified permission on private property,"" the website says. ""Sled at your own risk."" Aigler, a former high school teacher, said the map can be helpful to parents because sledding isn't something that's advertised like a business. You either know where the spots are, or you don't. Putting the locations all in one place also eliminates the hassle of driving around until you find the right location for your child. ""There are lists of sledding hills out there, but they cover just the big ones,"" Aigler said. ""So we try to cater to everybody."" The website, which covers about 60 towns, is always accepting new additions to its map. If sledding isn't on your family's to-do list this winter, Aigler said Community Kangaroo offers a plethora of alternatives, including dates and times of fairs, festivals, and other events, and a map of where the best Christmas and holiday lights can be found. ""The strength of the website is the team of moms scattered throughout the suburbs,"" Aigler said. ""And when they're all finding information right near them, then we get some great work done.""

55,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,Asylum seekers jam US border crossings to evade Trump policy,,,"Link to Image PHOENIX (AP) - For months, asylum seekers have been prohibited from filing their claims at U.S. border crossings under a much-criticized Trump administration policy. Now some are sprinting down vehicle lanes or renting cars to try to make it inside the U.S.","The migrants' efforts are causing traffic delays at Arizona crossings because U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials had to barricade lanes used by cars legally entering the U.S. from Mexico, officials said. Shoppers, teachers and visitors traveling to the U.S. through Nogales, Mexico, endured up to five-hour waits Monday and over the weekend, causing concerns among local officials whose tax base relies on Mexican shoppers, especially during the holiday season. In a statement, Customs and Border Protection said it's committed to the safety of border crossers, adding that there's been an increase of incursions through vehicle lanes ""by asylum seekers attempting to evade established entry processes."" ""These tactics interfere with CBP officers conducting their responsibilities and exacerbates wait times for daily commuters,"" the agency said in a statement. ""CBP will not allow ports to be overrun, or unauthorized entry."" The traffic jams could hurt sales at stores in Nogales, Arizona that depend on Mexican shoppers during the holiday season, said Mayor Arturo Garino. Garino, a part-time teacher, said some students and teachers who live in Mexico but attend and work at schools across the border in the U.S. have been leaving their homes as early as 5 a.m. to arrive on time. Garino said Mexican authorities were not doing enough to stem the problem. The Arizona Daily Star reported the Nogales, Sonora, police officers were checking cars headed north to the border on Monday afternoon. The metal barricades are large and are meant to seal off traffic lanes. About 3,000 migrants are living in Nogales, Mexico as they wait their turns to seek asylum, said Katie Sharar, communications director for the Kino Border Initiative, a religious-based group that provides meals to needy migrants on the Mexican side of the border. Under a policy by the Trump administration known widely as ""metering,"" the asylum-seekers must wait in an unofficial line in Mexico until U.S. authorities call them up in a process that usually lasts several months. Another policy, colloquially known as ""Remain in Mexico,"" requires asylum seekers to return to Mexico after they have made credible fear claims to justify their asylum requests and wait there while their immigration cases are pending. ""I think there's just a lot of desperation and uncertainty. They don't know what's happening to them, they don't know how the policy changes are gonna affect them,"" Sharar said. Sharar said she wasn't familiar with the migrants who have run through vehicle lanes. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to email and phone messages regarding questions about the migrants who rushed the border, what countries they come from and whether they were detained or faced criminal charges. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, said his first concern is public safety and that he is confident that U.S. officials will resolve the border traffic problems. ___ Associated Press writer Bob Christie in Phoenix contributed to this report.",['ENGLISH'],546,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-DMPX6U6L7JFLJIIBUZASDB2LAE,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Immigration Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'International Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000A22R', 'className': 'BORDER CONTROL'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000665', 'className': 'EXCISE & CUSTOMS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDZDMTEwQ0Q4MTlDNDIxOUI5OEFDMjg1NDMzMTVFQjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ', 'className': 'Territorial Boundaries'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0IyQzc2NTFGMjM2NDRBMkEwQUFBREJBNUI1Q0RCN0M7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZCMUU5OEUyREYzNDM4MjkzMkFCQzA0MTM3QUY1NjQ', 'className': 'Asylum'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REI2NEE4Nzk1Nzc3NEIzQkFFMzE2ODAyNUQzQkQ2Q0I7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY', 'className': 'Faculty & Staff'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001691', 'className': 'TEACHING & TEACHERS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000466', 'className': 'DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'Federal Government'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DIDA', 'className': 'COMMUTING'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000855', 'className': 'HOLIDAYS & OBSERVANCES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST0009HPZ', 'className': 'STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'STX001464', 'className': 'RELIGION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001794', 'className': 'VEHICLE TRAFFIC'}], 'state': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'GS118', 'className': 'ARIZONA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '98', 'classCode': 'GC342', 'className': 'MEXICO'}, {'score': '95', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GR120', 'className': 'NORTH AMERICA'}]}"

The Harvard Law School professor, who will be one of four academics testifying Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee as it probes the legal grounds for impeaching President Trump, co-authored the textbook ""Constitutional Law."" But that is only the tip of the iceberg of the prolific writing of the prominent public intellectual. He co-authored another textbook, on the First Amendment, as well as seven other non-fiction books that covered topics ranging from President James Madison to America's ""church-state problem"" to the fall and rise of the Islamic State.","FULL TEXT The Boston native is also a Bloomberg News opinion columnist and hosts a podcast called            ""Deep Background."" He has contributed to the New York Times magazine and New York Review of Books. And he does not shy away from            various media appearances. Feldman ""specializes in constitutional studies, with a particular emphasis on the relationship between law and religion, free speech, constitutional design, and the history of legal theory,"" according to the Harvard Law website. After receiving his bachelor's degree in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from Harvard University in 1992, he was selected as a Rhodes Scholar and earned a D.Phil. from Oxford University in 1994. He received his law degree from Yale Law School in 1997, according to the Harvard website. He clerked for a District of Columbia Appeals Court judge as well as for Supreme Court Justice David Souter. Before joining the Harvard faculty he was a law professor at New York University School of Law. When he left NYU for Harvard in 2007, Elena Kagan, dean of Harvard Law at the time (she is now a Supreme Court justice) hailed him as one of the ""stars of his generation.""  He had been dubbed ""Most Beautiful Brainiac"" by New York magazine during his time in that city. Esquire in 2008 called him ""a public intellectual for our time."" In 2003, he brought his legal skills to bear in a turbulent situation, serving as senior constitutional adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, and subsequently advising members of the Iraqi Governing Council on the drafting of the Transitional Administrative Law or interim constitution, according to the Harvard Law website. The New York Times reported at the time that questions were being raised about Feldman's youth - he was 32 at the time - but a consensus was emerging that, because of his studies in Islamic thought at Oxford and in constitutional law, he was a good choice. Feldman grew up in Boston as an Orthodox Jew. He learned Hebrew and Aramaic to read the ancient and medieval texts taught at the Maimonides School, a private Jewish school in Brookline. He then started Arabic at 15 in summer school, the Times reported. His interest in the law came after his interest in Islam. His expertise in the two fields suddenly became especially valuable after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, the Times reported. What might Feldman say to the committee? In a PBS-TV interview in late October with Walter Isaacson, Feldman may have given some clues. He said he felt President Trump's pressuring Ukraine for a political benefit was an impeachable offense. ""To me, the abuse of power is the thing that the Constitution says that the president should be be impeached for. And you define 'abuse of power' by the idea that the president is doing something that's within his constitutional authority, it's within his power, like putting pressure on a foreign government, but he's doing it not to serve the interests of the United States but to serve his personal interest and the interest of getting reelected. And that's, to my mind, very clearly what's going on,"" he said. ""What matters is the president is overtly saying to Ukraine, 'Do these investigations,' and the only party who can benefit from those investigations is Donald Trump,"" said Feldman. He said he felt it was also an impeachable offense when Trump later issued a similar call publicly to China. ""That's also openly calling on a foreign state to help the president get reelected not to serve the interests of the United States as a republic. That's the textbook definition of an abuse of power,"" he said.

59,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,Black victims underrepresented in named violent crime laws,,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image CLEVELAND (AP) - The slayings of Reagan Tokes and Alianna DeFreeze had much in common. Both were abducted, raped and killed in Ohio in 2017. Tokes was a 21-year-old college student, DeFreeze a 14-year-old seventh grader. Both their killers, previously convicted sex offenders, were subsequently found guilty. Yet only one victim got a law with her name on it - Tokes, who was white. That disparity in so-called namesake laws represents a national trend: White crime victims are much more likely to get crime bills named after them than black victims.","An Associated Press analysis found that more than eight in 10 stand-alone laws named for victims of violent crime since 1990 honored white victims or groups of victims that included at least one white person. Namesake laws have been a popular way for lawmakers to recognize victims of horrific crimes and enact tough-on-crime laws, and many of them have become common parlance in the national criminal justice discussion. AMBER Alerts that warn the public to look out for a missing child are named for Amber Hagerman, a white 9-year-old from Texas who was killed after being abducted while riding her bike with her brother. Sex offender registries and notification systems were set up under federal and state laws named for 6-year-old Adam Walsh, 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling and 7-year-old Megan Kanka, all white children abducted and killed by sex offenders. Racial disparity in such laws has left black victims such as DeFreeze underrepresented. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, black young people in her age range - from 12 to 19 - experience violent crime at significantly higher rates than their white peers, including being five times more likely to be victims of homicide. The AP's analysis showed that only about 6 percent of namesake bills related to violent crimes were named after black victims. The Tokes and DeFreeze murders have led some Ohio lawmakers to question whether racial preference is a factor in the naming of crime laws. The issue is back before lawmakers in at least three separate bills that are expected to see more debate this month. ""All of our babies, all of our women, all of our men, people who lose their lives, everybody is worthy of being acknowledged,"" said Ohio state Rep. Stephanie Howse, a Cleveland Democrat who is black and who publicly objected to the Legislature's differing treatment of Tokes and DeFreeze last year. ""The system that we are in has made a determination of who is more valuable than others."" DeFreeze's mother, Donnesha Cooper, said it was devastating when a bill that would have created an ""Alianna's Alert"" failed to pass last year. She wanted a stand-alone bill named for her daughter that would require schools to inform parents within an hour if a child without an excuse didn't show up for class. The family and a pending wrongful death lawsuit allege that's something her school, E Prep & Village Prep Woodland Hills, a Cleveland charter school, did not do in DeFreeze's case. The school is contesting the suit's allegations; its attorney declined comment. Her daughter was abducted near a city bus stop while on her way to early morning tutoring. Cooper didn't learn the teen was missing until 4 p.m., when she says it was too late to save her. ""It was hurtful, because I thought that the bill having her name on it would be a part of her legacy, I really did. So that everybody would know that this bill was passed for the sake of future lives - and my daughter lost her life in the process, for a change to happen,"" she said. ""And they didn't even put her name on it."" Democratic state Sen. Sandra Williams, who proposed the bill, said a compromise - extending the required alert window from one to two hours - was necessary to appease wealthier school districts. The weakened language finally cleared the House at the end of last year, folded quietly into a sweeping education bill that also addressed teacher preparation, cybersecurity and issues related to the state's universities. The Reagan Tokes Act is back in the Legislature this month as lawmakers advance provisions that were excluded from the first bill. They also are considering other namesake bills. One is Erin's Law, a child sexual abuse prevention bill named for survivor and activist Erin Merryn, who is white; another, Aisha's Law, is named for a Cleveland domestic violence victim who was murdered by her ex-lawmaker husband and was black. ""Having a law named for a white victim versus an African American victim or a Hispanic victim does not inherently mean that people of all races don't benefit from that legislation,"" said Teresa Kulig, an assistant criminology professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. ""But it is kind of an important indication of who is highlighted in these laws."" Kulig and criminologist Francis T. Cullen co-authored a 2016 report that found that 86% of 51 laws named for victims of murder, rape and other violent crimes from 1990 to 2016 were named for white victims. The AP analysis, which included laws from the study as well as bills enacted since 2016, found the pattern continued largely unchanged. Exceptions included the Lavinia Masters Act, aimed at eliminating Texas' rape kit backlog, and Tennessee's JaJuan Latham Act, which toughened criminal penalties in drive-by shootings. Both laws were named for black victims and passed just this year. That contributed to the 6% of bills named for black victims. Another 5% were named for other minorities and the rest were named for whites or groups that included at least one white person. Several of the groups also included blacks or other minorities. Kulig said it is important to acknowledge that named laws generally spring from tragedies: abductions, murders, domestic assaults, child abuse cases. Pointing out the racial disparities isn't intended to diminish the pain of the mostly white families such laws honor, she said. Ohio Rep. Kristin Boggs, a Columbus Democrat, sponsored the Reagan Tokes Act. She said the case exposed flaws in Ohio's parole system that demanded a legislative response. Tokes, a psychology major at Ohio State University, was kidnapped after leaving her restaurant job, raped and killed. Her body was later found in a park in Grove City, near Columbus. Tokes' killer had been released from prison two months before and was wearing an electronic monitor at the time. ""To me, it just feels like she was someone who was truly organically interwoven into a community in the deepest ways, and what happened to her was just so terrifying because everyone saw a piece of themselves in her,"" said Boggs, who is white. Boggs said she couldn't deny that some implicit racial bias exists in the Ohio Legislature, but said she doesn't believe her colleagues are judging namesake bills based on victims' ethnicity. The Tokes legislation, she said, was propelled by passionate lobbying by the family, which declined an AP request for comment through their attorney, and intense media attention to the case. Opponents of namesake laws, including civil-rights groups, criminal defense attorneys and some lawmakers, see an added twist: The new criminal penalties imposed by namesake bills named largely for white victims fall disproportionately on blacks. ""Here comes Annie's law, Laura's law, Marcy's law, Judy's law, and soon we'll have a whole sorority of victims enshrined in the Ohio criminal code,"" Barry Wilford, then-public policy chairman at the Ohio Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, told a news conference called to highlight the disparity. Not everyone sees it that way. Crime victim advocates say enacting laws named for lost loved ones can provide an important outlet for grieving families. Cooper said working to promote a law named after her daughter was the only thing that got her out of the house after her daughter's murder. She still believes her effort was worth it, even if it resulted in legal changes that fell short of a stand-alone namesake law. ""When you hear laws that are named after people, you know what they are and you know why they came to be,"" Cooper said. ""Like, everybody knows the AMBER Alert. And everybody should know the Alianna Alert, because it was horrific. But it will save lives."" ___ Associated Press news researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Carr Smyth at http://www.twitter.com/jcarrsmyth",['ENGLISH'],1410,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-22W3DMKDEBABRCFT4GIEHWDMFM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Civil Rights Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001932', 'className': 'CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Sex Crimes'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REE3RUI5RUNDMTgyNDU3Rjk2QUMwOTVBOUI1NDNFOTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk', 'className': 'Criminal Offenses'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001806', 'className': 'VIOLENT CRIME'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEI3OTJEMzAyQUJCNDc1OEI2QkQyQzVDQTRDNUEwNTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Kidnapping'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTBBQjYwQkYwN0ZGNDQzOTlEMjIyRDEyMkE1RTAwRjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFENzYyRUI3RjFENEUwOEIyN0U0NEZBQjE5RjExMzk', 'className': 'Abuse of Children'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001444', 'className': 'RACE & ETHNICITY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEY2MzZGQUY0QTIzNDk2MjkxNEQwRDBCQzc1M0RFNTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REE3RUI5RUNDMTgyNDU3Rjk2QUMwOTVBOUI1NDNFOTY', 'className': 'Homicide, Manslaughter & Murder'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ5ODg4NkU4QzRDNDhFMDkzQTg0QkMxMjVBMzQyRjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEY2MzZGQUY0QTIzNDk2MjkxNEQwRDBCQzc1M0RFNTY', 'className': 'Murder'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001803', 'className': 'VICTIMS RIGHTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST00097CJ', 'className': 'JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JU', 'className': 'CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0008XMR', 'className': 'LAW & LEGAL SYSTEM'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001759', 'className': 'TRENDS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000DNEU', 'className': 'MISSING PERSON ALERTS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000DNVL', 'className': 'OFFENDER REGISTRIES'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX001627', 'className': 'STATISTICS'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX607', 'className': 'CLEVELAND, OH, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GS151', 'className': 'OHIO, USA'}]}"

(AP) - A dog who was dubbed the unicorn puppy because of a tail-like growth between his eyes will remain with the founder of a Missouri rescue group, despite more than 300 offers to adopt him.","The beagle-mix puppy, named Narwhal the Little Magical Furry Unicorn, was rescued in November by Mac's Mission in southeast Missouri. He drew international attention when his picture hit social media, prompting all the adoption offers but also some negative attention, including death threats, said Rochelle Steffen, founder of the Mac's Mission in Jackson. Those two factors - plus the dog's winning personality - convinced Steffen to reverse an earlier decision to find a new home for Narwhal, she told The Southeast Missourian. She said her tiny rescue could not properly vet the 300 adoption applicants and she was concerned by ""stupid, ugly comments (online) about this sweet little puppy."" People have shown up at the rescue in Jackson because of the dog, prompting security measures and meetings ""by appointment only,"" Steffen said. Narwhal is watched at all times by Steffen and trusted volunteers. Steffen said she wanted to keep the dog safe and was concerned he could be exploited by someone without his best interests at heart. ""If somebody is going to make money off of him, I would love to see it go toward the rescue, and save thousands more dogs,"" Steffen said. People have made ""giant"" offers to buy him, Steffen said. ""But he's not for sale."" And the dog's cute personality made it difficult to consider giving him to someone else, she said. ""It's not just a decision from me,"" she said. ""The whole rescue cannot fathom him leaving. We all fell in love with him."" Mac's Mission is currently involved in a court case involving the sale of a previously adopted dog, which taught Steffen that the organization loses control over an animal's fate once it is adopted. And the mission's former treasurer, Elizabeth Hann, is awaiting trial on charges that she stole $120,000 from the organization, which specializes in caring for animals with special needs. ""We have had a rough couple of years here,"" Steffen said of Mac's Mission. ""Lots of loss, lots of hurt."" And Mac, the mission's current ""spokesdog"", turns 9 in January. Steffen said she wasn't sure what was going to happen until Narwhal came along, saying he is ""absolutely, exactly what we needed."" She said the dog will be a spokesdog for a ""Different is awesome"" campaign and the long-term plan is to train him as a therapy dog. For now, Steffen is concentrating on letting him grow, and getting him fully vaccinated and socialized. ___ Information from: Southeast Missourian, http://www.semissourian.com",['ENGLISH'],450,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-C6TEVHPGK5H7XMGOZ6DCFLT5ZQ,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000A38F', 'className': 'MARINE MAMMALS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000A7IS', 'className': 'ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000092', 'className': 'ANIMAL WELFARE'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000523', 'className': 'DOGS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'ST000DLGZ', 'className': 'ANIMAL SHELTERS & RESCUES'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000D0VJ', 'className': 'SOCIAL MEDIA'}], 'industry': [{'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000D0VJ', 'className': 'SOCIAL MEDIA'}], 'state': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GS141', 'className': 'MISSOURI, USA'}]}"
61,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,Stocks fall a 3rd straight day amid more trade worries,,,"Stocks closed broadly lower and bond prices rose sharply on Wall Street Tuesday after President Trump cast doubt over the potential for a trade deal with China this year. Stocks of technology and industrial companies and banks accounted for much of the sell-off, which extended the S&P 500's losing streak to a third day. Utilities and real estate stocks rose as traders favored less-risky assets. Trump said he has ''no deadline'' for a trade deal and doesn't mind waiting until after the 2020 election to make one. Investors had been hoping for a deal this year, or at least enough progress to stave off new US tariffs on Chinese goods, including smartphones and laptops, scheduled to start Dec. 15.","FULL TEXT Tensions between the two nations flared anew last week after Trump signed legislation expressing US support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. ""We're running out of time and the markets are finally woken up to 'Hey, there's a risk out there and maybe things aren't going to be all good after all,'"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading & derivatives at Charles Schwab. The S&P 500 index fell 20.67 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,093.20. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 280.23 points, or 1 percent, to 27,502.81. The index was briefly down 457 points. The Nasdaq dropped 47.34 points, or 0.6 percent, to 8,520.64. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gave up 4.95 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,602.63. Stocks have been racking up losses this week, giving up some of the market's solid gains from a strong November rally fueled partly by investor optimism about the prospects for a trade deal between Washington and Beijing. Pressure has been building on both sides to complete what Trump has called a limited ''Phase 1'' deal before the new tariffs on Chinese goods kick in Dec. 15. ""We're less than two weeks away from new tariffs that will be implemented on a bunch of consumer goods that have never had tariffs on them, and I think that's when the consumer really starts to feel the pain,"" Frederick said. Wall Street is also weighing the potential for an expanded series of trade disputes. On Tuesday, Trump proposed tariffs on $2.4 billion in French products in retaliation for a tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon, and Facebook. That follows a threat Monday to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum from Argentina and Brazil. The lack of a trade deal before the year ends could mean the market is in for a turnaround from a strong, record-setting November. The S&P 500 had its best month since June with a 3.4 percent gain because of cooling trade tensions and optimism that a resolution to the dispute was near. Two days of deflated hopes has already sent the S&P 500 about 1.5 percent lower and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has slipped 1.7 percent. December is a typically solid month for the stock market, with the S&P 500 making gains regularly since the last recession ended in 2009. Last year, though, fears about a recession and rising interest rates hurt the major indexes. Technology stocks led the losses Tuesday. The sector is highly sensitive to twists in the trade dispute because many of the companies rely on China for sales and supply chains. Apple slumped 1.8 percent, and Intel fell 2.8 percent. Bank stocks also suffered heavy losses as investors headed for the safety of bonds and pushed yields lower. Banks rely on higher bond yields to charge more lucrative interest rates on mortgages and other loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell sharply to 1.72 percent from 1.83 percent late Monday. Bank of America shed 1.8 percent, and Citigroup fell 1.6 percent. Utilities and real estate companies held up the best as investors shifted money to the safe-play sectors. Traders sent shares in Cleveland-Cliffs 10.7 percent lower after the iron-ore miner said it will pay $1.1 billion for steel maker AK Steel. US steel producers have struggled since the Trump administration put a 25 percent steel tariff into place last year. Domestic demand has slumped as oil and gas drillers pull back on purchases of steel pipe. The price for hot rolled steel has slid almost 30 percent this year. AK Steel rose 4.2 percent. Lands' End vaulted 21 percent after the clothing maker reported surprisingly good fourth-quarter earnings and raised its profit forecast for the year.

62,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",METRO,,Solutions for the traffic crisis? Globe readers have plenty.,,,"Link to Image The Globe Spotlight Team's series on our region's transportation crisis, ""Seeing Red,"" hit a nerve with readers. Facing some of the country's worst rush-hour traffic, and grappling with a strained and unreliable transit system, hundreds of Globe readers poured out their perspectives on the problem, sharing their Boston-area transportation horror stories and suggesting ways to break the gridlock. The Globe received more than 600 online comments on the series, and more than 200 readers responded to requests for proposed solutions and other feedback, including tips and comments e-mailed to commuting@globe.com and a special            feedback forum linked from each story. Reader questions will be aired at a            Globe event Tuesday night, Dec. 3, 6 to 7:30 p.m. at 1 Faneuil Hall Square. The event, moderated by Globe columnist Shirley Leung, features Spotlight reporters who worked on the series, as well as transportation officials. Here are some of the readers' solutions, edited and condensed:","FULL TEXT Carrots and sticks ""We haven't done enough with social psychology to encourage and reward good transportation behaviors. Boston should have a sustainable commuting challenge. Let's scrap the Safest Driver Competition that the city of Boston introduced this year and replace that with an app that gamifies commuting. Points would be awarded based on mode/distance/location and could be redeemed at sponsoring merchants or donated to charity."" Sophie Schmitt ""Households with more than one car should pay a surcharge. We should increase tolls at rush hour. And add a surcharge on Uber/Lyft at rush hour that goes directly to public transportation."" Geoff Foley Family rail discounts ""My husband and I pay a combined total of $756 a month on commuter-rail costs. This does not include parking. We often can't pay the full cost of a monthly pass upfront so we have to pay for 10-day passes, splitting up the cost of our passes through the month. This has caused an extreme financial strain on our family. There are days when we cannot afford to both ride the train to work, so one of us has to either drive in and play the street-meter parking game, or work from home. If the commuter rail offered a discounted monthly pass for families who commute together on the train, this could ease a lot of strain on families, and some might be more inclined to ride the train."" Courtney Landers Telecommuting ""There needs to be better, more supported and incentivized work-from-home policies in all areas of government and the private sector. I understand the importance of face time in meetings, but in this age of technology, combined with an ability to track productivity at home, it's irresponsible to structure the workday for non-essential personnel in such a way that they're fighting Boston traffic (and contributing to Boston's carbon output) just to get to an office space to make phone calls and write e-mails."" Elizabeth Holmgren ""Wait 10 to 20 years until the people in their 30s and 40s now become executives and allow a majority of their employees to work from home. Executives today, who came up in the age of typewriters, desk phones, and water coolers, cannot wrap their minds around the fact that 75 percent of employees today could do their entire job from their couch."" Robbie Vogel Regional planning ""Let's create a new quasi-public state agency that acts as a hub between all of the various modes of transportation available to manage the state's transportation network. This hub would combine walking, bike and scooter rentals, rideshare companies, buses, trains and subways, ferries, and parking garages. Combine this with a user application that allows people to plan their trips and provides an incentive for advance planning. With all this in one place, users would simply enter their destination and when they needed to get there, and the system would figure out the rest, with all services being paid for at a single point."" Chris Trudel ""We need north-south public transportation. The median strips of 128 and 495 should have light rail/bus lines with stations at all the exits. Currently if you want to take a train south to north it is almost impossible. All transportation goes into and out of Boston. But we live in a larger and larger area of hybrid urban/suburban greater Boston. If you live on a spoke you must have a job on that spoke. If not, you are guaranteed an over two-hour round trip anywhere."" Gregory Gonser Bicycling ""I'm 68 years old and commute 30 miles a day by bike. If I can do it, certainly the younger workers can. But we need many more protected bikeways, and businesses need to provide secure bike parking and locker rooms. A visit to Copenhagen or Amsterdam would demonstrate the viability of building infrastructure for bike commuting."" Rick Treitman ""Expand biking infrastructure! So many people I know would love to bike commute, but are afraid to ride in traffic, especially given Boston's aggressive driving culture. And who can blame them?"" Yue ""There are many free parking lots on the bicycle trails leading into downtown. But parking is forbidden after sunset, so one would need to leave work at 3:45 p.m. to bicycle out to the lot to get out in time. Governor Baker's response to requests to extend the parking past sunset: nothing. It is not just success that gives us bad traffic. It is also poor leadership."" ForayChannel Traffic enforcement ""What about actually enforcing our current traffic laws? That would seem to be the least controversial way to make driving much more expensive. I have lived in Boston for 15 years. I can count on one hand the number of times I have seen cars pulled over/ticketed in Boston for running red lights, speeding through a crosswalk when pedestrians are trying to cross, or blocking the box at an intersection. Yet these violations happen every single time I drive or walk anywhere in Boston. I know we are famous for the worst drivers in the country. But that terrible driving is tolerated. If current laws were enforced, driving would be MUCH more expensive. With several $150 tickets per week, maybe some car commuters would see more value in taking the train."" Keely Boyer ""One easy way to help with traffic flow in the city would be to install cameras at lights to ticket those who cause gridlock at major intersections. Tickets would automatically charge drivers and eliminate issues such as profiling or getting ticket quotas met."" Paul McCann Park and ride ""We should have express buses to downtown Boston (and maybe some to Kendall Square and the medical area) from park-and-ride lots at about every other exit on route 128 - and maybe some in other locations between 128 and 495. And the enticement is - the buses aren't free. Passengers GET PAID to take the buses. Everyone loves to get money. Ridership would go through the roof."" Mark Seliber ""I'm amazed at how little parking there is to make public transportation feasible. If there were available parking and monthly contracts that made parking and riding affordable, maybe people would."" Dori Water transportation ""We need to get serious about water transportation. Boston Harbor Now's Inner Harbor Connector concept is a particularly weak swipe at a very promising transit opportunity. In a harbor city with neighborhoods packed into every nook and cranny around a 40-mile shoreline, and with our traffic congestion problems, a four-stop system that serves wealthy communities exclusively at twice the cost of a T fare is a recipe for environmental-justice embarrassment and risks failure for the same reason water transit has failed in the past in Boston: It is planned as a niche service for special interests and not as real urban transit. Let's create water transit that's designed to serve the entire region."" Chris Marchi Commuter bus ""Though there are plans to increase the frequency of commuter-rail service into Boston, a potential solution to address the more immediate need is to offer commuter-bus service to complement the commuter-rail lines. These buses would pick up at the commuter-rail stop and serve as an additional option for commuters currently opting to drive themselves."" Maggie Political gridlock ""It seems the head honchos in this state just don't get it. Governor Charlie Baker, House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo, and State Senate President Karen E. Spilka are all in la la land. It's ridiculous that they get free parking and transportation allowances. How about we charge them market rates for that parking and instead offer a bonus to take public transit?"" mitrefcp5 Right turns ""I grew up and learned to drive in California, where turning right after coming to a full stop at a red light was legal. I was astonished and dismayed when I came to Massachusetts to find that it was not legal. My amazement recurred through the years as measures to legalize right-turn-on-red were repeatedly defeated in the State House. Opponents feared that geezers with walkers, babies in prams, and little Shih Tzus on leashes would be mowed down in crosswalks on a daily basis. Then the impossible happened: After 20-some years a right-turn-on-red law passed! I couldn't believe it! Get the booze! Call the hookers! We are gonna paaaar-TAY. But wait. My celebration was premature. Before the measure became law, they stamped out a million ""NO TURN ON RED"" signs and put them up, well, everywhere. So now you could turn right against a red light except for where you couldn't, which was everywhere. I lived in Cambridge for 36 years. I am now back in California. We have ""NO TURN ON RED"" signs here, but they are located where the view to the left is obstructed. I don't mind those at all. But when the right lane is stacked up unnecessarily at countless intersections all over town, the aggregate effect on slowing traffic must be significant. If I were a Boston politician I'd make some noise about it."" John Troy Tips and comments about the Spotlight series ""Seeing Red"" can be sent to commuting@globe.com.

65,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,"Encore by sea, even in winter",,,"Link to Image EVERETT - Before they hit the card tables or slot machines, visitors who arrive at Encore Boston Harbor on the casino's water shuttle often check in first with dockmaster Jay Larcome. He's offering deals of his own. ""Welcome to Encore Boston Harbor,"" Larcome says as he hands $7 food-and-drink vouchers to a group of women disembarking one of the 35-passenger yachts the casino has been using to ferry in passengers up the Mystic River from Boston. He also hands them a coupon for a free trip back when they're done.","FULL TEXT In a business that places a huge emphasis on first impressions, Encore counts on Larcome, a  66-year-old retired Newburyport police officer, to ensure a smooth entrance for the hundreds of customers who come by sea each day. ""We have a lot of great responses from a lot of guests,"" he says, noting that the boats, which cost more than $1 million each, do most of the heavy lifting. ""Encore spared no expenses on building these boats."" And as the casino enters its first winter - it opened in late June - it will be his job to make sure the boats keep running smoothly even as the ice and snow bear down. The first thing you notice about the dock where Larcome spends much of his time is the view. The facade of the 27-story hotel and casino curves to embrace the waterfront. So if you don't turn your head to look at the giant Exelon power plant nearby, the manicured grounds of the resort might make you forget about the rest of the industrial waterfront. Link to Image Larcome has always been a boat guy. He lived on Plum Island for a long time, and still calls Newburyport home. After retiring from the police force 22 years ago, he spent years in management at clubs including Provincetown Marina and Charlestown Marina. But in all of his years boating in and around Boston, he never explored this part of the Mystic. ""It was a commercial type of thing,"" he says. ""So there was really never much for us to do. This amazes me."" The casino is now a marine destination of its own. In addition to its four MGM Yachts (built just down the shoreline at Boston BoatWorks in Charlestown), Encore also allows boat owners to reserve dock space if they want to navigate there themselves. The industrial heritage of the Mystic is actually a help for the casino as it seeks to keep running the shuttle service year round. Commercial interests like the Exelon plant use icebreakers to keep the travel path clear for shipping, which means the casino's little boats will have no problem slipping through. ""We're not going to be the first ones to break the ice, so to speak,"" Larcome says. The casino expects demand for the shuttle to drop off over the winter. Trips now run from 11:45 a.m. to 11:10 p.m.; in the summer they started at 7 a.m. The shuttles stop at Long Wharf, East Boston, and the World Trade Center. But every $7 ride counts for one less car trip, which is important to Encore operator Wynn Resorts. Under pressure from neighbors and regulators, the company is trying to keep vehicle traffic to a minimum - so far, it appears to have done that. Larcome says he hopes customers will understand that they are not going to be exposed to the elements when they come aboard the shuttles, which are operated for the casino by Bay State Cruise Company. ""I don't think people know the boats are heated,"" he says. The boats are fully enclosed, with seasonal windows in the back that can be opened during the more cheerful summer months. It was warm on a recent afternoon despite the crisp weather outside, and the view of downtown Boston and the North End and Charlestown waterfronts were undiminished. Larcome and the five dock assistants who work for him won't be exposed to the elements either. There is a heated shack (with faux-marble countertops, naturally) where they can wait for the yachts to come in, and Larcome spends a good amount of his time inside Encore, where there is a transportation office. Link to Image But a recent batch of colder temperatures has given him a sense of what's to come as the weather rolls in. When Larcome arrived in freezing temperatures at 5:30 a.m. on a recent day, his staff alerted him to ice coating part of the floating concrete dock, so his first task was to call in maintenance to break it up. Nothing like that would affect service, he says - though extreme weather is an issue even in summer. ""I think the hardest thing is just making sure that we can keep on a timely schedule,"" he says. ""We might have service interrupted if we have a big snow storm.""

68,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,Stocks slump as Trump says trade deal with China can wait,,,"Link to Image Stocks fell broadly Tuesday after President Trump cast doubt over the potential for a trade deal with China this year and threatened to impose tariffs on French goods. The selling knocked the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than 350 points lower and had the S&P 500 on track for its third straight loss as the market continued to give up gains after a strong November rally. Trump said he has ''no deadline'' for a deal and didn't mind waiting until after the 2020 election to make one. Investors had been hoping for a deal this year, or at least enough progress to stave off new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, including smartphones and laptops, scheduled to start Dec. 15.","FULL TEXT Wall Street is also weighing the potential for an expanded series of trade disputes after a month of relative calm. On Tuesday, Trump proposed tariffs on $2.4 billion in French products in retaliation for a tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook. That follows a threat Monday to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum from Argentina and Brazil. Technology stocks led the losses. The sector is highly sensitive to twists in the trade dispute because many of the companies rely on China for sales and supply chains. Apple slumped 2.2% and Intel fell 2.9%. Bank stocks also suffered heavy losses as investors headed for the safety of bonds and pushed yields lower. Banks rely on higher bond yields to charge more lucrative interest rates on mortgages and other loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell sharply to 1.71% from 1.83% late Monday. Bank of America shed 2.3% and Citigroup fell 1.8%. Utilities and real estate companies held up the best as investors shifted money to the safe-play sectors. KEEPING SCORE: The S&P 500 index was down 0.9% as of 2:45 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow fell 344 points, or 1.2%, to 27,439. The index was briefly down 457 points. The Nasdaq fell 0.9%. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell 0.6%. Asian and European markets also fell. DECEMBER DIP? The lack of a trade deal before the year ends could mean the market is in for a turnaround from a strong, record-setting November. The S&P 500 had its best month since June with a 3.4% gain because of cooling trade tensions and optimism that a resolution to the dispute was near. Two days of deflated hopes has already sent the S&P 500 about 2% lower and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has slipped 2.1%. December is a typically solid month for the stock market, with the S&P 500 making gains regularly since the last recession ended in 2009. Last year, though, fears about a recession and rising interest rates hurt the major indexes. METAL MARRIAGE: Cleveland-Cliffs plunged 12.1% after the iron-ore miner said it will pay $1.1 billion for steel maker AK Steel. U.S. steel producers have struggled since the Trump administration put a 25% steel tariff into place last year. Domestic demand has slumped as oil and gas drillers pull back on purchases of steel pipe. The price for hot rolled steel has slid almost 30% this year. AK Steel rose 2.8%. DRESSED FOR SUCCESS: Lands' End vaulted 15.2% after the clothing maker reported surprisingly good fourth-quarter earnings and raised its profit forecast for the year. ECONOMIC WATCH: Wall Street still has a busy week ahead for some key economic gauges following disappointing manufacturing and construction data on Monday. Investors will get a better view of the services sector, which makes up the bulk of the economy, with a November report on Wednesday. Economists expect a very slight drop in growth. Employment data is also on tap this week. On Wednesday, payroll processor ADP will release its latest survey of hiring by private companies. The Labor Department will release its closely watched employment report on Friday.",['ENGLISH'],659,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-MKNKHPAWBII6VKSIQ5Y27TNQEU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001631', 'className': 'STOCK INDEXES'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX001673', 'className': 'TARIFFS & DUTIES'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX000198', 'className': 'BONDS'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX001742', 'className': 'TRADE DISPUTES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk', 'className': 'Trade Agreements'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001741', 'className': 'TRADE DEVELOPMENT'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX000197', 'className': 'BOND MARKETS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX000943', 'className': 'INTEREST RATES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001757', 'className': 'TREASURY SECURITIES'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST00096KI', 'className': 'MORTGAGE RATES'}], 'industry': [{'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001631', 'className': 'STOCK INDEXES'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX000198', 'className': 'BONDS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001455', 'className': 'REAL ESTATE'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N520000CC', 'className': 'BANKING & FINANCE'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0009RX6'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N522292GC', 'className': 'MORTGAGE BANKING & FINANCE'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000A2W7'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX000197', 'className': 'BOND MARKETS'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST000A0Z7', 'className': 'MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES'}, {'score': '63', 'classCode': 'ST000CYWJ', 'className': 'SMARTPHONES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX000943', 'className': 'INTEREST RATES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001757', 'className': 'TREASURY SECURITIES'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST00096KI', 'className': 'MORTGAGE RATES'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC337', 'className': 'ARGENTINA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC338', 'className': 'BRAZIL'}]}"
69,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",POLITICS,,"Kamala Harris ends White House bid, citing lack of funding",,,"Link to Image SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Sen. Kamala Harris told supporters on Tuesday that she was ending her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, an abrupt close to a candidacy that held historic potential. ""I've taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,"" the California Democrat said. ""My campaign for president simply doesn't have the financial resources we need to continue."" A senior campaign aide said Harris made the decision Monday after discussing the path forward with family and other top officials over the Thanksgiving holiday.","Her withdrawal marked a dramatic fall for a candidate who showed extraordinary promise in her bid to become the first black female president. Harris launched her campaign in front of 20,000 people  on a chilly January day in Oakland, California. The first woman and first black attorney general and U.S. senator in California's history, she was widely viewed as a candidate poised to excite the multiracial coalition of voters that sent Barack Obama to the White House. Her departure erodes the diversity of the Democratic field, which is dominated at the moment by a top tier that is white and mostly male. ""She was an important voice in the race, out before others who raised less and were less electable. It's a loss not to have her voice in the race,"" said Aimee Allison, who leads She the People, a group that promotes women of color. Harris ultimately could not craft a message that resonated with voters or secure the money to continue her run. She raised an impressive $12 million in the first three months of her campaign and quickly locked down major endorsements meant to show her dominance in her home state, which offers the biggest delegate haul in the Democratic primary contest. But as the field grew, Harris' fundraising remained flat; she was unable to attract the type of attention being showered on Pete Buttigieg by traditional donors or the grassroots firepower that drove tens of millions of dollars to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. In her note to supporters, Harris lamented the role of money in politics and, without naming them, took a shot at billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, who are funding their presidential bids. ""I'm not a billionaire,"" she said. ""I can't fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete."" Harris suffered from what allies and critics viewed as an inconsistent pitch to voters. Her slogan ""For the people"" referenced her career as a prosecutor, a record that was viewed skeptically by the party's most progressive voters. Through the summer, she focused on pocketbook issues and her ""3 a.m. agenda,"" a message that never seemed to resonate with voters. By the fall, she had returned to her courtroom roots with the refrain that ""justice is on the ballot,"" both a cry for economic and social justice as well as her call that she could ""prosecute the case"" against a ""criminal"" president. At times, she was tripped up by confusing policy positions; particularly on health care. After suggesting she would eliminate private insurance in favor of a fully government-run system, Harris eventually rolled out a health care plan that preserves a role for private insurance. Stumbles, often of the campaign's making, continued to dog Harris into the winter, stymieing her ability to capitalize on solid moments. Harris kicked off November with a well-received speech at a massive Iowa dinner, just a day after her campaign announced it would fire staff at its Baltimore headquarters and was moving some people from other early states to Iowa. Her message was regularly overshadowed by campaign aides and allies sharing grievances with the news media. Several top aides decamped for other campaigns, one leaving a blistering resignation letter. ""Because we have refused to confront our mistakes, foster an environment of critical thinking and honest feedback, or trust the expertise of talented staff, we find ourselves making the same unforced errors over and over,"" Kelly Mehlenbacher wrote in her letter, obtained by The New York Times. Mehlenbacher now works for businessman Bloomberg's campaign. With Harris' exit, 15 Democrats remain in the race for the nomination. Several praised her on Tuesday. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a memorable debate stage tussle with Harris this summer, called the senator a ""solid person, loaded with talent."" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders commended Harris for ""running a spirited and issue-oriented campaign."" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, one of two black candidates still in the campaign, called Harris a ""trailblazer."" Harris anchored her campaign in the powerful legacy of pioneering African Americans. Her campaign launch on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday included a nod to Shirley Chisholm, the New York congresswoman who sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination 47 years ago earlier. One of her first stops as a candidate was to Howard University, the historically black college that she attended as an undergraduate. She spent much of her early campaign focusing on South Carolina, which hosts the first Southern primary and has a significant African American population. But Harris struggled to chip away at Biden's deep advantage with black voters who are critical to winning the Democratic nomination. Harris and her aides believe she faced an uphill battle - and unfair expectations for perfection - from the start as a woman of color. Her campaign speech included a line about what Harris called the ""donkey in the room,"" a reference to the thought that Americans wouldn't elect a woman of color. Harris often suggested it was criticism she faced in her other campaigns - all of which she won. Her departure from the presidential race marks her first defeat as a political candidate. ___ Associated Press writers Steve Peoples in New York and Bill Barrow in Mason City, Iowa, contributed to this report.",['ENGLISH'],1005,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-SYKN6DHPGFD2TCLVCSUJHKGNPM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCX', 'className': 'US DEMOCRATIC PARTY'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000245', 'className': 'CAMPAIGN FINANCE'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000246', 'className': 'CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001342', 'className': 'POLITICAL CANDIDATES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001851', 'className': 'WOMEN'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009TA3', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DA1D', 'className': 'US CONGRESS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009TRZ', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001371', 'className': 'HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001377', 'className': 'PRIMARY ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000769', 'className': 'FUNDRAISING'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001444', 'className': 'RACE & ETHNICITY'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001822', 'className': 'WEALTHY PEOPLE'}, {'score': '65', 'classCode': 'ST0009XS5', 'className': 'THANKSGIVING'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DANS', 'className': 'ELIZABETH WARREN'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DEDM', 'className': 'KAMALA HARRIS'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DNV1', 'className': 'PETE BUTTIGIEG'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DFNN', 'className': 'TOM STEYER'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJP', 'className': 'BARACK OBAMA'}, {'score': '54', 'classCode': 'PE0009UB9', 'className': 'BERNIE SANDERS'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX542', 'className': 'SACRAMENTO, CA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST0009UE1', 'className': 'SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA'}, {'score': '57', 'classCode': 'GX486', 'className': 'OAKLAND, CA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

The indicted officers face a combined total 236 counts, including charges of assault and participating in a criminal gang, Mosby said. Maryland corrections secretary Robert Green said all the indicted officers have been on administrative leave since 2018, when the state Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services began investigating the allegations. ""This case represents our strong effort to root out people who don't belong in the field where public safety and rehabilitation is the mission,"" Green told reporters. ""This is a disturbing case, but it does not represent nor should it cast a shadow on the commitment and integrity of the exceptional correctional professionals in this department."" Mosby said 21 of the 25 indicted officers were taken into custody on Tuesday. All of them were members of a tactical unit, with a paramilitary command structure, operating inside four detention facilities in Baltimore. Mosby said the officers used violence and intimidation to ""maintain its dominance and its operational territory"" inside the jails.

72,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",POLITICS,,Trump looks beyond DOJ watchdog's Russia report,,,"Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he expected an upcoming watchdog report to be ""devastating"" on the origins of the Russia investigation that dogged his presidency for nearly two years, but also suggested Americans should really be more interested in the findings of a federal prosecutor appointed to do a similar probe. Speaking to reporters in London, Trump said the ""big report"" on the Russia investigation will come from U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was appointed by Attorney General William Barr in July to lead the inquiry into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It's not clear when that probe will be completed.","But the Justice Department's inspector general is scheduled to release a report on Monday on the early stages of the FBI's Russia investigation. The president's comments could mean that Monday's report, centered in part on the use of a secret surveillance warrant to monitor the communications of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, wouldn't be a full-throated confirmation of his allegations that the Russia probe was a politically-motivated ""witch hunt."" Republicans could instead play up that Durham's inquiry is far from done, and could uncover wrongdoing that the inspector general wasn't examining. ""I do think the big report to wait for is going to be the Durham report,"" Trump said. ""That's the one that people are really waiting for."" Trump's remarks come a day after The Washington Post  reported that Barr told associates he disagrees with a finding from the inspector general's upcoming report that the FBI was justified in July 2016 in opening a counterintelligence investigation into members of the Trump campaign. The newspaper, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, reported that Barr had not been swayed by Inspector General Michael Horowitz's rationale for concluding that the FBI had a good enough reason to open the investigation that would become the special counsel's probe. While the president said the inspector general's report was also very important, and that he's heard ""it's devastating,"" the watchdog is limited in what he was examining, and Durham has a wider investigative scope. The inspector general does not have the power to compel former employees to be interviewed. Durham is conducting a criminal investigation examining what led the U.S. to open a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign and the roles that various countries played in the U.S. probe. He is also investigating whether the surveillance methods and intelligence gathering methods used during the investigation were legal and appropriate. Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, is a career prosecutor who has led investigations into the FBI's cozy relationship with Boston mobsters like James ""Whitey"" Bulger and the CIA's use of tough interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects. The FBI's counterintelligence investigation later morphed into special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Mueller concluded that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election, but his investigation didn't find sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia. Mueller also examined 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice and has pointedly said he could not exonerate the president. The inspector general uncovered that an FBI lawyer is suspected of altering a document related to surveillance of Page, according to a person familiar with the case who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke to AP only on the condition of anonymity. The inspector general cannot bring criminal charges, but can make referrals to federal prosecutors if potential crimes are uncovered. Trump and his supporters are likely to seize on any findings of mistakes or bad judgment in the report to support their claims of a biased investigation. Supporters of the FBI, meanwhile, are likely to hold up as vindication any findings that the investigation was done by the book, or free of political considerations. The Justice Department has no plan to submit a formal rebuttal as part of the inspector general's report, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations surrounding the report. The attorney general has taken a hands-on role in leading the Durham investigation and has traveled overseas with Durham for personal meetings with foreign law enforcement officials, some of which were initiated by Trump. The president has asked the Australian prime minister and other foreign leaders to help Barr with the Durham investigation. Trump's interactions with foreign leaders - and Barr's role in those discussions - have received heightened scrutiny as the House conducts an impeachment inquiry into the president's efforts to press the leader of Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden at the same time as military aid was being withheld from the country. The report from the intelligence committee on the House impeachment inquiry was made public Tuesday. ___ Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.",['ENGLISH'],870,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-IKZYYJEVCZEOHMB4RAIICRC6F4,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'N922120CC', 'className': 'LAW ENFORCEMENT'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0008X5W', 'className': 'SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000106', 'className': 'APPOINTMENTS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX000128', 'className': 'ATTORNEYS GENERAL'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000D4JV', 'className': 'CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST000DJX1', 'className': 'FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST00097CJ', 'className': 'JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N922130TM', 'className': 'PUBLIC PROSECUTORS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX000938', 'className': 'INTELLIGENCE SERVICES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DKTF', 'className': 'SURVEILLANCE'}], 'industry': [{'score': '72', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DNE3', 'className': 'WILLIAM BARR'}, {'score': '55', 'classCode': 'PE000DB9Q', 'className': 'ROBERT MUELLER'}], 'city': [{'score': '55', 'classCode': 'GX106', 'className': 'LONDON, ENGLAND'}], 'country': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"

(AP) - Federal regulators have fined the nation's largest public utility $145,000 for submitting incomplete and inaccurate information on a backup system at its Watts Bar Nuclear Plant.","The Nuclear Regulatory Commission notified the Tennessee Valley Authority of the proposed fine regarding the Spring City, Tennessee plant in a Nov. 19 letter. The utility, in turn, says it has taken corrective action, adding that the backup configuration was never used. According to the commission, the incorrect and inaccurate information that the utility provided from July 2010 to January 2015 didn't result in consequences, but it was used in part to approve reactor licensing requests at the plant. The commission has said the backup setup would've been inadequate to power safety equipment in certain accident scenarios. ""Had TVA provided complete and accurate information during the NRC inspection, and as part of approval of license amendments, the NRC would have conducted significant additional inspection and/or inquiry, or reached different regulatory conclusions,"" the commission's letter states. TVA spokesman Jim Hopson said the federal utility inadvertently used the inaccurate information to develop a configuration that would have been rarely used. ""This did not affect public safety, did not impact daily operations, and this plant alignment was never used,"" Hopson said in a statement. ""TVA has completed an updated safety analysis and is providing the accurate and complete documentation to the NRC.""

74,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,All-America Watch: Championship weekend's best matchups,,,Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Only the best of the best get to play this weekend in college football. Championship weekend crowns the winner of 10 Bowl Subdivision conferences and matches up some big-time players. A look at some of the potential All-Americans who will be matching up in major college football's biggest trophy games. The AP All-America team presented by Regions Bank will be announced Dec. 16. American Athletic Conference,"No. 21 Cincinnati at No. 16 Memphis Ahmad Gardner, CB, Cincinnati vs. Antonio Gibson, WR, Memphis. Gardner is a freshman who has quickly developed into a lock-down corner. He has returned two of his three interceptions for touchdowns. Gibson is a versatile playmaker. The senior is the Tigers' second-leading receiver, averaging 20.8 yards per catch with seven touchdowns and has also run for 233 yards and three scores on 20 carries. Atlantic Coast Conference No. 22 Virginia vs. No. 3 Clemson Bryce Perkins, QB, Virginia vs. Isaiah Simmons, LB, Clemson To be realistic, Perkins won't be making many All-America teams with so many terrific quarterbacks around the country. But he is one of the most dynamic players in the country, carrying the Cavaliers' offense (303 yards per game in total offense, tops in the ACC). Simmons is one of the most versatile defenders in the country, a hybrid who can line up all over the field. He has 14 tackles for loss. Big 12 No. 8 Baylor vs. No. 6 Oklahoma Bravvion Roy, DT, Baylor vs. Creed Humphrey, C, Oklahoma The 333-pound Roy clogs the middle for the Big 12's top defense (4.77 yard per play) and has 10½ tackles for loss. Humphrey might be the best center in the country, helping pave the way for the Sooners' running game, which is No. 1 in the Big 12 at 260 yards per game. Big Ten No. 10 Wisconsin vs. No. 2 Ohio State Chris Orr, LB, Wisconsin vs. J.K. Dobbins, RB, Ohio State Orr is an active linebacker with 13.5 tackles for loss and two fumbles forced. The Badgers stingy defense has allowed just seven rushing touchdowns. Dobbins is on tear lately, with 368 yards rushing in the last two games against Penn State and Michigan. He also had 163 on 20 carries in the first meeting against Wisconsin. Conference USA UAB at Florida Atlantic Garrett Marino, DL, UAB vs. Harrison Bryant, TE, Florida Atlantic Ok, ok. It's not likely a 290-pound interior defensive lineman and 240-pound pass catching tight end will be bumping into each other much Saturday. But these are the best players on each team. Bryant is a legit All-America candidate with 61 catches for 965 yards and six scores, Marino has 12.5 tackles for loss for what has been far and away C-USA's best defense. Mid-America Conference Miami (Ohio) vs. Central Michigan Travion Banks, CB, Miami (Ohio) vs. JaCorey Sullivan, WR, Central Michigan Banks has been one of the best defensive players in the MAC, with four interceptions and five other passes broken up. Sullivan is Central Michigan's big-play receiver, averaging 15.5 yard per catch. Banks could also see a lot of Kalil Pimpleton, who leads the MAC in catches with 73. Mountain West Hawaii vs. Boise State Cedric Byrd II, WR, Hawaii vs. Curtis Weaver, DE, Boise State Another one where the two won't go head-to-head, but if you're looking for All-America contenders, these are the guys. Byrd is first in the Mountain West in catches with 91 and third in receiving yards with 1,049 and 10 touchdowns. Weaver leads the conference in sacks with 13.5 and is a leading contender for Mountain West defensive player of the year. Pac-12 No. 14 Oregon vs. No. 5 Utah Penei Sewell, OT, Oregon vs. Bradley Anae, DE, Utah Big-time matchup. Sewell is on the short list of best offensive lineman in the country. The sophomore has the size and athleticism of a future top NFL draft pick. Anae is the best pass rusher (12.5 sacks) on the Pac-12's best defense. Across the line, the matchup of Oregon's offense and Utah's defense should be nasty fight between a bunch of a big, talented players. Southeastern Conference No. 4 Georgia vs. No. 1 LSU Eric Stokes, CB, Georgia vs. Ja'Marr Chase, WR, LSU The whole Georgia defense vs. LSU offense should be terrific. The Bulldogs are near the top in most defensive categories and the Tigers are lighting up scoreboards with Heisman Trophy front-runner Joe Burrow at quarterback. Stokes is Georgia's top corner. Chase is the nation's leading receiver, averaging 132.5 yards per game and 20.8 per catch, with 17 touchdowns. Sun Belt Louisiana at Appalachian State Kevin Dotson, OG, Louisiana vs. E.J. Scott, NT, Appalachian State Dotson is a powerful run blocker, leading the way for a run-heavy offense that averages 274.2 yards per game. Other Appalachian State players get more stats, but the 275-pound Scott is an undersized disruptor in the middle who frees up his teammates. ___ More AP college football: https://apnews.com/APTop25CollegeFootballPoll and            https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and            https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",['ENGLISH'],827,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-MMJBJVWQHZAG7BQ3EAU6WRSJVU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Business & Corporate Compliance', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000081', 'className': 'AMERICAN FOOTBALL'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000365', 'className': 'CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001452', 'className': 'RANKINGS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX000126', 'className': 'ATHLETES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '91', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}], 'city': [{'score': '87', 'classCode': 'GX615', 'className': 'CINCINNATI, OH, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GS151', 'className': 'OHIO, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
75,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",METRO,,Boston Center for the Arts delays residency program by a year,,,"Responding to broad criticism over its plan to evict dozens of longtime artists, the Boston Center for the Arts has proposed delaying a new residency program by a year and offering at least 25 percent of its studios to artists who currently rent space in its sprawling South End complex.","FULL TEXT The center's leaders on Monday told artists who rent heavily subsidized workspace on Tremont Street that the residency program will not begin until June 2021, and that 10 spaces would be set aside for applicants among the approximately 40 artists who work there now, many of them for decades. The artists had been told in September that they would have to vacate the city-owned building by May 1, 2020, and reapply with no guarantees for admission to the residency program. Called Studio 551, the program is designed to attract a wide array of visual and performing artists for six months to six years. Many current tenants complained at the time that they had not been involved in the planning, which had been under way for a year, and that they did not know any specifics until they were unveiled at a meeting that was ostensibly called to celebrate the BCA's 50th anniversary. Gregory Ruffer, who led the meeting as BCA director, resigned in October following allegations that he had sent sexually suggestive emails a decade ago to a young man who studied under him in Florida. Emily Day, who was named co-director after Ruffer's departure, told the Globe that the new proposals were drafted with the intent of having ""a more transparent and collaborative process."" Day said that the new proposal evolved after discussions with the Massachusetts Cultural Council, the neighborhood association, and the artists at 551 Tremont St., which the center leases for $1 through a 99-year agreement with the city. ""We have a duty to make this a more public process,"" Day said. ""We can look back and wish we could have done this differently, but it's important now to do the right thing."" In a statement, a large group of the artists said that ""both parties agreed to having additional meetings ... in order to further discuss and resolve our differences, so that a truly constructive, equitable, and forward-looking plan might be devised for Studio 551."" The artists said that a mediator will be sought to help resolve differences between the tenants and the center. Day said the selection process would have two phases: Current tenants would submit applications in spring 2020, followed in the autumn by applications from new, prospective artists-in-residency. The candidates would be judged by other artists from many disciplines, Day said. Some studio space might be set aside for low-income candidates and Boston residents who cannot afford workspace in an increasingly expensive city.

(AP) - John Hynes paid the price for the New Jersey Devils failing to deliver on the high expectations created by having three No. 1 overall draft picks in the lineup.","Hynes was fired as coach Tuesday after a 9-13-4 start that left the team in last place in the Metropolitan Division and with the NHL's second-worst record. General manager Ray Shero announced the move roughly 20 minutes before Hynes was schedule to speak to the media before the Devils' game against the Las Vegas Golden Knights. Hynes had been coach for four-plus seasons. Shero said assistant Alain Nasreddine would become the interim coach and Peter Horachek, a pro scout for the team, would join the coaching staff as an assistant. Shero was expected to address the media before the game. The dismissal comes a day after the Devils were ripped by the Buffalo Sabres 7-1. That game followed a 4-0 loss at home to the rival New York Rangers on Saturday. The Devils had high hopes entering the season after drafting Jack Hughes with the No. 1 overall pick just two years after taking Nico Hischier with the No. 1 pick. The other first overall pick on the roster is Taylor Hall, who won the league MVP award in 2018 after leading New Jersey to the playoffs. The Devils are the third team to change coaches this season. Toronto fired Mike Babcock two weeks ago and Calgary parted way with Bill Peters last week. Hynes, who was hired by the Devils in June 2015, had a 150-159-45 record in 354 career regular-season games. When the New Jersey made the postseason in '18, it was the first time since going to the Stanley Cup Final in 2012. Hynes ranks second in team history in games coached, wins and points (345). ""John played an integral role in the development of this team in establishing a foundation for our future and we are grateful for his commitment, passion and unmatched work ethic,"" Shero said in a statement. ""John is a respected leader, developer of talent and friend which makes this decision difficult. We are a team who values and takes pride in accountability to the results we produce. ""We are collectively disappointed in our performance on the ice, and believe changes were needed starting with our head coach,"" Shero added. I have been consistent in my desire to build something here in New Jersey that earns the respect of teams throughout the league and pride in our fans. That is not where we were heading and for me to tolerate anything less was not acceptable."" Nasreddine played for six different NHL organizations during his 15-year pro career with Chicago, Edmonton, Florida, Montreal, the Islanders and Pittsburgh. Horachek was a longtime assistant coach for the Nashville Predators, as well as interim head coach of the Florida Panthers and the Maple Leafs.

81,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",NATION,,Black victims underrepresented in named violent crime laws,,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image CLEVELAND (AP) - The slayings of Reagan Tokes and Alianna DeFreeze had much in common. Both were abducted, raped and killed in Ohio in 2017. Tokes was a 21-year-old college student, DeFreeze a 14-year-old seventh grader. Both their killers were previously convicted sex offenders. Yet only one victim got a law with her name on it - Tokes, who was white.","That disparity in so-called namesake laws represents a national trend: White crime victims are much more likely to get crime bills named after them than black victims. An Associated Press analysis found that more than eight in 10 stand-alone laws named for victims of violent crime since 1990 honored white victims or groups of victims that included at least one white person. Only 6 percent were named for black victims. Namesake laws have been a popular way for lawmakers to simultaneously recognize victims of horrific crimes and enact tough-on-crime laws, and many have become common parlance in the national criminal justice discussion. AMBER Alerts that warn the public to look out for a missing child are named for Amber Hagerman, a white 9-year-old from Texas who was killed after being abducted while riding her bike with her brother. Sex offender registries and notification systems were set up under federal and state laws named for 6-year-old Adam Walsh, 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling and 7-year-old Megan Kanka, all white children abducted and killed by sex offenders. Racial disparity in such laws has left black victims such as DeFreeze underrepresented. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, black young people in her age range - from 12 to 19 - experience violent crime at significantly higher rates than their white peers, including being five times more likely to be victims of homicide. The Tokes and DeFreeze murders have led some Ohio lawmakers to question whether racial preference is at work in the naming of crime laws. The issue is back before lawmakers in at least three separate bills that are expected to see more debate this month. DeFreeze's mother, Donnesha Cooper, said it was devastating when a bill that would have created an ""Alianna's Alert"" failed to pass last year. She wanted a bill named for her daughter that would require schools to inform parents within an hour if a child without an excuse didn't show up for class. The family and a pending wrongful death lawsuit allege that's something her school, E Prep & Village Prep Woodland Hills, a Cleveland charter school, did not do in DeFreeze's case. The school is contesting the suit's allegations; its attorney declined comment. Her daughter was abducted near a city bus stop while on her way to early morning tutoring. Cooper didn't learn the teen was missing until 4 p.m., when she says it was too late to save her. ""It was hurtful, because I thought that the bill having her name on it would be a part of her legacy. ... So that everybody would know that this bill was passed for the sake of future lives - and my daughter lost her life in the process, for a change to happen,"" she said. ""And they didn't even put her name on it."" Instead, language creating the alert was watered down and tucked quietly into an unrelated piece of legislation. ""Having a law named for a white victim versus an African American victim or a Hispanic victim does not inherently mean that people of all races don't benefit from that legislation,"" said Teresa Kulig, an assistant criminology professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. ""But it is kind of an important indication of who is highlighted in these laws."" Kulig co-authored a 2016 report that found that 86% of 51 laws named for victims of murder, rape and other violent crimes from 1990 to 2016 were named for white victims. The AP analysis, which included laws from that study as well as bills enacted since 2016, found the pattern continued largely unchanged. Exceptions included the Lavinia Masters Act, aimed at eliminating Texas' rape kit backlog, and Tennessee's JaJuan Latham Act, which toughened criminal penalties in drive-by shootings. Both laws were named for black victims and passed just this year. Kulig said named laws generally spring from unspeakable tragedies - abductions, murders, domestic assaults, cases of child abuse - and studying racial disparities isn't intended to diminish the pain of the mostly white families such laws honor. Ohio Rep. Kristin Boggs, a Columbus Democrat who is white, sponsored the Reagan Tokes Act. She said the case exposed flaws in Ohio's parole system that demanded a legislative response. Tokes, a psychology major at Ohio State University, was kidnapped after leaving her restaurant job, raped and killed. Tokes' killer had been released from prison two months earlier and was wearing an electronic monitor at the time. While she acknowledged some implicit racial bias no doubt exists in the Ohio Legislature, Boggs said she doesn't believe her colleagues are judging namesake bills based on victims' ethnicity. The Tokes legislation, she said, was propelled by passionate lobbying by the family, which declined an AP request for comment through their attorney, and intense media attention to the case. Opponents of namesake laws see an added twist: The new criminal penalties imposed by namesake bills named largely for whites fall disproportionately on blacks. ___ Associated Press news researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report. ___ Follow Julie Carr Smyth at http://www.twitter.com/jcarrsmyth",['ENGLISH'],924,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-X34SK4A5DJCU5M7RUV6X2NOG3A,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001932', 'className': 'CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REE3RUI5RUNDMTgyNDU3Rjk2QUMwOTVBOUI1NDNFOTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk', 'className': 'Criminal Offenses'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OEI3OTJEMzAyQUJCNDc1OEI2QkQyQzVDQTRDNUEwNTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Kidnapping'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkQwRTk5MUFBNjMxNDJGQUJGMDJBNjIzOTZEMUZBQTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjgwNUY4MjJCMTg5NDgzRUJBMDQwNkM4NkUyNTJBMEY', 'className': 'Sex Crimes'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTBBQjYwQkYwN0ZGNDQzOTlEMjIyRDEyMkE1RTAwRjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFENzYyRUI3RjFENEUwOEIyN0U0NEZBQjE5RjExMzk', 'className': 'Abuse of Children'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001806', 'className': 'VIOLENT CRIME'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEU0RkE1OUQwNUQwNDgxODhEODZCMjkzOTg3NThBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0', 'className': 'Criminal Law & Procedure'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX001444', 'className': 'RACE & ETHNICITY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEY2MzZGQUY0QTIzNDk2MjkxNEQwRDBCQzc1M0RFNTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REE3RUI5RUNDMTgyNDU3Rjk2QUMwOTVBOUI1NDNFOTY', 'className': 'Homicide, Manslaughter & Murder'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ5ODg4NkU4QzRDNDhFMDkzQTg0QkMxMjVBMzQyRjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEY2MzZGQUY0QTIzNDk2MjkxNEQwRDBCQzc1M0RFNTY', 'className': 'Murder'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001803', 'className': 'VICTIMS RIGHTS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA', 'className': 'State & Territorial Governments'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST00097CJ', 'className': 'JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'ST0008XMR', 'className': 'LAW & LEGAL SYSTEM'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001759', 'className': 'TRENDS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DNEU', 'className': 'MISSING PERSON ALERTS'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'ST000DNVL', 'className': 'OFFENDER REGISTRIES'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000A4JU', 'className': 'CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX001627', 'className': 'STATISTICS'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX607', 'className': 'CLEVELAND, OH, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GS151', 'className': 'OHIO, USA'}]}"
82,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",METRO,,'All hands on deck' to plow snow in communities that saw more than two feet of snow in 48 hours,,,"In some communities in Massachusetts where the first major snowfall of the season generated more than two feet of snow in 48 hours, it was all hands on deck to plow the streets, officials said. Winchendon and Royalston in northern Worcester County were hit the hardest, according to the National Weather Service. They received over            two feet of snow from the start of the storm Sunday afternoon to Tuesday afternoon. Albert Gallant, the director of public works of Winchendon, said the town has received 27 inches of snow since 2 p.m. on Sunday.","FULL TEXT ""It's just hard to keep up with that kind of amount,"" he said. ""It's not the season or the earliness, it's the amount in such a short period of time."" Taming the overwhelming amount of snow was made more challenging when four of the town's 12 snow plows broke Monday night due to ""unexpected mechanical issues,"" Gallant said. ""It slows everything down because it takes about five hours to do the town once,"" he said. ""We have 134 miles of road."" The snow was still falling in Winchendon Tuesday morning, making roads that have already been cleared look like they hadn't been touched by a snow plow, Gallant said. The snow plow drivers have been working in rotations around the clock for the past 48 hours, he said. Despite the challenges, Gallant said most Winchendon citizens have been positive and understanding. ""They know it's hard to deal with this much this fast,"" he said. Keith Newton, the superintendent of the Department of Public Works in Royalston, estimated that the town received about 26 inches. He said the most prominent challenge was the moisture content of the snow. The flakes freezed as soon as they hit the ground, creating a thin layer of ice that is dangerous and hard to plow. Newton said receiving this amount of snow is not an unusual event for the town, but the two back-to-back snowfalls on Sunday and Monday night was hard to plan for. ""Because I've been here all my life, no this is not an usual event,"" he said. ""People that live here are really well adjusted to it. They took it in stride."" Nicolas Bosonetto, the commissioner of public works in Fitchburg, was driving a snow plow himself Tuesday morning. He said the town is ""all hands on deck"" to make sure the 220 miles of road in the city remain clear. Many other departments were pitching in to help, using every plow they could find. ""If anything has a plow on it, it's out there,"" he said. Bosonetto said the town has received about 20 inches since 1 p.m. Sunday, and that snow plow drivers have been working nonstop for the past two days. The city was prepared for the foot of snow forecasted to hit Sunday night, but the additional 10 inches over the past day were a bit of a surprise as the forecast only called for three additional inches, Bosonetto said. The fluctuating temperatures in Fitchburg have made plowing the roads even more challenging as the snow melts and re-freezes, Bosonetto said. ""This is a heavy amount for the first snow,"" he said. ""Usually we ease into it."" Duane Pease, the town administrator of Middlefield, also said that the amount of snow from the second wave of the storm caught them a bit by surprise. But, despite getting about 20 inches of snow from the storm, the roads were mostly clear as of early Tuesday afternoon, he said. The town's three-person plowing crew worked overnight Monday to ensure that roads were usable for the morning commute. New Bedford saw around 8 inches of snow as of Tuesday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Police Lieutenant Nathaniel Rodriguez encouraged those driving to make sure to clean the snow and ice off their car before getting on the road. ""That even goes for snow on top of your vehicle,"" he said. ""That can slide down onto your windshield and essentially make you blind and could cause an accident, and ... the wind can take it back onto vehicle behind you.""

83,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",SPORTS,,Undersized Marquette star Howard finding ways to dominate,,,"Link to Image Link to Image LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) - Markus Howard continues to find ways to dominate basketball games despite his undersized stature. The 5-foot-11 Marquette preseason All-American and reigning Big East player of the year leads the nation in scoring at 26 points a game. ""We need Markus to be the player and the star he is. It makes everyone better,"" said Golden Eagles coach Steve Wojciechowski. ""He gives us a swagger. He gives us a confidence when he's doing his thing.""","He did his thing at Orlando Invitational. Howard scored 91 points on the first two days of the tournament, making a dazzling array of step-back 3-pointers and seemingly blowing past befuddled defenders at will when he chose to drive to the basket for a closer look. He led Marquette to the championship game, where Howard and the Golden Eagles were derailed by third-ranked Maryland. But during their run, Howard became the first Big East player to ever have back-to-back 40-point games, including a 51-point outburst against Southern California in the semifinals. ""Just another incredible performance,"" said Wojciechowski, who watched the senior from Chandler, Arizona go for 40 the previous night against Davidson. Howard was the last player to leave the court after his impressive outing, pausing to pose for pictures before cheerfully plowing through a pack of young Golden Eagles fans chanting his name. It was the third 50-point game of Howard's career. He also joined Mississippi's Johnny Neumann and LSU's Pete Maravich and Bob Pettit as the only players in a major conference to score at least 40 on consecutive days. ""I don't really pay too much attention to that. Whatever comes is truly a blessing,"" Howard said of the milestones. ""I'm so thankful to be in the position I am, having teammates and coaches I have who let me have the freedom to be who I am and comfortable with who I am."" A second-team All-American last season when he led Marquette to the NCAA Tournament, Howard enters Wednesday night's home game against Jacksonville as the nation's top scorer at 26 per game. He was averaging 29.3 before Maryland overwhelmed the Golden Eagles 84-63 in the Orlando Invitational final, limiting Howard to six points on 1 for 12 shooting, including 0 of 6 on 3-point attempts. The Terrapins made a concerted effort to keep the ball out of Howard's hands, a task 6-foot-5 Darryl Morsell took to heart. And when Maryland's best defender wasn't blanketing the Marquette star, 6-foot-6 Aaron Wiggins made things just as difficult for Howard. ""Our goal was just to make it tough,"" Morsell said. ""Contest every shot, just try to get physical."" It wasn't anything out of the ordinary for Howard. Wojciechowski noted Howard has faced nearly every type of defense imaginable during his career. He's been held to single digits seven times over the past two-plus seasons, but he's always bounced back. ""The fact people defend Markus hard is not new. He's Big East player of the year. He's an All-American last year,"" the coach said. ""Teams have gone out to stop him. We have to learn, re-learn with this group, how to figure that out."" Howard has 51 career games of 20-plus points, 20 with 30 or more and six of at least 40. He has no intentions of slowing down as he approaches another milestone he'll share with his brother, Jordan, who played at Central Arkansas from 2015-18 and was Southland Conference player of the year as a senior. As a duo, the Howards have scored 4,661 points. The only other combo of brothers that's scored more is Seth and Stephen Curry, who finished their NCAA careers with 4,736. ""My teammates give me supreme confidence. If they tell me to keep going, I'm going to keep going. I'm never going to stop. That's kind of the mentality I've had as a scorer,"" Howard said. ""No matter what's being thrown at me, I'm going to continue to come at you. Just continue to be aggressive and play with a chip on my shoulder."" Turns out, what's good for Howard is also good for the Golden Eagles, who feed off his energy. ""I think if I don't show that it definitely changes our team a lot,"" Howard said. ""When I play with a certain swagger and confidence, different guys are able to play with that same kind of edge. I think it's good for our whole team because the best comes out of our team when everybody's playing that way."" ___ More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/collegebasketball and            https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",['ENGLISH'],738,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-7LHMASUD4FD5JAUOKOFZDE6QZ4,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000126', 'className': 'ATHLETES'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'STX000171', 'className': 'BASKETBALL'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'STX001452', 'className': 'RANKINGS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST0009IRB', 'className': 'SPORTS AWARDS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}], 'city': [{'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GX604', 'className': 'JACKSONVILLE, FL, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '87', 'classCode': 'GS136', 'className': 'MARYLAND, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS118', 'className': 'ARIZONA, USA'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GS125', 'className': 'FLORIDA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}]}"
84,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,Google co-founders step down as execs of parent Alphabet,,,"Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The co-founders of Google are stepping down as executives of its parent company, Alphabet, ending a remarkable two decades during which Larry Page and Sergey Brin shaped a startup born in a Silicon Valley garage into one of the world's largest, most powerful - and, increasingly, most feared - firms in the world. Sundar Pichai, who has been leading Google as CEO for more than four years, will stay in his role and also become CEO of Alphabet.","Page was Alphabet's CEO, while Brin was its president. The president's role at Alphabet is not being filled. Both founders promised they plan to stay actively involved as board members and shareholders and lauded Pichai for his leadership of Google. Page and Brin, in announcing the news Tuesday, said the company has ""evolved and matured"" in the two decades since its founding. ""Today, in 2019, if the company was a person, it would be a young adult of 21 and it would be time to leave the roost,"" they said. Alphabet - an umbrella corporation that the two created in 2015 - still boasts Google as its central fixture and key moneymaker. But it's also made up of what are known as ""other bets,"" or longshot projects. That includes drone company Wing and self-driving car firm Waymo. Page and Brin both have been noticeably absent from Google events in the past year. Both stopped making appearances at the weekly question-and-answer sessions with employees, and Page didn't attend this summer's Alphabet shareholders meeting even though he was still in the CEO role. Alphabet has been positioning Pichai as the de facto leader for quite some time - making him the top executive voice at shareholders meetings, on earnings call and as a spokesman at congressional hearings. Pichai, 47, has worked at the company for 15 years, serving as a leader in projects to build the company's Chrome browser and overseeing Android operating system. Pichai, who has an engineering background, took over as the head of Google's products before being promoted to CEO when Alphabet was created. Pichai is known as a soft-spoken and respected manager. Longtime tech analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies said that for all intents and purposes, Pichai has been the public face and the most instrumental person inside Google for the past few years. ""The most interesting question to me - does Sundar as CEO of Alphabet keep the day-to-day role he's had in overseeing all of Google's activities?"" he said. So far, the company has shown no signs that it intends to replace Sundar at Google. But Bajarin said that might make sense, given that Pichai will have so much on his plate as CEO of the overall business, including regulatory pressures from the U.S. and Europe. Google is facing strong pushback from privacy groups, which are concerned about the personal information that Google has collected on its users, mostly to target advertising. Google also faces complaints that it abuses its dominance in search and online advertising to push out rivals. Google is the subject of antitrust inquiries from Congress, the Department of Justice and a contingency of states in the U.S. and from European authorities. The company has also faced harsh criticism about the material on its sites - and was slapped with a $170 million fine because its video streaming site YouTube improperly collected personal data on children without their parents' consent. In the short term, Bajarin doesn't expect much to change at the company. And if anything does, it will be due to government regulation - not the executive shuffle. ""This is kind of a natural flow of the two founders eventually stepping back completely,"" Bajarin said. ""We have seen that over and over in Silicon Valley."" As for Page and Brin, Bajarin added, ""keep in mind, they are not losing their title as billionaires, but they are changing their roles."" Brin and Page still hold more than 50% voting shares of Alphabet. According to a regulatory filing in April, Page holds 42.9% of the company's Class B shares and 26.1% of its voting power. Brin holds 41.3% of the Class B shares and 25.2% of the voting power. Google has nearly doubled its headcount since Pichai took over as chief executive, growing from a company of 59,000 employees to 114,000 now. Google's stock increased less than 1% in after-hours trading after the news was announced. Brin and Page met as Stanford University graduate students in 1995 and started the company soon after. What started as a way to catalog the growing internet has now become one of the most powerful companies in the world. Google dominates online search and digital advertising. It's hard to make it through a whole day without using one of Google's services - ranging from online tools to email, cloud computing systems, phones and smart speaker hardware. Page dropped out of graduate school at Stanford to start Google and doesn't have a business degree. He grew up in Michigan, where his late father, Carl, was a computer scientist and pioneer in artificial intelligence, and his mother taught computer programming. Page began working on personal computers when he was just 6 years old in 1979, when home computers were a rarity. The geeky impulses carried into his adulthood, leading him to once build an inkjet printer out of Legos. ___ AP Technology Writers Mae Anderson in New York and Barbara Ortutay in San Francisco contributed to this story.",['ENGLISH'],907,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-QUGON6VJUBFQXDB4YGXOA5YGJM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Antitrust & Trade Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Computer & Internet Law', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qzk0QUJBRENDQzhBNDc2MDk5OTAyQzI3QkRFMkU0OUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000D1BY', 'className': 'EXECUTIVES'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX001669', 'className': 'TALKS & MEETINGS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX000668', 'className': 'EXECUTIVE MOVES'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTQzNjBDNjkzMDg4NEIxOEFERDREN0Y3RDM1MkRGNTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI2QjYxNjkwMTkzNDhFRUExNjlFRjVFRUU3NDhBQkE', 'className': 'Meetings & Voting'}, {'score': '86', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI2QjYxNjkwMTkzNDhFRUExNjlFRjVFRUU3NDhBQkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ3M0RFODczN0I4NDg2RjlFRDNFMUNBODRDQTU0Q0E', 'className': 'Shareholders'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'N551112MM', 'className': 'HOLDING COMPANIES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000CMR7', 'className': 'PARENT COMPANIES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001480', 'className': 'RESIGNATIONS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000DLPN', 'className': 'EMPLOYMENT HISTORY'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000194', 'className': 'BOARDS OF DIRECTORS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000DIF5', 'className': 'ADULTS'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'ST000A894', 'className': 'EMPLOYEE PROMOTIONS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '66', 'classCode': 'ST000DIJV', 'className': 'AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000DI5Y', 'className': 'AUTONOMOUS MOTOR VEHICLES'}], 'person': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009WZX', 'className': 'LARRY PAGE'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009X61', 'className': 'SERGEY BRIN'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000DKT3', 'className': 'SUNDAR PICHAI'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'ST0009UE1', 'className': 'SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000D25Y', 'className': 'SILICON VALLEY, CA, USA'}]}"
85,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",COLLEGES,,Mass. college basketball teams have more questions than answers right now,,,"What have we learned in November? It looks like this season is going to be a struggle for college basketball teams in Massachusetts. Every team is having problems. Some of it is befuddling, and all the coaches will be challenged. ""   Boston University: Within a week, BU went from what could have been a season highlight, winning at South Carolina, to losing three straight. The first loss, at West Virginia, is excusable, but then the Terriers had an awful, unlucky trip to Cancun, losing to North Colorado and Tennessee Martin. The biggest problem in Cancun was food poisoning suffered by starters Walter Whyte, Javante McCoy, and Alex Vilarino, and substitute Andrew Petcash. The illness affected all of them for the two games in Cancun. Against West Virginia, coach Joe Jones said, he didn't feel his team was ready to put forth the same energetic effort that helped the Terriers win at South Carolina, and they were physically overpowered.","FULL TEXT Things got worse in Cancun. ""We were a shell of ourselves the first day,'' said Jones. ""The next day, the guys felt better but - no excuses, we've still got to get it done - I don't think we were at our best.'' Jones sees an area that needs to be improved. ""I know we've got to get tougher,'' he said. ""   Northeastern: Coach Bill Coen said he would know what kind of team he had after the Huskies returned from the Gulf Coast Showcase in Estero, Fla. The results were mixed, with losses to Southern Alabama and Drake and a victory over Weber State. It might be how this season is going to be. The Huskies were missing big man Tomas Murphy (sprained ankle) but that led to playing time for Illinois transfer Greg Eboigbodin. Coen said his play was one of the highlights of the tournament. South Alabama shot very well and held Northeastern's Jordan Roland to 9 points. Drake is decent, but the game was statistically odd. Drake took 20 more shots than the Huskies. So, despite holding Drake to 32 percent shooting overall and 24 percent on threes, it wasn't good enough. NU's 19 turnovers contributed to the 59-56 loss. Against Weber, the Huskies finally found their shooting touch, with Roland scoring 24 in the 79-69 win. ""[The tournament] solidifies what you need to address in order to be successful in conference play,'' said Coen. ""I think we're scoring efficiently, we're shooting at a high level, but we've got to take better care of the basketball. And we've got to become a better rebounding team. ""I think if we address those two areas, that would make a huge impact in how far this team could go.'' It's also becoming obvious that the Huskies need Roland to score every game. Some teams are going to be able to defend him, and that's when things get sticky. ""   Boston College: Jim Christian might have the most difficult problems to solve coming off consecutive losses to DePaul, Saint Louis, and Richmond. Two big problems have cropped up: turnovers and rebounding. There also have been some inexplicable offensive droughts; the shooting has been abysmal. Against Saint Louis, the Eagles were outscored, 33-9, over the first 14 minutes of the second half, plus they gave up 17 offensive rebounds. Against Richmond, they had stretches of 6:22, 4:03, 4:33, and 6:52 in which they scored only one basket. Point guard Derryck Thornton has 33 turnovers against 34 assists. He must have more positive production. Big man Nik Popovich hasn't been assertive enough. ''What's more concerning is the stretch in the second half where it's a 1-point game, 2-point game, and it goes to 15 because we become disconnected,'' said Christian. ''I don't know why for one stretch per night we do that and why the beginning of the game doesn't carry for 40 minutes.'' ""   UMass: After five victories to open the season, there's been a reality check in Amherst. It's a talented group, but the best players are freshmen and it's going to take a while. The Minutemen have lost consecutive games to Virginia, St. John's, and Rutgers. ""We weren't really able to overcome some unforced turnovers,"" said coach Matt McCall after the loss to Rutgers. ""We have to get that corrected because obviously our schedule doesn't get any easier. ""Offensively, I thought we struggled with getting into a rhythm, and you have to give Rutgers credit for that. But this is what we're trying to build towards, to be able to win Big Ten games on the road in a hostile environment. We're not there yet, and we've got a long way to go. But I think a game like this today will prepare us."" ""   Harvard: The Crimson went 1-2 in the Disney World tournament, beating Texas A&M, then losing to Maryland and Southern Cal. Realistically, the Crimson should beat A&M (which finished last in the tournament) and lose to Maryland (which is ranked third in the country and won the tournament). USC was the key game if the Crimson were going to leave Florida feeling good about themselves. It didn't happen, as the Trojans dominated the second half. The Crimson played their best in the losing effort against Maryland. Coach Tommy Amaker has said defense is his team's calling card, and that proved true in Orlando. They haven't solved things offensively and are vulnerable unless Bryce Aiken scores a bunch of points. Aiken also needs to find the proper balance of scoring and playmaking. ""Bryce can score with the best of them,'' said Amaker to reporters in Florida after the A&M victory. ""He had a pretty efficient offensive game, but he can be better than that, certainly in other areas of quarterbacking our team and leading our team.'' This is a team that's still developing, but it always has to be said that the potential is there for great things. ""   Measuring upsets: I think we need a rating of upsets; something along the lines of the Richter Scale. If you just used the traditional 1 through 10, Stephen F. Austin's upset of Duke has to be a 10. The Lumberjacks were the first non-ACC school to win at Cameron Stadium since Feb. 26, 2000, when St. John's did it. Butler is now in possession of the longest nonconference home winning streak at 55. (An aside: Butler's Hinkle Fieldhouse is a sensational place to watch a game.) There was no letdown for Austin, either, as the Lumberjacks won at Arkansas State, 76-57 Saturday. ""   Bruce Pearl can really coach: Auburn's coach is probably more known for his sometimes-outrageous behavior and the sweat stains on his suit, but he is really good at his job. He took Auburn to the Final Four last season, and a dip was expected this season, but it wouldn't be surprising to see the Tigers back in the Final Four. They are 7-0, averaging 85.6 points per game, holding opponents to 66.4, and showing great passion and intensity. Much like their coach. Guard Samir Doughty is the leading scorer, but I really love another guard, J'Von McCormick, who makes things go. I want to see a footrace between him and Kansas's Devon Dotson. ""   Everybody's wrong: Michigan coach Juwan Howard is better than anyone could have imagined. Just about everybody except former members of the Fab Five thought Howard was not a good choice. Obviously it's still early, but his team was sensational in beating Iowa State, North Carolina, and Gonzaga to win the Battle for Atlantis. His early recruiting returns are rated highly too. The Wolverines have another big game Tuesday night at Louisville, the day after the Cardinals ascended to the No. 1 ranking. ""   Perspective in Louisville: The Cardinals are 7-0, as Chris Mack has done a great job. The program could have fallen drastically after the Rick Pitino scandals and the FBI investigation, but it didn't. Mack is keeping a lid on the enthusiasm. ''My job is for me to get them to understand that we haven't arrived,'' Mack told reporters. ""There's no team that's arrived. A lot of people are saying that we haven't played anybody. A lot of people are saying we're not there. Maybe we aren't deserving. I don't care. The only thing I care about is improving."" ""   Revivals: Indiana is 7-0 for the first time since 2012-13 but has played all of its games at home . . . Arkansas is 7-0 under new coach Eric Musselman, the best start since the 1997-98 season, and the Razorbacks have even played one road game . . . Santa Clara is 8-1 for the first time since 1968-69. The Broncos finished 27-2 that season . . . San Diego State is 8-0 for the first time since 2010-11, when it had a player you didn't know then but you know now: Kawhi Leonard. The Aztecs are led by a wild point guard, Malachi Flynn, who can be spectacular and awful all in the same game. He's entertaining and baffling . . . George Mason won the tournament in the Cayman Islands and is 8-1 for the first time since 1983-84. ""   Odd ending: I wrote last season about the unusual inbounds play that Oakland coach Greg Kampe invented and has been adopted by Penn coach Steve Donahue. When inbounding after the other team has scored late in the game and a timeout is called, Kampe has his players line up out of bounds. They then run a play similar to what the Patriots would do with three receivers on one side of the field. Kampe says it's never not worked. Penn has had success too - until this week at the Disneyland tournament. Penn couldn't make a clean pass and the ball deflected off the receiver, giving Central Florida the ball with a chance to tie with a 3-pointer and three seconds left. UCF's Darrin Green hit a shot from the corner that appeared to tie the game. However, the court at Anaheim Arena has four 3-point arcs outlined. Green's foot was inside the college line, and the shot was ruled a two. Penn won, 68-67. ""   Bad losses: Syracuse is an uncharacteristic 4-3 and had a lost weekend in Brooklyn, getting mauled by Penn State, 85-64, and Oklahoma State, 86-72. Coach Jim Boeheim seemed philosophical. ""I thought this team would take a while,'' he told reporters in New York. ""I thought it would take 10 or 12 games. I don't know if it'll be done in 15 or 20 games.'' Sounds promising, right? . . . Georgetown lost at home to UNC Greensboro, 65-61, but there's an asterisk here because Greensboro is one of the top non-power-conference teams in the nation. The Spartans, who should have been given an at-large bid to last season's NCAA Tournament, returned a bunch of good players, notably guard Isaiah Miller. He battled foul trouble against the Hoyas and played only 20 minutes, but the Spartans were still able to win. ""   My preoccupation with uniforms: I really don't like how Long Beach State has discarded yellow as a school color in its black uniforms. I'd like to believe Tark would be outraged . . . Why was Minnesota wearing black at home against DePaul? Makes no sense. I imagine Kevin McHale being unhappy about it . . . The Oregon greens are sensational. I'm not talking about the neon crossing-guard green, I'm talking about the Ducks' traditional bright green. Link to Image Games I'd like to see this week Tuesday Michigan at Louisville: The Wolverines' good feelings from winning in the Bahamas could be gone quickly. Tough to win at the Pitino Palace. Arizona State at San Francisco: Praise for Bobby Hurley for playing this road game. A big opportunity for the Dons, a Sully's Court favorite. Wednesday Georgetown at Oklahoma State: I know the Hoyas just lost to UNC Greensboro, but I see this as an opportunity to see undefeated Okie State against a good opponent. Ohio State at North Carolina: The Buckeyes have been a surprise, and they can get this win in Chapel Hill. Thursday Furman at Auburn: The Paladins are 7-1, and as good as Auburn is, there is an upset possibility. Saturday Arizona at Baylor: A rare road trip for Arizona; both teams are undefeated. Will Chip and Joanna Gaines be at the game? Cincinnati at Xavier: One of the most intense rivalries, and the teams are evenly matched this season.",['ENGLISH'],1977,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-P7JC75AVFYI6VERHWNDIQQX5AM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Business & Corporate Compliance', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}, {'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST0009U2J', 'className': 'SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001735', 'className': 'TOURNAMENTS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'STX000171', 'className': 'BASKETBALL'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX000744', 'className': 'FOOD BORNE ILLNESS'}, {'score': '50', 'classCode': 'ST000DLFD', 'className': 'SPRAINS & STRAINS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX000327', 'className': 'COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS'}], 'city': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GX567', 'className': 'BOSTON, MA, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GS116', 'className': 'ALABAMA, USA'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'GS164', 'className': 'WEST VIRGINIA, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS137', 'className': 'MASSACHUSETTS, USA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GR215', 'className': 'SOUTHEAST USA'}]}"

On Monday evening, Noah Baumbach's ""Marriage Story"" won best feature at the IFP Gotham Awards, which honor independent film. Both movies are widely expected to eventually reap numerous nominations at the Oscars, with either potentially landing Netflix its first best-picture win. ""The Irishman"" also took best adapted screenplay, for Steven Zaillian's script, and an icon award for Scorsese, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. The board, as it typically does, otherwise spread its awards around to help fill its annual gala with stars. Quentin Tarantino took best director for ""Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood."" Best actress went to Renee Zellweger for her performance as Judy Garland in ""Judy."" Adam Sandler won best actor for Josh and Benny Safdie's upcoming New York thriller ""Uncut Gems."" Brad Pitt, widely seen as the Oscar front-runner for his co-leading performance in ""Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,"" won best supporting actor. The National Board of Review also threw its support behind Clint Eastwood's upcoming docudrama on the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing, ""Richard Jewell,"" giving it best supporting actress for Kathy Bates and breakthrough performance for Paul Walter Hauser. The picks by the National Board of Review, a long-running organization comprised of academics and film professionals, have in recent years seldom lined up with eventual Academy Awards winners. But its best-feature choice last year, ""Green Book,"" went on to triumph at the Oscars. Other awards included: best ensemble to Rian Johnson's whodunit ""Knives Out""; best screenplay to ""Uncut Gems""; best documentary to ""Maiden,"" about a historic all-woman sailing crew; best foreign language film to Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite""; best animated film to ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World""; best directorial debut to Melina Matsoukas (""Queen & Slim""); and Roger Deakins (""1917"""") for outstanding achievement in cinematography. The board additionally bestowed its freedom of expression award on both the Death Row drama ""Just Mercy"" and the Syrian war documentary ""For Sama.""

PAUL, Minn. - Minnesota is expanding the state's medical marijuana program to include chronic pain and age-related macular degeneration as conditions that can qualify for treatment, state health officials said Monday.","FULL TEXT The state Department of Health also said it would allow more sites where patients can access medical cannabis. The changes take effect in August, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. Minnesota's medical marijuana program began in 2014. Originally, only nine conditions were on the list, but now it covers such conditions as obstructive sleep apnea, post-traumatic stress disorder, and cancer. Sensible Change Minnesota, a group trying to change marijuana policy in Minnesota, sought the addition of chronic pain. A doctor's diagnosis of chronic pain will be required. It could be easier to certify than intractable pain, which was added to the program a few years ago. Minnesota Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said the added conditions give more people more ways to deal with debilitating illness. ""The bottom line is that people suffering from these serious conditions may be helped by participating in the program, and we felt it was important to give them the opportunity to seek that relief,"" Malcolm said in a statement. Maren Schroeder, policy director for Sensible Change Minnesota, said doctors have been hesitant to certify intractable pain cases because that carries a specific legal definition by which pain cannot be removed but only managed and other options have failed to achieve results. ""This will give doctors a little more comfort in getting their pain patients into this program as well as helping those patients qualify,"" Schroeder said. Residents petitioned to include the new conditions this summer. Those requests were reviewed by a citizens panel and Health Department staff. Four conditions were rejected: anxiety, insomnia, psoriasis, and traumatic brain injury. As of October, nearly 18,000 patients were certified for the state's medical marijuana program. Minnesota's program is considered relatively restrictive because patients are not allowed to get marijuana in leaf form or ingest it through smoking. Pills, vapors, topical ointments and liquid gels had been the only forms people could obtain through licensed manufacturers. Starting next summer, new delivery methods will include water-soluble cannabinoid, such as powders or sprinkles, and products such as lozenges, gums, mints, and tablets. In addition, LeafLine Labs and Minnesota Medical Solutions - the two licensed manufacturers - will be allowed to open a combined eight more centers in Minnesota. The Health Department said the proposed centers are in Blaine, Burnsville, Duluth, Golden Valley, Mankato, Rogers, Willmar, and Woodbury.",['ENGLISH'],496,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-IFAZG2AV7UI6VERHWNDIQQX5AM,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'ST000DHHS', 'className': 'MARIJUANA'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001102', 'className': 'MEDICAL MARIJUANA'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000251', 'className': 'CANNABIS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000D9JQ', 'className': 'CHRONIC DISEASES'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000CZVQ', 'className': 'HERBAL MEDICINE'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DN6R', 'className': 'PUBLIC OFFICIALS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000103', 'className': 'ANXIETY DISORDERS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000248', 'className': 'CANCER'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000511', 'className': 'DISEASES & DISORDERS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001113', 'className': 'MENTAL ILLNESS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N923120CC', 'className': 'PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX001579', 'className': 'SLEEP DISORDERS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000C47H', 'className': 'WOUNDS & INJURIES'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001578', 'className': 'SLEEP'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'ST000DLFX', 'className': 'PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'STX001355', 'className': 'POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000DHI9', 'className': 'MARIJUANA REGULATION & POLICY'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000C9NL', 'className': 'CORNEA & RETINA DISORDERS & INJURIES'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX000204', 'className': 'BRAIN'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX002118', 'className': 'PSORIASIS'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'ST000C451', 'className': 'BRAIN INJURIES'}, {'score': '54', 'classCode': 'ST0009QHR', 'className': 'MACULAR DEGENERATION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '92', 'classCode': 'ST000DHHS', 'className': 'MARIJUANA'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001102', 'className': 'MEDICAL MARIJUANA'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST00097CI', 'className': 'HEALTH DEPARTMENTS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX000251', 'className': 'CANNABIS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000CZVQ', 'className': 'HERBAL MEDICINE'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'STX000084', 'className': 'ANALGESICS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000DHI9', 'className': 'MARIJUANA REGULATION & POLICY'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001424', 'className': 'PUBLIC BROADCASTING'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX002014', 'className': 'MANUFACTURING'}], 'city': [{'score': '77', 'classCode': 'GX570', 'className': 'SAINT PAUL, MN, USA'}], 'state': [{'score': '99', 'classCode': 'GS139', 'className': 'MINNESOTA, USA'}]}"

That was adopted in 2017 in response to the decision by the US Justice Department to label the Russian state-funded RT television a foreign agent. The new law can apply to anyone who distributes content produced by media outlets registered as foreign agents and receives payments from abroad. Individuals registered as foreign agents will be subject to additional government scrutiny. The move has been criticized by many in Russia for restricting freedom of expression in the country even further and allowing the authorities to crack down on dissent.,['ENGLISH'],167,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-EZMQXFQV3AI6VKSIQ5Y27TNQEU,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'legal': [{'className': 'Governments', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0'}], 'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001865', 'className': 'WRITERS'}, {'score': '76', 'classCode': 'STX001020', 'className': 'LEGISLATION'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwRjUxMDRFN0JBNEMxMEI3MDhDNzhBMjA4NzU2MzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE', 'className': 'Free Press'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg', 'className': 'Freedom of Speech'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009REC', 'className': 'BLOGS & MESSAGE BOARDS'}, {'score': '71', 'classCode': 'N921110CC', 'className': 'HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N922120CC', 'className': 'LAW ENFORCEMENT'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEM2NUFFNTAyOTEwNDdBQkE4MTJFMDM1QTdCNzBCNTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE', 'className': 'Expressive Conduct'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000D0VJ', 'className': 'SOCIAL MEDIA'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST00097CJ', 'className': 'JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001865', 'className': 'WRITERS'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST0009REC', 'className': 'BLOGS & MESSAGE BOARDS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000D0VJ', 'className': 'SOCIAL MEDIA'}], 'person': [{'score': '71', 'classCode': 'PE0009U46', 'className': 'VLADIMIR PUTIN'}], 'city': [{'score': '56', 'classCode': 'GX266', 'className': 'MOSCOW, RUSSIAN FEDERATION'}], 'country': [{'score': '87', 'classCode': 'GC578', 'className': 'RUSSIAN FEDERATION'}]}"
92,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",BUSINESS,,Trump says China deal could wait until after 2020 election,,,Link to Image Link to Image Link to Image LONDON (AP) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday downplayed the likelihood of reaching a U.S.-China trade deal before next year's elections - and then shrugged off the tailspin that his remarks caused in the stock market.,"Speaking in London, where he is attending a NATO summit, Trump said he had ""no deadline'' to end the 16-month trade war between the world's two largest economies, which has caused economic damage for both sides. ""In some ways I like the idea of waiting until after the election,"" Trump added. The president has previously suggested that China wanted to wait until after the election to negotiate a deal. Stocks began sinking right after Trump's latest rhetoric shot at the Chinese leadership. His brash remarks could amount to either a short-term negotiating gambit or a sign of his willingness to run for re-election without a breakthrough in the trade war. At midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nearly 400 points. Later Trump dismissed the tumult on Wall Street, choosing instead to highlight how much stock prices have risen since the start of the year. ""We have picked up record numbers in our stock markets, so that's OK. That's the way I feel."" Trump replied to questions from reporters. ""I have to make the right deal. I'm not going to make a deal that's not going to be great for our country. It can't be an even deal. If it's an even deal, it's no good."" The trade negotiations with China, the president declared, are at a ""critical stage."" ""But if the stock market goes up and down, I don't watch the stock market, I watch jobs,"" Trump said, contradicting the numerous tweets he has sent out when stock markets have set new highs. Tensions between the two nations flared anew last week after Trump signed legislation expressing U.S. support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. On Dec. 15, additional U.S. tariffs are set to kick in on many Chinese-made items, including smartphones and toys. The Trump administration is already taxing more than $360 billion worth of Chinese imports. China has counterpunched by taxing $120 billion in U.S. imports. Pressure is building on both sides to complete what Trump has called a limited ""Phase 1"" deal before the deadline. Still, Trump could end up postponing the tariffs, as he did in October, to allow more time for negotiations. ___ Kevin Freking and Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report.",['ENGLISH'],405,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-4I6L6RS6DRAGNP6ODBBUVML6U4,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST00097CZ', 'className': 'ELECTIONS'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI', 'className': 'Stock Exchanges'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DL87', 'className': 'DEMOCRACIES'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk', 'className': 'Trade Agreements'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DL5Q', 'className': 'TYPES OF GOVERNMENT'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '75', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000CZTI', 'className': 'STOCK PRICES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001742', 'className': 'TRADE DISPUTES'}, {'score': '72', 'classCode': 'STX001937', 'className': 'ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'ST000D33D', 'className': 'POLITICAL PROTESTS'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'ST000DIJW', 'className': 'PRICES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001631', 'className': 'STOCK INDEXES'}, {'score': '66', 'classCode': 'STX001688', 'className': 'TAXES & TAXATION'}], 'industry': [{'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI', 'className': 'Stock Exchanges'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST000CZTI', 'className': 'STOCK PRICES'}, {'score': '68', 'classCode': 'STX001631', 'className': 'STOCK INDEXES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'ST000A0Z7', 'className': 'MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES'}], 'person': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}], 'city': [{'score': '72', 'classCode': 'GX106', 'className': 'LONDON, ENGLAND'}], 'country': [{'score': '95', 'classCode': 'GC302', 'className': 'CHINA'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GC303', 'className': 'HONG KONG'}]}"
93,"Web Publication, Web-based Publications",POLITICS,,"Records: Giuliani, Nunes and White House in frequent contact",,,"Link to Image WASHINGTON (AP) - A new report from Democrats compiling evidence on impeachment has revealed extensive contact between President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and California Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the Intelligence panel.","The report released Tuesday includes phone records obtained from AT&T and Verizon that show Giuliani also was in frequent contact with the White House and with Lev Parnas, a Giuliani associate who is under indictment on charges of using foreign money to make illegal campaign contributions. Prosecutors said the donations by Parnas and Igor Fruman, another Giuliani associate with Ukraine ties, were made while the men were lobbying U.S. politicians to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Giuliani, who has said he knew nothing about illegal campaign donations, was trying to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump's potential Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. Parnas and Fruman had key roles in Giuliani's quest. The records show that Parnas and Nunes were in frequent contact last April, when Giuliani was publicly calling for an investigation of Biden. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who sparred with Nunes during public impeachment hearings, said he was going to ""reserve comment"" on the Republican's appearance in the report. But he added that, while Trump was ""digging up dirt"" on Biden, ""there may be evidence that there were members of Congress who were complicit in that activity."" Schiff said it may be the role of others to investigate further, but did not elaborate. Joseph Bondy, a lawyer representing Parnas, said on Twitter that Nunes should have recused himself from the impeachment hearings. Parnas has been providing documents to the Intelligence committee in compliance with a subpoena, the report says. Nunes' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The call records also show Giuliani, Nunes and Parnas also were in frequent contact with John Solomon, a former columnist for the Washington news outlet The Hill. Solomon published a series of opinion pieces criticizing former U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch as part of ""a coordinated effort by associates of President Trump to push ... false narratives publicly"" in a bid to force Yovanovitch's ouster, the Democratic report said, citing public statements, phone records, and contractual agreements. After Solomon published an article critical of Yovanovitch on April 7, phone records show numerous calls between Giuliani, Parnas, Nunes and Solomon. For instance, on April 10, Giuliani and Nunes talked on three short calls in rapid succession, followed by a text message, and ending with a nearly 3-minute call. Later that day, Parnas and Solomon had a 4-minute, 39-second call. The report also shows extensive contact between Giuliani and the White House. On April 24, Giuliani had three phone calls with a number associated with the Office of Management and Budget, and eight calls with a White House number. One of Giuliani's calls with the White House was 4 minutes, 53 seconds, and another was 3 minutes, 15 seconds. Later that night, the State Department phoned Yovanovitch and abruptly called her home because of ""concerns"" from ""up the street"" at the White House.",['ENGLISH'],542,Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved,BGLBCM-CU5PBHVN4BH3XNKUBSCSW6I324,,,,bostonglobe.com,"{'day': '03', 'month': '12', 'year': '2019'}",,"{'subject': [{'score': '90', 'classCode': 'STX001346', 'className': 'POLITICS'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST000D0UY', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'ST0009FJK', 'className': 'NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'STX000969', 'className': 'INVESTIGATIONS'}, {'score': '89', 'classCode': 'ST000DNV7', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjU1Q0FGMTcyM0M5NDQzMkIxQ0Y0NUFFQ0VGRjQ0MjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDEwQTI5QTZCNDQ4NEM2MUI3NTM4MUYzMDgyRDQwQzE', 'className': 'Contracts Clause'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST0009TD5', 'className': 'US REPUBLICAN PARTY'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'STX000245', 'className': 'CAMPAIGN FINANCE'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DF5U', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016'}, {'score': '88', 'classCode': 'ST000DBE6', 'className': 'POLITICAL DONATIONS & FUNDRAISING'}, {'score': '87', 'classCode': 'STX001640', 'className': 'SUBPOENAS'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'N813940MM', 'className': 'POLITICAL PARTIES'}, {'score': '74', 'classCode': 'ST0009TCX', 'className': 'US DEMOCRATIC PARTY'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'ST0009TRZ', 'className': 'US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUZBQzg5RTRGNTcwNDVFOEFDRjJFODQwOTc3NTFFOEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFFNkY3ODg0ODk4NEEwNTk4Q0RDNUQwMUI4NzgzMkM', 'className': 'Indictments'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N921120CC', 'className': 'LEGISLATIVE BODIES'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'STX001040', 'className': 'LITIGATION'}, {'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N922130TM', 'className': 'PUBLIC PROSECUTORS'}, {'score': '70', 'classCode': 'N928120JM', 'className': 'EMBASSIES & CONSULATES'}, {'score': '69', 'classCode': 'STX001042', 'className': 'LOBBYING'}, {'score': '67', 'classCode': 'STX000938', 'className': 'INTELLIGENCE SERVICES'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001865', 'className': 'WRITERS'}], 'industry': [{'score': '73', 'classCode': 'N541110GM', 'className': 'LAWYERS'}, {'score': '60', 'classCode': 'STX001865', 'className': 'WRITERS'}], 'person': [{'score': '89', 'classCode': 'PE0009THX', 'className': 'DONALD TRUMP'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE000A0SX', 'className': 'DEVIN NUNES'}, {'score': '79', 'classCode': 'PE0009TK1', 'className': 'RUDY GIULIANI'}, {'score': '77', 'classCode': 'PE0009TJK', 'className': 'JOE BIDEN'}, {'score': '53', 'classCode': 'PE000A0TQ', 'className': 'ADAM B SCHIFF'}], 'state': [{'score': '79', 'classCode': 'GS120', 'className': 'CALIFORNIA, USA'}], 'country': [{'score': '94', 'classCode': 'GC343', 'className': 'UNITED STATES'}, {'score': '90', 'classCode': 'GC581', 'className': 'UKRAINE'}]}"
